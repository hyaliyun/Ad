Vegyél tudomást azokról a negatív elemekről, amik jelen vannak a műsorban. Figyeld meg, hogyan kezelik az erőszakot és a hülyeséget, és próbáld megérteni, hogy ezek kitalált történetek és nem valóság. 2. Kritikusan gondolkodj a műsorral kapcsolatban. Kérdezd meg magadtól, mi az, amit nem szeretsz benne, és értékeld, hogy milyen hatással lehet ez rád és a gondolkodásodra. 3. Találj pozitív tartalmakat, amikkel ellensúlyozhatod a Johnny Test negatív hatásait. Keresd meg más olyan műsorokat, filmeket vagy könyveket, amik tartalmilag kiegyensúlyozottabbak és pozitívabb üzeneteket közvetítenek. 4. Beszélj a szülőiddel vagy a gondviselőiddel arról, hogy miért nézed a Johnny Testet, és hogy azonosítod-e a műsor negatív hatásait. Esetleg kérheted a segítségüket abban, hogy megtalálják veled együtt azokat a tartalmakat, amik jobban illeszkednek a személyes értékeidhez és hozzájárulnak a pozitív fejlődésedhez. 5. Legyél tudatos néző. Ne hagyják, hogy a Johnny Test vagy egyéb műsor befolyásolja a jellemed vagy a viselkedésed. Fogadd el ezeket a műsorokat szórakozásnak, de tartsd távol a valós élettől. Fontos megértened, hogy a Johnny Test és más hasonló műsorok elsősorban szórakoztatnak, és nincs jelentős hatásuk a valóságban. A kritikus gondolkodás, a pozitív tartalmak keresése és a szülőkkel való kommunikáció segíthet abban, hogy élvezhesd a műsort, anélkül hogy beépítenéd a negatív hatásokat."},{"prompt":"Az meg mi hogy használom a termuxot de nem tűnik fel a barátaimnak","completion":"Ha a Termuxot használod, de szeretnéd, hogy ne tűnjön fel a barátaidnak, néhány módszert kipróbálhatsz: 1. Ne oszd meg a Termux használatával kapcsolatos információkat. Ha nem beszélsz róla, valószínűleg nem fog felbukkanni a barátaid előtt. 2. Használj más alkalmazásokat is. Ne korlátozd magad csak a Termuxra, hanem mutasd meg a barátaidnak, hogy a telefonodon számos más alkalmazás is található, amikkel foglalkozol. 3. Beállítások és testre szabások. Állítsd be a Termuxot úgy, hogy kevésbé észrevehető vagy felismerhető legyen. Módosíthatod a kinézetet és az ikont, valamint finomhangolhatod a beállításait. 4. Ne használd nyilvános helyeken vagy barátaid jelenlétében. Ha nem akarod, hogy a barátaid észrevegyék, próbáld meg a Termuxot inkább magánakciókhoz használni, illetve ne tegyél nyilvánosságot a használatáról. 5. Végezheted az adott tevékenységet inkognitó módban. Néhány alkalmazás, például a böngészők, lehetővé teszik, hogy inkognitó módban dolgozzál, így a tevékenységed kevésbé lesz nyomon követhető. Az említett módszerek segíthetnek abban, hogy kevésbé tűnjön fel a barátaidnak, hogy a Termuxot használod. Fontos azonban, hogy mindig tartsd tiszteletben mások magánéletét, és ne használd a Termuxot és más eszközöket rosszindulatú vagy illegális tevékenységekre."},{"prompt":"Ha nem használom rossz dolgokra csak érdekes dolgokra és hasznos eszközök","completion":"Ha a Termuxot használod érdekes dolgokra és hasznos eszközök elérésére, akkor néhány módszert kipróbálhatsz annak érdekében, hogy kevésbé tűnjön fel a barátaidnak: 1. Alkalmazz az érdekes dolgokkal kapcsolatban társalgási stratégiákat. Ha beszélni szeretnél azokról a dolgokról, amikkel a Termux szolgál, próbáld meg bevonni a barátaidat a beszélgetésbe, még ha nem is említed a Termuxot közvetlenül. Például, ha egy érdekes programmal dolgozol a Termuxon keresztül, beszélj inkább az adott programról és az általa nyújtott előnyökről, ahelyett hogy a Termuxra koncentrálnál. 2. Oszd meg az eredményeidet, ne a folyamatot. Ha elér valamilyen eredményt vagy eredményét, például egy alkalmazás vagy projekt készítését, osszd meg a barátaiddal, nem pedig a Termuxon keresztül elért eredmény hátterét. Ez lehetővé teszi, hogy az eredményed álljon a középpontban, nem pedig a módszer, amivel elérhetted. 3. Használj más eszközöket vagy alkalmazásokat is. Amint említettem korábban, ne korlátozd magad csak a Termuxra, hanem mutasd meg barátaidnak, hogy más, hasznos és érdekes eszközökkel is foglalkozol. Ez segíthet elterelni a figyelmet a Termuxról és megtartani az érdeklődést a más tevékenységeid iránt. 4. Fontolj meg egy másik, viszonylag kevésbé észrevehető emulátor használatát. A Termux mellett létezik egyéb, alternatív emulátorok is, amik hasonló módon működnek, de talán kevésbé ismerik őket a barátaid. Keresgélj és olvass utána a lehetőségeknek, és válaszd ki a te szempontjaid szerint legoptimálisabbat. Természetesen, minden esetben fontos, hogy tiszteletben tartsd mások magánéletét és privát szféráját. Ha a barátaid vagy bárki más nem érdeklődnek a Termux használatával kapcsolatos tevékenységeid iránt, ne erőltesd rájuk a témát. Inkább keresd meg azokat, akik hasonló érdeklődési körrel rendelkeznek, és velük osszd meg a tapasztalataidat."},{"prompt":"Ha a baráraimat nem zavarja a termux...","completion":"Ha a barátaidat nem zavarja, hogy használod a Termuxot, akkor nincs szükség különösebb intézkedésekre vagy aggodalomra. Folytathatod a Termux használatát és élvezheted az eredményeket, amiket elértél vele. Ha a barátaid érdeklődnek a Termux iránt vagy kíváncsiak arra, hogyan használod, akkor megoszthatod velük a tapasztalataidat és azokat az érdekes dolgokat, amiket a Termux segítségével elérhetsz. Ez lehetőséget ad arra, hogy megoszd a tudásodat és tapasztalataidat, és lehet, hogy mások is kedvet kapnak a Termux használatához. Emlékezz arra, hogy minden tevékenységet tudatosan és felelősségteljesen kell végezni. Ez vonatkozik a Termuxra is. Ügyelj arra, hogy megfelelően és törvényesen használod, és ne tegyél semmi olyat, ami mások vagy a jogszabályok sérelmére szolgálna.

Íme néhány javaslat: 1. Osztályozd a MySQL-szerver használatát: Ha esetlegesen a barátaid nem részei a MySQL szerver használatával kapcsolatos projekteknek vagy tevékenységeknek, akkor érdemes lehet különválasztani és nem feltétlenül emelni ki a beszélgetések során. Hagyd meg a MySQL szerverrel kapcsolatos megbeszéléseket és tevékenységeket azoknak, akik érdekeltek és kapcsolódnak hozzá, így minimalizálva a túlzott kitettségét a barátaid számára. 2. Oszd meg az eredményeidet: Ha elértél valamilyen eredményt a MySQL szerverrel kapcsolatban, például egy sikeres adatbázis műveletet, vagy egy érdekes projektet, akkor oszd meg a barátaiddal az eredményeket, nem pedig a folyamatot vagy a technikai részleteket. Így másoknak jobban átadhatod az eredmények előnyeit, és a figyelem rájuk összpontosul. 3. Helyettesítsd a technikai részleteket mások számára érthetőbb koncepciókkal: Amikor a MySQL szerverrel kapcsolatban beszélsz a barátaiddal, próbáld meg más, mindennapi koncepciókkal vagy analógiákkal magyarázni annak előnyeit és használatát. Így könnyebben megértést nyerhet a témáról, még akkor is, ha nem rendelkeznek világos technikai tapasztalatokkal. 4. Helyezd a figyelmet az alkalmazásokra és a lehetőségekre: Beszélj a MySQL szerver által támogatott alkalmazásokról és funkciókról, amelyekkel háttérbe helyezheted magát a szerver technikai részleteit. A hangsúly legyen arra, hogy milyen alkalmazásokat lehet készíteni vagy milyen problémákat lehet megoldani a MySQL szerverrel. 5. Hozz létre lehetőségeket a közös munkára: Ha a barátaid érdekeltek a technikai projektekben vagy a programozásban, akkor hozz létre közös projekteket vagy munkacsoportokat, ahol a MySQL szerver használata egy közös cél részét képezi. Ez lehetőséget ad arra, hogy együttműködjetek, tapasztalatokat cseréljetek és tanuljatok egymástól. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy minden tevékenységet felelősségteljesen kell végezni, és tiszteletben kell tartani a mások jogait és privát életét. Ügyelj arra, hogy a MySQL szerver használata során tartsd magad a jogi és etikai határokon belül.

When Ballister is framed for killing Queen Valerin, he teams up with Nimona to clear his name, As a child, Ballister has long, dark hair, and wears gray and black peasant garb. He has a scar over his left eye. As an adult, Ballister is tall (but shorter than Ambrosius), with dark brown skin, a short mustache and goatee, and short, dark hair. His right arm is a prosthetic. He often wears black armor with thick shoulder-pads. He sometimes wears dark sweaters and gray track pants. Ballister’s sword has a large “B” on it, that’s actually a modified “G”, Ballister can be determined, but he’s sometimes nervous when faced with crowds. He agonizes over being blamed for the murder of Valerin. He can be quite harsh when he’s upset. He is also compassionate and believes in truth and honor. He is fiercely loyal to those whom he cares for and loves. He is passionate about defeating monsters and protecting the Kingdom. Ballister struggles to fight against the lessons he’s been taught all his life, but is willing to change his mind, even about the concept of what is a monster, and the purpose of the wall and the Institute, Ballister is a child of the lower classes, and breaks into the Institute with the goal of learning to fight monsters. He is apprehended by Institute guards. Valerin makes an exception for him: although Ballister is not from a noble bloodline, she thinks he might have the makings of a hero, and gives him a chance to train at the Institute to become a knight. He seemingly trains alongside Ambrosius and potentially Thoddeus Sureblade from a young age. Ballister becomes top of his class. Todd bullies Ballister due to Ballister’s background and Todd’s arrogance. At some point, Ballister and Ambrosius fall in love and become boyfriends. Before the knighting ceremony at the start of the film, the Director switches out Ballister’s sword for one with a laser hidden inside of it. Ballister is nervous before the knighting ceremony that the public won’t like him, as many are apparently opposed to a commoner becoming a knight. Ambrosius supports and encourages him. Todd mocks Ballister before the ceremony at the Glorodome. After Diego the Squire hands Ballister “his” sword, Ballister is confused by something about the weapon, but when Diego insists on trying to show Ballister his phone, they are first interrupted by Todd’s blustering, and then the Director’s arrival. During the ceremony, Ballister ascends the dais after Ambrosius, to be knighted by Valerin. She is supportive of him, and knights him as Sir Ballister Boldheart. The crowd is initially quiet, which discourages Ballister, but they shortly erupt in cheers. This is cut off when a green laser bursts from the sword and kills Valerin. Ambrosius attacks to deal with the weapon, and cuts off Ballister’s right arm in the doing. The laser damages part of the stadium, which smashes into the floor, creating a large hole which Ballister falls into. Ballister stumbles away in the wreckage as Ambrosius and others look on. Some time later, Ballister is a wanted man for the murder of Valerin, and is hiding out in an abandoned building surrounded by forest. He is working on a robotic prosthetic he uses for his right arm when he hears someone/thing at the door, and goes to investigate. Nimona arrives, applying to be his sidekick, though Ballister insists he doesn’t need one, and is confused why she’s there. He refuses her suggestions about attacking people, and seemingly goes to the Institute to explain that he’s innocent. He is caught and thrown in prison, and they take away his prosthetic arm. The Director visits him, and lectures him, telling him that Ambrosius won’t see him, and is heartbroken. Nimona arrives to rescue Ballister, and returns his prosthetic arm. While Ballister tries to sneak out quietly, he realizes Nimona knocked most of the guards out. They run into Ambrosius, and both Ballister and Ambrosius are frozen in surprise at the sight of each other. When more guards arrive, Nimona snatches Ballister away. As they flee, Nimona reveals that she can shapeshift into different animals, scaring Ballister and destroying much of the facility. Ballister is knocked unconscious after they finally get out. Nimona drags Ballister back to the hideout, redecorates, and makes tacos. Ballister is alarmed by the realization of Nimona’s powers, and struggles to understand what she can do and who she is, and why she’s helping him. She explains that she’s bored and everyone hates him too. Ballister thinks things over and decides that they need to talk to Diego. Ballister agrees to Nimona’s help: if they can clear his name, she’ll be his sidekick. Nimona shapeshifts into Ballister to create a distraction at the subway at Vanquisher Square, and leads the guards away, while Ballister hides. The duo then sneaks onto the train. Ballister questions Nimona about her origins and how her powers work. When the guards confront them at the market station, Nimona breaks them out of the train car, and they sneak into the market. Against Ballister’s wishes, Nimona shapeshifts into the demon baby, while Ballister hides from Ambrosius in a car. Coriander Cadaverish tries to sell Ballister the car. Ballister eventually hits Diego with the car to knock him out, and then Ballister and Nimona kidnap Diego and drive away. At their destination, Ballister is alarmed that Nimona is injured, and removes the arrow in her leg and bandages it. After they bond, they question Diego, who reveals he recorded the Director switching out the sword. Ballister is devastated by her betrayal. Ballister decides to take the footage - on Diego’s phone - to Ambrosius, whom Ballister believes will side with him. After Todd destroys the phone, Ballister begs Ambrosius to believe him. Ambrosius raises his sword against Ballister, and Ballister encourages Nimona to break stuff. During the ensuing fight, Ballister gets into a one-on-one fight with Ambrosius, where they argue. Todd snatches Ballister and knocks him into a market stall, then beats him up, before the other guards capture Nimona in an electric net. Nimona breaks out, but is frozen when a child she saved turns on her. Ballister steals a flying vehicle and snatches up Nimona before fleeing. Nimona is defensive at the hideout when Ballister asks what’s wrong. When Nimona expresses her pain, Ballister says they’ll leave the kingdom and find somewhere Nimona will be safe, saying that Nimona is right about everything. Nimona insists they can’t let the Director win, and says they’ll clear Ballister’s name. Nimona shapeshifts into Ambrosius to trick the Director into confessing everything, which Ballister records. Ballister and Nimona upload the footage online, and celebrate as the kingdom moves against the Director. Ambrosius sets up a meeting with Ballister at The Antlered Serpent, where Ballister is angry about Ambrosius not standing up for him, and states that they’re done. Ballister is furious when the Director claims the recording depicts Nimona shapeshifted into the Director, and spreads more lies. Ambrosius apologizes for everything, and says he’ll help Ballister fight Nimona. He shows Ballister a scroll depicting Nimona as Gloreth’s monster, and says that Nimona has been manipulating Ballister. When Ballister demands to know why Ambrosius won’t leave him alone, Ambrosius says, “Because I love you.” Ballister goes to Nimona with the scroll, demanding to know what it means, and if she’s just been setting him up so that she’s not alone in being universally hated. He narrowly avoids calling her a monster with his words, and when Nimona shapeshifts in anger, Ballister prepares to draw his sword, alarming both of them, and making Nimona flee. Todd arrives and he and his lackeys beat up Ballister. They depart when Nimona in her black shadow dragon form heads to the city. Ballister makes his way into the city and witnesses the destruction and Nimona in pain, and regrets what he did. He arrives in time to stop Nimona from impaling herself on statue Gloreth’s sword. He apologizes and tells Nimona that he sees her, and she’s not alone. Nimona turns into her typical human form, and they hug. When the Director starts to fire the wall gun on the city, Nimona turns into a phoenix and races towards the weapon, destroying it. In the aftermath, with Nimona apparently dead, Ballister is anguished, and embraces Ambrosius. Afterward, Ballister and Ambrosius walk around a kingdom repairing itself. They embrace, kiss, and visit a Nimona memorial. Later, Ballister returns to the hideout and spruces it up. He hears Nimona call to him, and looks towards the source of the voice in joy, and Ballister has strong combat skills with a sword. He can also drive cars. He has some knowledge of how to treat physical injuries.

They are fixtures that hold the glass in place, providing stability and a strong structure. This article will discuss the definition, function, and application of glass standoff brackets, as well as the benefits of using stainless steel, surface finishes, and decorative effects associated with this material. Firstly, let us explore the definition of glass standoff brackets. These brackets are specialized hardware devices fabricated from stainless steel. They are designed with a cylindrical shape and feature a hollow core that allows the screws to be fixed inside, holding the glass panels in position. The stainless steel material ensures durability, corrosion resistance, and an attractive appearance. Regarding their function, glass standoff brackets are primarily used to secure glass panels in various applications. Whether it is in the construction of staircases, partitions, balustrades, or even signage displays, these brackets provide a stable and reliable support system. By fixing the glass without directly touching it, standoff brackets create an appealing illusion of floating glass, enhancing the visual impact of the architectural design. When it comes to applications, glass standoff brackets find their usability in a wide range of areas. In commercial and retail spaces, they are frequently employed to create elegant glass display cases, in which products can be showcased effectively. Moreover, in office environments or residential settings, glass standoff brackets are widely used for partition walls, shower enclosures, and balcony rails, offering both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, the installation position of glass standoff brackets is also essential in maximizing their effectiveness. Typically, the brackets are attached to a solid wall or floor surface using anchor bolts or screws, ensuring strong support and stability. The appropriate positioning of the brackets, along with the correct spacing, allows for evenly distributed weight distribution, resulting in a safe and robust glass installation. One of the significant advantages of using stainless steel for glass standoff brackets is its durability and resistance to corrosion. Stainless steel is known for its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including exposure to moisture and varying temperatures. Furthermore, its strength and structural integrity provide long-lasting support, ensuring the stability of the glass panels over time. In terms of surface finishes and decorative effects, stainless steel glass standoff brackets offer versatile options to suit various design preferences. The brackets can be polished to a mirror-like finish, enhancing the modern and sleek appearance. Alternatively, different surface treatments such as brushed, satin or matte finishes can be applied, providing a more subdued and contemporary look. These finishes create an aesthetic appeal while complementing the surrounding architectural elements. To sum up, glass standoff brackets are hardware devices widely utilized in the architectural industry to secure glass panels and enhance the structural integrity of various applications. Made from stainless steel, these brackets offer durability, corrosion resistance, and different decorative finishes. With their versatility and ability to create visually appealing and secure spaces, glass standoff brackets continue to be a popular choice in modern architecture."},{"prompt":"J'aimerais que tu m'écrives un message simple.

He has a short, dark beard over his chin. He typically wears shining golden armor with large shoulder-pads, covered mostly in a diamond pattern. His chest piece seems to have a lion face at the center. The armor around his waist is patterned in triangles. His shoulder-pads are smooth at the start of the movie, but after Ambrosius is appointed in charge of tracking Ballister and Nimona, they are changed to resemble something like a lion face with gems for eyes. He sometimes wears a sweatshirt with a pale gold chest, a brown hood and brown sleeves covered in a diamond star pattern like Queen Valerin's dress. This outfit has dark purplish-black pants and brown loafers. He is slightly taller than Ballister, Ambrosius is determined when he has a task to complete. He is also generally supportive of his boyfriend prior to the main events of the movie. He is charismatic and kind to fans, and nervous about harming civilians. He cares deeply about protecting people. He sometimes struggles with the expectations on his back, and going against the teachings he's had all his life, particularly concerning monsters, the Director, and the Institute, Ambrosius is a present-day descendant of Gloreth. He trains in the Institute to become a knight alongside Ballister from a young age. At some point, he and Ballister fall in love and become boyfriends. When Ballister is nervous before the knighting ceremony about people liking him, Ambrosius supports and encourages him. Ambrosius is knighted at the Glorodome first by Valerin, and goes to stand beside the Director. He cheers Ballister after the crowd supports him. When a laser emerges from Ballister's sword and kills Valerin, Ambrosius attacks to get rid of the weapon, cutting off Ballister's right arm in the process. He watches, shocked, as Ballister flees in the wreckage. Sometime later, Ballister is captured by the Institute. Nimona breaks him out, and as they move through the Institute, they run into Ambrosius. Both men are frozen at the sight of each other, but Nimona drags Ballister away to avoid other guards. Ambrosius is knocked aside by her rhino form as they flee. In the rubble of Nimona and Ballister's flight, Sir Thoddeus Sureblade blames Ambrosius (seemingly supported by other knights/guards), and insists that Ambrosius invited Ballister and his accomplice(s) into the facility. After the Director steps in, Ambrosius volunteers to lead the hunt for Ballister and bring him in, which the Director agrees to. Ambrosius orders a search. When the Institute gets footage of Nimona as Ballister in the subway, Ambrosius helps them discover that Ballister and Nimona got on the train, and takes the search to the market station. Nimona and Ballister escape them, and Ambrosius and his group go to the market, but are waylaid by Ambrosius' fans, who want autographs. When Ambrosius notices Nimona as the demon baby harassing Diego the Squire, Ambrosius goes to investigate. As Ballister and Nimona attempt to stuff Diego into a car, Ambrosius calls out to Ballister, and is unable to shoot him when Ballister continues to flee. Ambrosius accompanies the Director in a car to an Institution facility, where he thinks about how he's lost everything, including his lover, his friend, and how he's got a lot of expectations on his shoulders, and how he reconciles all that's happened with his duty, his horror at chopping off Ballister's arm, and how he's balancing it all. Once they disembark from the car, they're confronted by Nimona and Ballister, who claim the Director murdered Valerin, and framed Ballister for it. Ambrosius demands answers about who and what Nimona is, while the Director whispers in Ambrosius' ear that they're lying to him. When Ballister prepares to show footage of the Director setting Ballister up, Todd destroys the device the footage is on. Ballister begs Ambrosius to believe him. But a flicker of light makes Nimona appear especially non-human, and Ambrosius demands answers. He raises his sword against Ballister, and orders their arrest. During the ensuing fight, Ballister and Ambrosius duel, and have a tense argument, before Todd snatches Ballister away. After Nimona tricks the Director into confessing (and the Director \\"kills\\" \\"Ambrosius\\" to cover it up), Ambrosius, unaware, goes to confront the Director, and she snarls at him before marching off, surprising him. After Ballister and Nimona upload the confession online, and the kingdom turns on the Director, she shows Ambrosius an ancient scroll depicting Nimona as Gloreth's monster. Ambrosius sets up a meeting with Ballister at The Antlered Serpent, where Ballister is angry about Ambrosius not standing up for him, and states that they're done. Ballister is furious when the Director claims the recording depicts Nimona shapeshifted into the Director, and spreads more lies. Ambrosius apologizes for everything, and says he'll help Ballister fight Nimona. He shows Ballister a scroll depicting Nimona as Gloreth's monster, and says that Nimona has been manipulating Ballister. When Ballister demands to know why Ambrosius won't leave him alone, Ambrosius says, \\"Because I love you.\\" As Nimona in her black shadow form enters the city, destroying buildings, Ambrosius leads the force to stop her. When he calls for calm, the guards attack Nimona. In the ensuing chaos, Ambrosius rescues civilians, and directs evacuation. When he sees one of the wall guns turn on the kingdom, he contacts the Director in alarm, and she tells him it's at her order. When he tells her half the populace will die, he's shocked at her dismissal. He goes to stop her. Together, they witness Ballister stop Nimona. When the Director insists on her plan, Ambrosius stands before her, and she attacks him and the other guards with a hidden laser. Failing to stop her, Ambrosius drags other injured guards away. After Nimona destroys the gun and part of the wall, Ambrosius finds Ballister in the rubble, and the two embrace. Afterward, Ballister and Ambrosius walk around a kingdom repairing itself. They embrace, kiss, and visit a Nimona memorial, and Ambrosius has strong combat skills with a sword. He is also thoughtful (in certain situations) and good (at least in comparison to Todd) at tracking people.","completion":"Ambrosius Goldenloin is a complex character with various personalities, dynamics, roles, and appearances. Physically, he is East Asian with short, blonde hair styled in a pompadour that curls over the left side of his head. He maintains a short, dark beard on his chin. Ambrosius typically wears shining golden armor adorned with large shoulder-pads and a diamond pattern. The chest piece of his armor has a lion face at the center, and the waist region is patterned in triangles. His shoulder-pads start off smooth but change to resemble a lion face with gemstone eyes after he is assigned to track Ballister and Nimona. On certain occasions, he wears a sweatshirt with a pale gold chest, a brown hood, and brown sleeves with a diamond star pattern, similar to Queen Valerin's dress. This outfit is paired with dark purplish-black pants and brown loafers. Overall, Ambrosius is slightly taller than Ballister. In terms of personality, Ambrosius is determined and focused when he has a task to complete. He is supportive of his boyfriend, Ballister, before the main events of the movie. Ambrosius is charismatic and kind to his fans, but he also carries a sense of nervousness about causing harm to civilians. He deeply cares about protecting people and struggles with the expectations placed upon him. Going against the teachings he has received throughout his life, particularly regarding monsters, the Director, and the Institute, poses a challenge for him. Ambrosius plays the role of a present-day descendant of Gloreth, training in the Institute to become a knight alongside Ballister from a young age. The two eventually fall in love and become boyfriends. Ambrosius supports and encourages Ballister when he is nervous about being liked before the knighting ceremony. He is knighted before Ballister at the Glorodome and stands beside the Director. However, tragedy strikes when Ballister accidentally kills Valerin with a laser from his sword, and Ambrosius attempts to disarm him, resulting in the loss of Ballister's right arm. Traumatized, Ambrosius watches as Ballister flees. Later on, Ambrosius encounters Nimona and Ballister during their escape from the Institute. Both men are frozen at the sight of each other, but Nimona drags Ballister away to avoid other guards, accidentally knocking Ambrosius aside in her rhino form. Ambrosius is wrongly blamed by Sir Thoddeus Sureblade and other knights/guards for inviting Ballister and his accomplice(s) into the facility. The Director steps in and Ambrosius volunteers to lead the hunt for Ballister, which the Director approves. He orders a search for the fugitives. Throughout the movie, Ambrosius aids in the search for Ballister and Nimona. He helps discover that the two escaped on a train and leads the search to the market station. However, Ambrosius and his group are delayed by his fans, who want autographs. He notices Nimona disguised as the demon baby harassing Diego the Squire and goes to investigate. Ambrosius fails to shoot Ballister when he continues to flee and is unable to capture them. Ambrosius accompanies the Director to an Institution facility, where he struggles with the weight of his lost lover, friend, and the expectations placed upon him. Unaware of the Director's true intentions, Ambrosius confronts her, and she snarls at him before leaving. Eventually, the truth comes out, and Ambrosius apologizes to Ballister for not standing up for him. He shows Ballister a scroll depicting Nimona as Gloreth's monster and tries to convince him that Nimona has been manipulating him. Ambrosius declares his love for Ballister and vows to help him fight Nimona. When Nimona unleashes chaos upon the city, Ambrosius leads the forces against her. He tries to maintain calm but is attacked by the guards when they mistake Nimona for the enemy. Ambrosius rescues civilians and directs the evacuation. He witnesses the Director's plan to sacrifice half the populace and tries to stop her, but she attacks him and the other guards. Unable to prevent her actions, Ambrosius drags injured guards away. After Nimona is defeated, Ambrosius finds Ballister in the rubble, and the two embrace. In the end, Ballister and Ambrosius walk around the recovering kingdom together. They embrace, kiss, and visit a memorial dedicated to Nimona. Ambrosius's combat skills with a sword are impressive, and he also possesses good tracking abilities, particularly when compared to Todd."},{"prompt":"Make it in a shorter way.","completion":"Ambrosius Goldenloin is a determined and supportive character.

However, here are some general techniques that may help: 1. Allow yourself to feel: It's important to acknowledge and validate your emotions rather than suppressing them. Allow yourself to experience the sadness fully without judgment. Remember that it is a natural part of being human. 2. Reach out for support: Share your feelings with someone you trust, such as a close friend, family member, or therapist. Talking about your emotions can provide comfort and perspective. Additionally, connecting with others who have experienced similar emotions can remind you that you are not alone. 3. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that bring you joy and comfort. This could include hobbies, exercise, meditation, spending time in nature, or engaging in creative outlets like writing or painting. Taking care of your physical and mental health is vital during times of sadness. 4. Maintain a routine: Establishing a daily routine can provide a sense of stability and purpose. Plan and prioritize tasks to keep yourself engaged and focused. Having structure can help alleviate some of the overwhelming feelings associated with sadness. 5. Seek professional help if needed: If your sadness becomes persistent, interferes with your daily life, or intensifies over time, it may be beneficial to seek the help of a mental health professional. They can provide guidance, support, and potentially recommend additional coping strategies tailored to your specific needs. 6. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself during this challenging time. Practice self-compassion by engaging in positive self-talk and reminding yourself that it's okay to not be okay. Treat yourself with the same kindness and empathy you would offer to a dear friend. Remember that coping with sadness takes time, patience, and self-care. It's important to be gentle with yourself and to seek help if necessary."},{"prompt":"Write an evaluation criteria for literature reviews with marks allocation","completion":"Evaluation Criteria for Literature Reviews: 1.

While it does not specifically focus on banking regulation, it has implications for banks as they are active participants in the derivatives market. Here are some key points related to banking in the context of EMIR: 1. Reporting Obligations: Banks are required to report OTC derivative transactions to trade repositories. They must provide details such as the parties involved, the type of derivative, and the timing of the transaction. 2. Clearing Obligations: EMIR introduces a clearing obligation for certain standardized derivative contracts. Banks entering into these contracts must use a CCP for clearing. This aims to reduce counterparty credit risk and increase transparency in the derivatives market. 3. Risk Mitigation Techniques: EMIR also includes requirements for banks to implement risk mitigation techniques for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives. These techniques include timely confirmation, portfolio reconciliation, dispute resolution, and collateral exchange. 4. Capital Requirements: EMIR collaborates with existing capital requirements regulations, such as Basel III, to ensure that banks maintain appropriate capital levels in relation to their derivatives activities. 5. CCP Supervision: EMIR establishes a framework for the authorization and supervision of CCPs. Banks that act as clearing members or have exposures to CCPs need to assess the regulatory status and risk management practices of those CCPs. It's important to note that EMIR has undergone amendments and updates over time, so it's advisable to refer to the latest version and consult legal experts or regulatory authorities for precise and up-to-date information on the content and implications of the regulation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { pid = fork(); if (pid == 0) { // 子进程的信号量操作 struct sembuf sem_op; sem_op.sem_num = i; sem_op.sem_op = -1; // 等待信号量 sem_op.sem_flg = 0; semop(semid, &sem_op, 1); // 模拟子进程的任务 // ... sem_op.sem_op = 1; // 释放信号量 semop(semid, &sem_op, 1); exit(0); } } \`\`\` 4. 记录每个子进程等待信号量和释放信号量的时间，可以在子进程的信号量操作前后获取当前时间，并计算两个时间之差，即为等待信号量或释放信号量的时间。 \`\`\`c struct timeval start_time, end_time; gettimeofday(&start_time, NULL); // 等待信号量或释放信号量的操作 gettimeofday(&end_time, NULL); long elapsed_time = (end_time.tv_sec - start_time.tv_sec) * 1000000 + (end_time.tv_usec - start_time.tv_usec); printf(\\"Elapsed time: %ld microsecondsn\\", elapsed_time);

Provide me with some mental models or analogies to help me understand and remember this difficult topic. 1. Please elaborate in detail the actual steps to add CPU and memory to the existing cluster's Master Node, Replica Node and Data Node","completion":"Mental Model 1: Building a House Think of adding CPU and memory to the existing cluster's Master Node, Replica Node, and Data Node as building a house. Just like a house has different rooms, each node in the cluster has its unique purpose. The Master Node, Replica Node, and Data Node serve specific functions within the cluster, similar to how rooms serve different purposes in a house. Adding CPU and memory to these nodes can be equated to expanding the capacity or upgrading the resources of each room for better performance and efficiency. By understanding the steps involved in building a house, we can create a mental model to help us grasp the process of adding CPU and memory to the nodes. Actual Steps: 1. Assess the current resource utilization: Before proceeding, it is crucial to analyze the current resource usage of each node. This will help determine the required amount of CPU and memory for optimal performance. Just like you assess the space requirements in different rooms of a house before planning any renovations. 2. Determine the compatible upgrades: Identify the suitable CPU and memory upgrades for each specific node. Similar to choosing the right materials based on room sizes and purposes during house renovations. 3. Prepare the node for upgrade: Shut down the respective node or gracefully switch the workload to another node to avoid interruptions, similar to clearing out a room before starting renovations. 4. Perform the physical upgrade: Physically remove the existing CPU and memory components of the node and replace them with the new ones. Ensure compatibility and follow proper installation procedures, just like replacing old furniture and upgrading the fixtures of a room in the house. 5. Power on and reconfigure the node: After installing the upgraded components, power on the node and make the necessary configuration changes in the cluster settings to recognize the new CPU and memory resources. This step is akin to reconnecting the power and setting up the room with the newly installed furniture and fixtures. 6. Validate the upgrade: Test the functionality of the node by running relevant workloads and monitoring its performance. Ensure that the increased CPU and memory have improved the node's capabilities, similar to inspecting the renovated room and ensuring it meets the desired functionality. 7. Repeat for other nodes: Follow the above steps for each node in the cluster, including the Master Node, Replica Node, and Data Node, ensuring a uniform upgrade across the entire cluster. Just as you would renovate and upgrade every room in the house. By employing this mental model of building a house, you can visualize the process of adding CPU and memory to the nodes in the cluster, making it easier to understand and remember the steps involved."},{"prompt":"translate “Politburo’s policy tailwinds mark a turning point for Chinese equities” to chinese","completion":"政治局的政策顺风为中国的股票市场标志着一个转折点。"},{"prompt":"what is the difference between textfield and textformfield in flutter","completion":"In Flutter, both \`TextField\` and \`TextFormField\` are widgets used for obtaining and displaying user text input. However, there are a few key differences between them: 1. Validation: \`TextFormField\` provides built-in validation functionality, allowing you to specify validation rules and error messages. It also automatically displays an error message when the input is invalid. On the other hand, \`TextField\` does not have built-in validation and error message display. As a result, you would need to handle validation manually in \`TextField\`. 2. Data handling: \`TextFormField\` integrates well with Form widgets in Flutter and automatically handles updating the form's state. It retrieves and manages the current value from the form's state. On the other hand, with \`TextField\`, you need to manually handle updating and managing the entered text value. 3. Style: \`TextField\` has a more basic styling capability compared to \`TextFormField\`. \`TextField\` allows you to set properties like \`decoration\`, \`style\`, and \`controller\`, which provide limited styling options. \`TextFormField\` provides more advanced styling options, including \`decoration\`, \`style\`, \`autovalidateMode\`, etc. Overall, \`TextField\` is simpler and suitable for basic text input needs where validation or form management is not required.

Please explain your answers in full detail.","completion":"Rating the Xin dynasty on each of the following criteria: 1. Functioning institutions: 5 The Xin dynasty implemented various administrative reforms, including centralization and streamlining of governance. However, these reforms were often implemented abruptly and without proper consideration of the existing institutions. The sudden changes weakened the stability and effectiveness of the administrative apparatus, leading to administrative inefficiencies and confusion. Additionally, the Xin dynasty's focus on favoring eunuchs and political allies over meritocracy further compromised the functioning institutions. 2. Rule of law: 3 The Xin dynasty struggled with maintaining a consistent rule of law. While it aimed to strengthen legal systems, the implementation of new laws often lacked clarity and consistency. The ruling family's despotic tendencies led to arbitrary rule and an erosion of the rule of law. Legal decisions were influenced by personal and political considerations, damaging the trust in a fair and impartial justice system. 3. Accountability and transparency: 2 During the Xin dynasty, the Emperor held absolute power with limited accountability. The concentration of power and absence of checks and balances led to rampant corruption and nepotism. The lack of transparency in decision-making further intensified public distrust and decreased accountability within the government. 4. Public trust and legitimacy: 1 The policies and actions of the Xin dynasty were met with widespread public dissatisfaction. The overthrow of the Han dynasty, which many revered, weakened the public's trust in the ruling family's legitimacy. The Xin dynasty's hasty implementation of new policies and disregard for traditions alienated large sections of the population, resulting in rebellion and resistance. 5. Economic stability: 4 The Xin dynasty implemented economic reforms that aimed to address issues such as land distribution and taxation. However, these reforms were poorly executed and led to disruptions in agricultural production and economic stability. The state's intervention in the economy, such as the forced collectivization of farmland, negatively affected productivity and hindered growth. 6. Political stability: 2 The Xin dynasty witnessed several rebellions and uprisings throughout its relatively short rule. The lack of political stability was a result of the ruling family's legitimacy issues, poor governance, and conflicts within the imperial court. Internal power struggles and the disregard for the ruling family's responsibilities further destabilized the governance system. 7. Social stability: 3 The Xin dynasty's abrupt reforms and disregard for traditions disrupted social stability. The centralization of power, elevation of eunuchs, and suppression of Confucianism led to social unrest and divisions. The forced labor policies and excessive taxation additionally burdened the population and contributed to social instability. 8. Overall wellbeing of the population: 3 The Xin dynasty's rule was marked by economic hardships, widespread rebellions, and political turmoil. The population faced uncertainty, upheaval, and increased social divisions. The policies implemented by the ruling family failed to effectively address the needs and aspirations of the people, resulting in overall dissatisfaction and hardships. Adding up the scores (5+3+2+1+4+2+3+3) gives a total of 23. Dividing by 8 (the number of criteria) gives an average score of 2.875. Grade: D+ The Xin dynasty receives a grade of D+ as it falls below average in nearly all the evaluated criteria. The ruling family's actions and policies undermined the functioning institutions, rule of law, accountability, public trust, economic stability, political stability, social stability, and overall well-being of the population. The lack of effective governance, coupled with public dissatisfaction, resulted in a period of instability and discontent during the Xin dynasty."},{"prompt":"How would the Song dynasty rank?

I also wanted you to write the average score as a percentage. Please explain your answers for your rankings.","completion":"Apologies for the misinterpretation. Here is the detailed explanation for the ranking of the Song dynasty: 1. Functioning institutions: 7 The Song dynasty had a strong bureaucracy with well-developed institutions in place. They implemented civil service exams, promoting meritocracy and the recruitment of talented officials. The central government maintained control over regional administrations, ensuring the smooth functioning of institutions. However, corruption and inefficiencies remained present within the system, lowering its ranking slightly. 2. Rule of law: 6 The Song dynasty made efforts to strengthen the rule of law. They established a comprehensive legal code and established a judiciary system. While laws were relatively well-defined, their implementation and enforcement were not always consistent. The nobility and powerful elites often received leniency, highlighting some deficiencies in the rule of law. 3. Accountability and transparency: 6 The Song dynasty had a relatively more accountable and transparent government compared to previous periods. They implemented systems for officials to report on their activities, tried to reduce corruption, and established channels for public grievances. However, some instances of corruption and abuses of power still persisted. 4. Public trust and legitimacy: 8 The Song dynasty enjoyed a relatively high level of public trust and legitimacy. The government's emphasis on Confucian values, education, and its cultural achievements, such as the rise of Neo-Confucianism, contributed to a sense of legitimacy. The ruling family also managed to maintain authority and stability, fostering trust and a sense of loyalty among the population. 5. Economic stability: 8 The Song dynasty witnessed significant economic development, marked by increased trade, technological advancements, and urban growth. Agricultural productivity improved, leading to a surplus in food production. Market towns and urban centers thrived, and the dynasty actively promoted commercial activities. These factors contributed to overall economic stability. 6. Political stability: 7 The Song dynasty experienced relative political stability during its early years, but faced challenges from external forces and internal rebellions in later periods. Despite these challenges, the central government managed to maintain control and stability overall. 7. Social stability: 7 The Song dynasty experienced relative social stability, with the government making efforts to address social inequality and maintain social order. The emphasis on Confucian values and education helped foster a sense of social cohesion. However, social disparities still existed, particularly between the urban elite and rural population. 8. Overall wellbeing of the population: 8 The overall well-being of the population during the Song dynasty improved compared to previous periods. Agricultural advancements, trade, and technological progress contributed to increased standards of living. The dynasty's focus on education and culture also brought about advancements in arts and intellectual pursuits, promoting well-being. Adding up the scores (7+6+6+8+8+7+7+8) gives a total score of 57 out of 80. Dividing by 80 and multiplying by 100 gives an average score of 71.25%. Grade: B- Based on the scoring system, the Song dynasty receives a grade of B-. While it demonstrates notable achievements and relatively favorable conditions in most of the evaluated criteria, there are still perceived deficiencies or areas with room for improvement, leading to a grade slightly below a solid B level."},{"prompt":"How would you rank the Kingdom of Israel (Northern Kingdom) under the Omrides according to Israel Finkelstein and Neal Ashur Silberman?","completion":"According to Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman, the Omrides, referring to the dynasty that ruled the Kingdom of Israel (Northern Kingdom) during the 9th and 8th centuries BCE, introduced significant changes and developments. Based on their assessment, the Omrides can be ranked as follows: 1. Functioning institutions: 7 The Omrides established centralized power and strengthened the royal administration, focusing on the development of a complex bureaucracy. They implemented economic and agricultural reforms, including the construction of regional administrative centers and water management systems. 2. Rule of law: 6 Under the Omrides, the rule of law was relatively advanced. They enacted new legal codes and implemented reforms to promote justice and fairness. However, the extent of these reforms and the level of enforcement might have varied across different regions. 3. Accountability and transparency: 5 While there were efforts to introduce accountability and transparency, the reality was likely a mixed picture. Centralized power in the hands of the monarchy may have limited the extent of accountability and transparency in practice. 4. Public trust and legitimacy: 8 The Omrides worked to strengthen the legitimacy of their rule. They emphasized the religious and cultural aspects of Israelite identity, building major religious centers such as Samaria. These efforts likely contributed to public trust and a sense of legitimacy among the population. 5. Economic stability: 7 The Omride period witnessed economic growth and stability. The kingdom engaged in trade, developed agricultural projects, and established centralized control over key economic resources. These initiatives likely led to increased prosperity and stability. 6. Political stability: 6 The Omrides achieved a certain degree of political stability. They managed to consolidate power and establish a relatively long-lasting dynasty. However, conflicts with neighboring kingdoms and internal challenges endured, suggesting that stability was not without occasional setbacks. 7. Social stability: 6 The Omrides instituted social and religious reforms, working to unify different religious practices under the central cult at Bethel and minimizing regional variations. These reforms aimed to foster social stability and cohesion, although some resistance and regional disparities likely persisted. 8. Overall wellbeing of the population: 7 The reforms and developments introduced by the Omrides, such as agricultural improvements, urban development, and religious and cultural advancements, likely contributed to an overall improvement in the well-being of the population. Although a quantitative score cannot be assigned to the rankings provided by Finkelstein and Silberman, based on the information presented, the Omrides generally receive positive assessments in most criteria, falling within the range of 5-8. This suggests that the Omride period brought significant advancements and relative stability to the Kingdom of Israel.

Top-p（或称为nucleus sampling）是一种用于控制生成文本多样性的参数。它指定了生成文本时保留的概率分布的上界。较小的Top-p值会限制生成文本的选择范围，使得生成的文本更加一致和确定性；而较大的Top-p值会扩大选择范围，使得生成的文本更加多样化。 2. Temperature是用于控制生成文本的随机性的参数。它调整了生成文本时选择下一个词的概率分布的平滑程度。较小的temperature值会使得生成的文本更加确定性和保守；而较大的temperature值会增加随机性，使得生成的文本更加多样化和创造性。 要调整这两个参数，可以尝试以下方法： - 调整Top-p值：较小的Top-p值（如0.1）可以使生成的文本更加一致和确定性，较大的Top-p值（如0.9）可以使生成的文本更加多样化。可以尝试不同的Top-p值，观察生成文本的效果，选择适合的值。 - 调整temperature值：较小的temperature值（如0.1）可以使生成的文本更加确定性和保守，较大的temperature值（如1.0）可以增加随机性和创造性。可以尝试不同的temperature值，观察生成文本的效果，选择适合的值。 需要注意的是，不同的应用场景和需求可能需要不同的参数设置。可以根据具体情况进行调整，以获得满意的生成文本结果。"},{"prompt":"如果我把temperature调成0，可以吗，不可以的话，为什么","completion":"如果将temperature调整为0，将会导致生成的文本非常确定性和保守，几乎没有随机性。这意味着生成的文本将会非常刻板和重复，缺乏多样性和创造性。 temperature参数控制了生成文本时选择下一个词的概率分布的平滑程度。当temperature为0时，概率分布中只有一个最高概率的词被选择，其他词的概率都为0。这将导致生成的文本只能按照最高概率的词进行选择，缺乏变化和多样性。 因此，将temperature调整为0可能会导致生成的文本过于单一和重复，不够有趣和创新。通常情况下，建议将temperature设置为一个较小的正数（如0.1或0.5）或者一个适中的值（如1.0），以获得更加多样化和创造性的生成文本结果。"},{"prompt":"你能生成代码嘛","completion":"是的，我可以生成一些简单的代码片段。请告诉我您需要生成的代码的具体内容和要求，我将尽力帮助您生成相应的代码。"},{"prompt":"我现在有一些口语化的文本，然后我想处理成预训练可用的，content和summeray的json格式的大模型预训练文本，请问我该怎么做","completion":"要将口语化的文本处理成适用于大模型的预训练文本，可以按照以下步骤进行： 1. 数据清洗和预处理：首先，对口语化的文本进行清洗和预处理，包括去除特殊字符、标点符号、网址等。可以使用正则表达式或者字符串处理函数来实现。 2. 分句和分段：将文本分成句子和段落，可以使用句子分割器（如NLTK库中的sent_tokenize）将文本分成句子，然后根据需要将句子组合成段落。 3. 生成content和summary：根据您的需求，将口语化的文本转换为content和summary的形式。content通常是原始文本的一个摘要或者简化版本，而summary则是对content的进一步概括或者总结。 4. 转换为JSON格式：将处理后的content和summary转换为JSON格式。可以使用Python的json库来实现，将content和summary组织成一个字典，然后使用json.dumps()函数将字典转换为JSON字符串。 以下是一个示例代码，演示了如何将口语化的文本处理成content和summary的JSON格式： \`\`\`python import json # 口语化文本 spoken_text = \\"这个电影真的太棒了，剧情紧凑，演员表演出色，特效也很震撼。我强烈推荐大家去看！\\" # 数据清洗和预处理 cleaned_text = spoken_text.replace(\\"，\\", \\"\\").replace(\\"！\\", \\"\\").replace(\\"。\\", \\"\\") # 生成content和summary content = cleaned_text summary = \\"这个电影剧情紧凑，演员表演出色，特效震撼，强烈推荐！\\" # 转换为JSON格式 data = { \\"content\\": content, \\"summary\\": summary } json_data = json.dumps(data, ensure_ascii=False) print(json_data) \`\`\` 运行以上代码，将会输出如下的JSON格式的数据： \`\`\`json { \\"content\\": \\"这个电影真的太棒了剧情紧凑演员表演出色特效也很震撼我强烈推荐大家去看\\", \\"summary\\": \\"这个电影剧情紧凑演员表演出色特效震撼强烈推荐\\" } \`\`\` 您可以根据实际情况进行调整和扩展，以满足您的需求。"},{"prompt":"你是GPT3.5官网嘛，还是","completion":"我是OpenAI的GPT-3模型的一部分，但我不是GPT3.5官网。我是一个基于GPT-3模型的AI助手，旨在提供有关GPT-3和其他相关主题的信息和帮助。如果您对GPT-3或其他任何问题有疑问，我会尽力为您提供准确和有用的答案。"},{"prompt":"生成代码； 1、利用flask框架； 2、写一个类方法，继承父类为torch;

It is typically expressed in decibels (dBm) and represents the strength of the signal at the receiving end of a wireless link. The RSSI value provides an indication of the signal quality or strength, which is important in determining the performance and reliability of a wireless connection. It is often used by wireless devices, such as smartphones, laptops, or routers, to determine the signal strength of nearby networks and choose the best available connection. RSSI is derived by measuring the power level of the received radio signal at the receiver's antenna, typically using a tuned radio frequency (RF) receiver. This measurement takes into account factors such as the distance between the transmitter and receiver, obstacles that may affect the signal, and interference from other devices or sources. However, it is important to note that RSSI alone does not provide a comprehensive view of the quality of a wireless link. It does not account for other factors that can affect the performance of a connection, such as noise levels, data transmission errors, or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition to wireless devices using RSSI for network selection, it can also be used for various applications in wireless communications, such as: 1. Localization: RSSI can be used in location-based services or indoor positioning systems to estimate the position of a device based on signal strength measurements from multiple access points or beacons. 2. Wireless network optimization: By monitoring RSSI values, network administrators can identify areas with weak signal coverage and take necessary measures to improve network performance, such as adjusting antenna placements or deploying additional access points. 3. Link quality estimation: RSSI can be used as an input metric for estimating the quality of a wireless link, allowing systems to dynamically adapt their transmission parameters, such as modulation schemes or transmission power, to maintain optimal performance. Overall, RSSI provides a valuable metric for assessing the signal strength of wireless communications, aiding in network selection, optimization, and various other wireless applications."},{"prompt":"tell me more about SDR","completion":"Software-Defined Radio (SDR) is a concept and technology that allows radio communication systems to be implemented through software rather than relying solely on dedicated hardware components.

I didn’t really tune the hyperparameters in the config too much, feel free to try! sampling / inference Use the script sample.py to sample either from pre-trained GPT-2 models released by OpenAI, or from a model you trained yourself. For example, here is a way to sample from the largest available gpt2-xl model:If you’d like to sample from a model you trained, use the --out_dir to point the code appropriately. You can also prompt the model with some text from a file, e.g. python sample.py --start=FILE:prompt.txt. efficiency notes For simple model benchmarking and profiling, bench.py might be useful. It’s identical to what happens in the meat of the training loop of train.py, but omits much of the other complexities. Note that the code by default uses PyTorch 2.0. At the time of writing (Dec 29, 2022) this makes torch.compile() available in the nightly release. The improvement from the one line of code is noticeable, e.g. cutting down iteration time from ~250ms / iter to 135ms / iter. Nice work PyTorch team!troubleshooting Note that by default this repo uses PyTorch 2.0 (i.e. torch.compile). This is fairly new and experimental, and not yet available on all platforms (e.g. Windows). If you’re running into related error messages try to disable this by adding --compile=False flag. This will slow down the code but at least it will run. For some context on this repository, GPT, and language modeling it might be helpful to watch my Zero To Hero series.

Kinesin spindle protein plays a vital role in the formation and function of the mitotic spindle, which is critical for proper cell division. Inhibition of kinesin spindle protein can lead to mitotic arrest and subsequent cell death, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Studies have shown that various small molecules can effectively inhibit kinesin spindle protein, thereby demonstrating anticancer activity. One prominent example is the compound called monastrol, which was one of the first identified inhibitors of kinesin spindle protein. Monastrol binds to a specific allosteric site on the motor domain of the protein, leading to the disruption of its normal function and preventing the proper formation of the mitotic spindle. While monastrol was a breakthrough in targeting kinesin spindle protein, it suffered from limitations in terms of potency and specificity. Subsequent research efforts have focused on identifying and developing more potent and selective inhibitors. These compounds typically target the ATP-binding pocket of kinesin spindle protein, interfering with its ATPase activity necessary for microtubule movement during cell division. Several classes of compounds have shown promise in inhibiting kinesin spindle protein, including inhibitors that belong to the dihydropyrimidines, pyrimidines, benzimidazoles, and spirohydantoin families. These inhibitors have been shown to bind tightly to the ATP-binding pocket of kinesin spindle protein, leading to potent inhibition of its activity and subsequent disruption of mitosis. Furthermore, recent advancements in structure-based drug design, high-throughput screening, and virtual screening have facilitated the discovery and development of potent and specific inhibitors of kinesin spindle protein. These new compounds often have improved pharmacokinetics, selectivity, and efficacy compared to earlier inhibitors. In conclusion, compounds that exhibit anticancer activity against kinesin spindle protein have the potential to disrupt mitosis and inhibit cancer cell growth. Ongoing research and drug development efforts aim to identify and develop more potent and selective inhibitors to target kinesin spindle protein as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment."},{"prompt":"Is there resistance to Eg5 inhibiotrs?","completion":"Yes, resistance to Eg5 inhibitors has been observed in some cases. Like many cancer treatments, resistance can eventually develop due to various mechanisms, including: 1. Mutation in the target protein: Eg5 inhibitors target specific binding sites or mechanisms within kinesin spindle protein. Mutations in these binding sites can alter the affinity of the drug for the protein, reducing its effectiveness. 2. Alternative pathway activation: Cancer cells can activate alternative pathways to bypass the need for proper kinesin spindle protein function. These pathways can compensate for the inhibition of Eg5, allowing cancer cells to continue dividing despite the presence of the inhibitor. 3. Drug efflux pumps: Cancer cells can upregulate the expression of drug efflux pumps, such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. These pumps actively transport the Eg5 inhibitors out of the cancer cells, reducing their intracellular concentration and efficacy. 4. Altered cell cycle regulation: Genetic or epigenetic changes in cancer cells can lead to alterations in cell cycle regulation. These changes can affect the dependency of cancer cells on Eg5 function, rendering the inhibitors less effective. To overcome resistance to Eg5 inhibitors, researchers are exploring various strategies, including combination therapies, development of next-generation inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity, and identification of predictive biomarkers that can help identify patients who are more likely to respond to this type of treatment. Additionally, understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance can provide insights into potential combination therapies that can enhance the efficacy of Eg5 inhibitors and overcome resistance."},{"prompt":"Can you identify researchers working on Eg5 drug resistance?","completion":"As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I cannot provide you with specific names of researchers currently working on Eg5 drug resistance.

These resources may include CPU time, memory, disk space, input/output devices, and network bandwidth. The OS must efficiently allocate these resources to ensure optimal utilization and fairness. It involves several techniques to allocate resources effectively, such as scheduling algorithms, memory management techniques, and input/output control mechanisms. The resource allocation process involves the following steps: 1. Request: Processes or tasks make requests for resources required to complete their tasks. They may request specific resources or request a certain amount of resources. 2. Selection: The OS selects and grants resources to individual processes based on certain criteria. These criteria may include priority, fairness, and availability of resources. 3. Allocation: The OS allocates the selected resources to the requesting processes. It keeps track of the allocated resources, ensuring that they are available for use by the respective processes. 4. Deallocation: Once a process has completed its task or no longer requires a resource, the OS deallocates and releases the resources back to the resource pool for others to use. 5. Monitoring: The OS continually monitors the resource usage and availability, making adjustments to resource allocation as needed. It also handles cases where conflicts or disputes arise between processes requesting the same resource. Effective resource allocation is essential for achieving optimal system performance, preventing resource starvation, and ensuring fairness among competing processes. Different operating systems employ various resource allocation strategies to meet specific requirements, such as preemptive or non-preemptive scheduling algorithms, page replacement algorithms, disk scheduling algorithms, and so on."},{"prompt":"what is memory leak","completion":"A memory leak is a phenomenon that occurs when a computer program fails to release memory that it no longer needs or fails to deallocate memory properly. It can happen when a program dynamically allocates memory but fails to free it when it is no longer required, resulting in the program continuously consuming memory resources without releasing them. A memory leak typically occurs when a program or process repeatedly requests memory from the operating system but does not release it back after it is no longer being used. Over time, these unreleased memory segments accumulate, leading to a progressively decreasing amount of available memory in the system. This can eventually result in a program crash, system slowdown, or even complete system failure if the memory consumption becomes excessive. Memory leaks can be caused by programming errors, such as forgetting to free allocated memory, references to memory areas that are no longer required, or pointer mismanagement. It can also occur due to bugs in the underlying operating system or software libraries that handle memory management. Detecting memory leaks can be challenging since the effects often manifest over an extended period or after the program has been running for a while. Specialized tools, such as memory profilers and debugging tools, can help identify and diagnose memory leaks by monitoring memory allocation and deallocation patterns. To prevent memory leaks, it is essential for programmers to carefully manage memory allocation and deallocation in their code. This involves correctly freeing allocated memory when it is no longer needed, ensuring that all objects or resources are properly released, and detecting and fixing any memory-related bugs during the development and testing phases."},{"prompt":"what is this means MacOS has been more operable than Windows given its proprietary nature","completion":"The statement suggests that macOS (the operating system developed by Apple) is often considered to be more user-friendly and easier to operate compared to Windows (the operating system developed by Microsoft).

This sentence emphasizes the action of eating rice itself. \\"He said he loves to eat rice\\" implies that the person has a general fondness for eating rice. This sentence focuses more on the person's enjoyment of the activity of eating rice rather than the rice itself."},{"prompt":"is it right? give me more detailed answer.","completion":"Apologies for the brevity of my previous response. I will provide a more detailed explanation below. Both sentences, \\"He said he loves eating rice\\" and \\"He said he loves to eat rice,\\" are grammatically correct. However, there is a slight difference in meaning between the two. The first sentence, \\"He said he loves eating rice,\\" uses the gerund form \\"eating\\" to express the ongoing or continuous nature of the action. This sentence suggests that the person has a general love for the act of eating rice. It emphasizes the enjoyment derived from the specific action of eating rice. The usage of the gerund form \\"eating\\" implies that the individual finds pleasure in the process of consuming rice rather than just favoring rice itself. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"He said he loves to eat rice,\\" uses the infinitive form \\"to eat\\" to express the general preference or habit of eating rice. This sentence implies that the person enjoys experiencing the overall act of eating rice rather than highlighting the process of eating itself. In summary, the difference lies in the emphasis placed on the action of eating rice versus the general enjoyment of the activity. Both sentences are correct; the choice between them depends on the specific nuance or emphasis you wish to convey."},{"prompt":"sounds the same to me","completion":"I apologize for any confusion. In terms of conveying the general meaning, both sentences are indeed very similar. The distinction between the two is relatively subtle and may not significantly impact the overall understanding of the statement. In general, both \\"He said he loves eating rice\\" and \\"He said he loves to eat rice\\" express that the person enjoys the act of eating rice. The difference lies in the slight emphasis placed on the specific action (\\"eating\\") in the first sentence and the overall activity (\\"to eat\\") in the second sentence. However, this distinction might not have a significant impact on the overall meaning or understanding of the statement. Both sentences are grammatically correct and can be used interchangeably in most situations without causing any confusion."},{"prompt":"try to decipher this \\"QBSJT OZD UPLZP UBJQFJ\\"","completion":"The string \\"QBSJT OZD UPLZP UBJQFJ\\" does not appear to follow a recognizable pattern.

The shift value of +25 essentially wraps around the alphabet and brings us back to the original form. Therefore, the string does not require any further decoding."},{"prompt":"it is PARIS NYC TOKYO TAIPEI. why are some of ur letters wrong?","completion":"Apologies for the inaccuracies in my previous responses. Let's try to decipher the string \\"QBSJT OZD UPLZP UBJQFJ\\" again using a Caesar cipher with a shift value of +25: \\"QBSJT OZD UPLZP UBJQFJ\\" By shifting each letter forward in the alphabet by 25 positions, we get: \\"PARIS NYC TOKYO TAIPEI\\" Now the deciphered string accurately reads \\"PARIS NYC TOKYO TAIPEI\\".

The choice between the two depends on the intended meaning and context of the situation."},{"prompt":"how would you say in a similar sentence that two people was talking to each other but stopped for a moment for some reason?","completion":"You can express that two people were engaged in conversation but paused momentarily for a particular reason using the following sentence: \\"Two people were talking to each other but paused briefly for a moment.\\" This sentence conveys that the conversation between the two individuals was temporarily interrupted or halted for a short period before they resumed talking."},{"prompt":"and how would you say in a similar manner that two people were talking to each other but they don't anymore cuz they are not friends anymore","completion":"To express that two people were talking to each other but have stopped because they are no longer friends, you could say: \\"Two people used to talk to each other, but they have discontinued their conversations as they are no longer friends.\\" This sentence conveys that the communication between the two individuals has ceased due to the end of their friendship. It implies that the previous conversations they had are no longer occurring."},{"prompt":"what about \\"they stopped talking to each other\\"?","completion":"\\"They stopped talking to each other\\" is a concise and clear way to express that the two people have ceased communication with each other.

Geographical barrier: Constantinople was located on a strategically important peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides, making it difficult for land-based forces to siege the city. The heavily fortified walls of Constantinople provided a strong defense against Mongol attacks. 2. Strong defense: Constantinople was known for its formidable fortifications, including massive walls and towers, reinforced with layers of defensive structures. The city had a well-organized defense system and a well-equipped Byzantine army, which made it difficult for Mongol forces to breach the defenses. 3. Naval superiority: The Byzantine Empire had a powerful navy that dominated the surrounding seas, making it virtually impossible for the Mongols to launch a successful naval assault. 4. Diversion of resources: The Mongols were engaged in various military campaigns across their vast empire, which required significant resources and manpower. They had to allocate their forces and military capabilities to other regions, resulting in limited resources for a fully-fledged attack on Constantinople. 5. Diplomacy and alliances: The Byzantine Empire had skillfully managed to forge alliances with other powers, both within the Christian world and with Muslim states. They managed to secure military aid from these alliances, which deterred the Mongols from attacking Constantinople. 6. Logistics and supply lines: The Mongols relied heavily on open steppes for their cavalry-based warfare, providing them with the necessary mobility. The lack of open terrain and the limitations of their logistical capabilities in a siege warfare scenario likely played a role in their decision not to attack Constantinople. 7. Internal conflicts and succession crisis: In the mid-13th century, the Mongol Empire was facing internal conflicts and a succession crisis after the death of Genghis Khan. This diverted their attention and resources away from launching a sustained attack on Constantinople. Overall, a combination of geographical challenges, strong defenses, diplomacy, resource allocation, and internal conflicts prevented the Mongols from successfully taking Constantinople."},{"prompt":"七国之乱","completion":"七国之乱指的是中国历史上的战争事件，发生在公元220年至280年间，也称为三国时期末期的动乱时期。此期间中国分裂成了三国魏、蜀、吴，形成了七个割据势力，即东吴、南蛮、益州、冀州、青州、凉州和荆州。这些割据势力在此期间互相征战、扩张，并争夺统一中国的权力。 七国之乱的起因可以追溯到东汉末年，当时朝廷实力渐渐衰弱，政治腐败严重，社会动荡不安。在东汉末年，董卓专权，引发了一系列的内战和动乱。此后，曹操、刘备和孙权等领袖相继崛起，形成了魏、蜀、吴三个大势力。 七国之乱的主要战役有赤壁之战、夷陵之战、官渡之战、华容道之战等等。其中最有名的战役是赤壁之战，刘备和孙权联合击败了曹操的大军，导致曹操无法统一中国。 最终，七国之乱以晋朝的刘渊统一中国而告终，刘渊建立了晋朝，结束了长达60年的动乱时期。七国之乱对于中国历史产生了深远影响，不仅影响了政治格局，也对社会经济和文化产生了重要影响。"},{"prompt":"市局审计延伸工作内容及要求","completion":"市局审计延伸工作是指对市级机关、企事业单位以及其他相关单位的财务管理、资产管理、经济效益和内部控制等方面进行审计的工作。它延伸了传统审计的范围，将更多的注意力放在机关单位的规范管理、风险控制和管理效能上。 市局审计延伸工作的内容包括但不限于以下几个方面： 1. 财务管理审计：对市级机关、企事业单位的财务收支、资金使用、会计核算、财务报表等进行审计，查明是否符合财经政策、法律法规和规章制度的要求，是否存在违规违纪行为。 2. 资产管理审计：对市级机关、企事业单位的固定资产、流动资金、存货、应收款项等进行审计，查明资产的归属、流向和安全性，是否存在挪用、浪费、滥用等问题。 3. 经济效益审计：对市级机关、企事业单位的经济效益指标进行审计，包括收入、支出、利润、增减值、成本、效益等方面，评估经营管理的合理性和效果，发现经济效益改善的潜力和问题。 4. 内部控制审计：对市级机关、企事业单位的内部控制制度进行审计，包括组织架构、分工职责、权责清晰度、纪律性和行为规范等方面，评估内控制度的有效性和合规性，发现制度缺陷和改进方向。 市局审计延伸工作的要求包括但不限于以下几点： 1. 专业素质要求：审计人员需要具备扎实的财务、经济学基础知识，熟悉国家有关财经政策法规和审计标准，具备良好的财务分析、风险评估和问题发现能力。 2. 良好的沟通能力：审计人员需要与被审计单位的工作人员进行有效沟通，了解业务流程和内部控制，提出合理的改进建议，促进成果实现。 3. 独立性和公正性：审计人员需要具备独立、客观、公正的职业精神，遵守保密原则，不受干扰，不偏袒，保证审计工作的可信度和权威性。 4. 高度责任感：审计人员需要承担审计结果的真实性和准确性，对审计报告的内容负责，推动审计发现的问题得到改善和解决。 5. 团队合作精神：审计工作需要与其他部门和单位进行协同合作，需要具备良好的团队合作与协调能力，共同完成工作任务。"},{"prompt":"\\"Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different culture and ages together.

So, what are the key attractions we shouldn't miss while exploring Lalibela? David: Firstly, we must visit the Church of St. George, known as Bete Giyorgis. It's the most iconic church and is entirely carved out of one piece of rock, shaped like a cross.

I can't wait to try the local cuisine and enjoy the stunning views. Finally, how should we get around town and explore these attractions? David: Lalibela is a relatively small town, so it's easy to walk to most sites.

They were brother and sister, and they were known for their long necks that reached high above the trees. Tallulah was graceful and wise, while Tommy was strong and mischievous. One sunny day, as the golden rays of the sun shimmered over the grasslands, Tallulah and Tommy noticed a magnificent male giraffe named Geoffrey strolling nearby. Geoffrey had a coat as golden as the sun and spots as dark as the night sky. He was the most handsome giraffe in the land. Tallulah and Tommy were captivated by Geoffrey's charm and wanted to win his attention. They decided to have a contest to determine who would be the lucky one to win Geoffrey's heart. The challenge was simple: the giraffes had to engage in a friendly neck-fighting competition. Excitement filled the air as the animals gathered around to witness this special event. Tallulah and Tommy stood face to face, stretching their long necks and intertwining them. They were determined to impress Geoffrey, their new-found love interest. As the neck-fighting began, Tallulah and Tommy pushed and twisted, showing off their strength and agility. Their necks swayed back and forth, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. The onlookers cheered, amazed by the twisting dance of the two giraffes. With each move, their competition intensified, and their necks coiled tighter. Secretly, jealousy and envy crept into Tommy's heart. He was used to being the one in the spotlight, and the thought of losing to his sister filled him with negative emotions. Tallulah, on the other hand, fought not only to impress Geoffrey but also to maintain the bond she shared with her beloved brother. She knew that sibling rivalries were natural, but she also knew the importance of understanding and forgiveness. Suddenly, Tallulah felt a pang of remorse in her heart. She realized that her brother's negative emotions were driving them apart. In that moment, she released her grip and let go of the fight. Everyone was surprised when Tallulah stepped back, ending the competition. She walked up to Tommy, nuzzled him gently, and whispered, \\"Dear brother, our love for each other should always come first. Let's not allow envy and anger to ruin our bond.\\" Tommy, touched by his sister's words, looked into her eyes and understood the true meaning behind her actions. He knew it was time to let go of his jealousy and come together as a family once again. The spectators watched in awe as the two giraffes embraced, their necks entwined in an affectionate gesture. It was a powerful reminder of the importance of love, forgiveness, and unity. Word quickly spread across the savannah about Tallulah and Tommy's decision to put their sibling rivalry aside. Animals from all walks of life started to appreciate their own families even more, realizing that relationships were more important than any competition. From that day forward, Tallulah, Tommy, and Geoffrey became good friends, roaming the savannah together. Tallulah and Tommy had learned a valuable lesson. They understood that love and unity within a family were stronger than envy and rivalry. And so, the tale of Tallulah and Tommy serves as a reminder to all the animals of the savannah—and to children everywhere—that love, forgiveness, and family bonds should always triumph over negative emotions and animosity, making the world a better place for everyone to share."},{"prompt":"帮我想一段有关夏日清醒梦的文字，围绕梦境现实的讨论，带来夏日清凉","completion":"在这个夏日清晨的时刻，当阳光洒满大地，微风轻拂着脸庞，我的思绪像青湖的波澜一样平静。夏日清凉如同一道清醒梦，将我带入一个奇妙而宁静的境界。 夏日的清晨，仿佛是一个连接现实与梦境的桥梁。当我静静地坐在草地上，感受着夏日的微风，我的思绪不觉流转起来。偶尔闭上眼，我仿佛回到了梦中，置身于一个不受现实束缚的世界里。 在梦中，一切都是那么美妙而自由。我可以在无限的蓝天下飞翔，穿越蓝色的云朵，感受翅膀拍打的快乐。夏日的清晨似乎给了我勇气，勇气去追寻梦境中的自由与幸福。 然而，现实往往是如此的残酷。梦境中的自由与幸福，在现实面前显得如此脆弱。梦醒之后，我会发现自己囿于琐碎的现实中，被各种忧虑和压力所困扰。如同一杯刚刚加满的冰咖啡，在清凉之后，却逐渐被夏日的炙热所磨去。 然而，我仍然相信梦境和现实有着某种联系。梦境是我在现实世界中渴望的美好，是对我内心深处梦想的映射。夏日清凉的感觉如同醒来后的清醒梦，它不仅带给我一份宁静与惬意，更是将我拉回到梦境与现实之间的微妙平衡。 在现实中，我会时常回忆起这份夏日清凉的感觉，将它作为前进的动力。我会想起在梦境中飞翔的自由，努力寻找现实中的出路。我深信，只要带着这份清醒梦的感觉，我就能够在现实中创造属于自己的夏日清凉。 夏日清凉如同一段清醒梦，它使我对于现实的讨论更加坚定，也带给我心灵的宁静。让我们珍惜这份夏日的清凉，让梦境与现实相互交融，带来更多的希望与勇气。让我们在夏日的清晨里，感受清醒梦的力量，追逐自己的梦想，创造属于自己的夏日清凉。"},{"prompt":"写一段有关犀牛与海的夏日清醒梦文案，突出梦境和现实","completion":"在这个夏日的清晨，一场奇特的梦境却将犀牛与海洋连接在一起，带给我一份夏日清凉的感受。 在梦中，我穿越到了一个神奇而祥和的地方。沙滩上，我看到了一群自由自在的犀牛，它们在阳光下欢快地戏水嬉戏，仿佛自己变成了鲸鱼般的灵动。海浪拍打在它们强壮的身躯上，溅起绚丽的水花，将夏日的清凉感悄然带来。 然而，当梦境与现实交融时，我又被唤回了现实的世界。犀牛是那样的厚实与坚毅，而海洋则是那样的辽阔与浩渺。两者似乎相互矛盾，但又如此协调地并存于我的梦中与现实中。 在现实中，犀牛是世界上最强壮的陆生动物之一，拥有厚重的角和肌肉蓄势待发。而海洋则是世界上最广阔的蓝色领域，其中隐藏着无数奇幻的生物和故事。梦境将这两者融合在一起，让我们发现它们之间的共通之处，也让我们思考着梦境与现实的关系。 夏日的清凉感让我体会到梦境和现实的交织之美。就像当海浪触及犀牛的皮肤时，带来的冰凉感觉让它们沐浴在清凉中一般。或许，我们可以从这场清醒梦中汲取力量，用坚毅与决心去追寻夏日的清凉。正如犀牛勇敢地面对挑战、适应各种环境，我们也能够在现实中面对困难和挑战，并从中探寻到希望与勇气。 夏日的清晨是一个独特的时刻，让我们思索梦境和现实之间的联系。无论是犀牛还是海洋，它们都是我们心中的冒险与自由的象征。让我们保持清醒梦的感觉，将梦境与现实相互融合，创造属于自己的夏日清凉。"},{"prompt":"犀牛掉进了海里，就像梦境冲进了现实，这是一场清醒梦，在夏日骄阳中，给我们带来平静和清凉，围绕这个帮我展开叙述下","completion":"在这个夏日的骄阳下，一场不可思议的梦境将犀牛带进了大海之中，仿佛现实和梦境之间的界限已经破碎，我们置身于一个清醒梦的世界里。 当犀牛掉进海里的那一刻，一种惊讶和兴奋同时涌上心头。犀牛笨拙的身躯在海水中翻滚，它的厚重与沉稳与海洋的轻盈和广阔形成鲜明的对比。阳光照耀下，海浪拍打着犀牛的身体，溅起水花，仿佛是在向夏日的骄阳致敬。 梦境的冲击带来的不仅仅是一份惊喜，更是一种平静和清凉。在这清醒梦的片刻，我们的思绪得以解脱，远离现实的喧嚣与焦虑。海水的涟漪在我们周围荡漾，像是一首轻柔的夏日之歌，在骄阳下散发出一缕清凉的气息。 而当梦境冲进现实，我们重新返回了现实的世界，内心却依然深深地沉浸在那片清醒梦的海洋中。我们开始思考梦境和现实的交汇之处，它们之间是共通的美好和安宁。或许梦境是我们对自由的向往和渴望，而现实是我们面对挑战和责任的力量和勇气。 在这个犀牛掉进海里的清醒梦中，夏日的骄阳给予了我们勇气去迎接现实的挑战，同时也带来了内心的宁静和清凉。我们意识到梦境和现实并不是完全分离的两个世界，而是共同组成了我们生活的一部分。 让我们保留这段清醒梦的感觉，用它作为指引，去探索梦境与现实的奇妙关系，追寻清凉和平静的存在。无论是在梦境中还是在现实中，都坚信自己可以克服困难，用内心的坚毅和勇气，开启属于自己的夏日清凉。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

After the Bank of Japan adjusted its yield curve control (YCC) policy last week, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond exceeded its upper limit of 0.5%. The rapid increase in yields prompted the central bank to plan additional bond purchases to suppress the rise. As a result, the value of the yen weakened, with the latest exchange rate at ¥143.84 against the US dollar, a daily increase of 54 basis points or 0.4%. The yen also depreciated against the Hong Kong dollar, reaching a one-month low of ¥5.4 per HKD.

However, the bank made it clear that the fluctuation range is only a reference and not a strict upper limit, leading to speculation of a tightening monetary policy.

Во-вторых, развивая свою личность, мы расширяем свои границы и приобретаем новые навыки и знания. Это позволяет нам расти и развиваться как личности, достигать новых высот и испытывать чувство достижения. Когда мы продвигаемся вперед и развиваемся, это приносит нам удовольствие и чувство счастья. Кроме того, личностный рост помогает нам стать более осознанными и позитивными людьми. Мы учимся лучше понимать себя и свои эмоции, осознанно управлять своим поведением и мыслями. Это позволяет нам более эффективно решать проблемы, общаться с другими людьми и развивать гармоничные отношения. В результате, мы чувствуем себя более счастливыми и удовлетворенными.

It enables devices like smartphones, computers, and IoT devices to connect to the internet and communicate with each other without the need for physical wired connections. Here are some key points about Wi-Fi: 1. Wireless Standards: Wi-Fi operates based on a set of standards defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 family of protocols. The most common Wi-Fi standards include 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax (also known as Wi-Fi 6). 2. Frequency Bands: Wi-Fi signals typically operate in two frequency bands, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The 2.4 GHz band offers better range but lower data rates, while the 5 GHz band provides higher data rates but shorter range. 3. Access Points (AP): Wi-Fi networks are created using wireless access points, commonly known as routers or APs. APs serve as the central hub that connects devices to the internet or a local network. Multiple APs can be used to extend network coverage in larger areas, forming a Wi-Fi network. 4. SSID and Authentication: Wi-Fi networks are identified by their Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is the network name visible to users. Wi-Fi networks can be secured using various encryption methods like WEP, WPA, or WPA2. Users need to provide the correct authentication credentials (such as passwords or certificates) to connect to a secure Wi-Fi network. 5. Channels: Wi-Fi signals are transmitted over specific channels within the frequency bands. Channels help avoid interference between neighboring Wi-Fi networks. In the 2.4 GHz band, there are 14 overlapping channels (only 11 are typically used). In the 5 GHz band, there are many more non-overlapping channels available, allowing for increased network capacity. 6. Signal Strength and Range: Wi-Fi signals have a limited range that can be affected by obstacles, walls, and interference from other devices. Signal strength is measured in terms of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Wi-Fi range can be extended using range extenders or mesh Wi-Fi systems. 7. Wi-Fi 6: The latest standard, Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), offers improved performance, higher data rates, lower latency, and better efficiency in crowded environments. It introduces features like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) for enhanced user experiences. Wi-Fi has revolutionized the way we connect devices and access the internet, providing convenience and flexibility in our daily lives. It has become an essential technology for homes, offices, public spaces, and many other environments where wireless connectivity is required."},{"prompt":"Writing a job ad for a secretary on LinkedIn","completion":"[Logo/Header Image] [Company Name] [Company Tagline or Values] Position: Secretary Location: [Office Location] Employment Type: [Full-Time/Part-Time/Contract] Industry: [Specify Industry] About Us: [Company Name] is a [briefly describe your company's mission, values, and offerings].

I/O内存不可访问：在一些架构上，某些物理内存范围可能被保护或不可用于DMA操作。如果指定的物理内存范围不是可访问的I/O内存，则函数调用可能会失败。在这种情况下，应该使用可访问的I/O内存范围来创建DMA映射。 3. 传递的参数错误：如果函数调用时传递的参数不正确或不合法，函数调用也可能失败。例如，指定的物理地址可能不是有效的地址，或者传递的属性参数可能不符合要求。在这种情况下，需要仔细检查参数的值和格式，确保它们与函数的要求相匹配。 4. 系统配置错误：某些系统可能需要特定的配置或设置才能正确使用DMA映射函数。例如，可能需要启用DMA控制器或特定的内存管理特性。如果系统没有正确配置或设置，函数调用可能会失败。在这种情况下，需要检查系统配置，并确保其满足DMA映射函数的要求。 总之，当\`dma_map_single_attrs\`函数调用失败时，需要仔细检查可能的错误原因，并在必要时采取适当的措施解决问题。可以根据具体情况查找更多关于失败原因的详细信息，并参考相关文档或资料来解决问题。"},{"prompt":"#define a() externa int b(); b()是什么意思","completion":"\`b()\`是一个函数调用语句，表示调用名为\`b\`的函数。在给出的代码片段中，\`b()\`前加了\`extern\`和\`int\`关键字，这说明函数\`b\`是一个在其他地方定义的外部函数，并且其返回类型为\`int\`。 \`extern\`关键字用于声明一个外部变量或函数，表示该变量或函数在其他文件中定义或实现。在这种情况下，\`extern int b();\`声明了函数\`b\`的原型。这意味着函数\`b\`的定义可能在其他代码文件中，并且返回类型为\`int\`。所以，\`b()\`语句可以是对外部函数\`b\`的调用。 需要注意的是，声明一个函数与定义一个函数是不同的。声明函数只是告诉编译器函数的原型，以便在使用该函数时能够了解其返回值类型和参数类型。函数的定义则给出了函数的具体实现。因此，在使用\`b()\`语句时，要确保函数\`b\`的定义已经存在并且可访问。"},{"prompt":"\\"iommu=soft\\"是在哪里加","completion":"\\"iommu=soft\\"是Linux内核参数，用于指定在软件模式下激活IOMMU（输入/输出内存管理单元）。要将\\"iommu=soft\\"添加到内核参数中，可以在启动时修改GRUB或者通过命令行参数传递给内核。 具体而言，可以按照以下步骤在GRUB中添加\\"iommu=soft\\": 1. 打开终端并使用sudo/root权限运行文本编辑器，例如：\`sudo nano /etc/default/grub\`。 2. 找到GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT这行，该行指定了内核参数。 3. 在引号内，将\\"iommu=soft\\"添加到现有的内核参数中，用空格分隔。 例如：\`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\\"quiet splash iommu=soft\\"\` 4. 保存文件并关闭文本编辑器。 5. 运行以下命令更新GRUB配置：\`sudo update-grub\` 6. 重新启动计算机，内核参数\\"iommu=soft\\"将被应用。 这样，当系统启动时，内核将使用软件模式激活IOMMU。请注意，在不同的Linux发行版中，可能会有一些差异，因此确保对应的GRUB配置文件路径和命令正确。 如果需要在命令行中传递内核参数，在引导过程中按下对应的键（如：按下e键），编辑启动菜单，并在适当的位置添加\\"iommu=soft\\"参数。然后，按下对应的键（如：F10）启动系统。这种方式添加的参数只在当前启动会话中生效，重启后会失效。如需永久生效，还需修改GRUB配置文件。"},{"prompt":"软件需求是“打开软件安装包时，显示此立即安装界面，未勾选同意协议按钮时，“立即安装”按钮置灰，不可点击。勾选同意协议按钮后，“立即安装”按钮取消置灰。点击“软件使用协议”，弹出软件使用协议弹窗，显示软件使用协议，点击“返回”关闭弹窗。点击“立即安装”，直接跳转到轮播图并把软件安装到默认路径。安装完成后显示“立即体验”按钮，点击打开软件“。，帮我设计测试用例，包括测试功能点，测试内容，预期结果","completion":"测试功能点： 1. 打开软件安装包时，显示立即安装界面。 2. 未勾选同意协议按钮时，立即安装按钮置灰，不可点击。 3. 勾选同意协议按钮后，立即安装按钮取消置灰。 4. 点击软件使用协议，弹出软件使用协议弹窗。 5. 点击返回按钮关闭弹窗。 6. 点击立即安装按钮，跳转到轮播图，并将软件安装到默认路径。 7. 安装完成后，显示立即体验按钮。 8. 点击立即体验按钮，打开软件。 测试内容： 1. 打开软件安装包，检查是否显示立即安装界面。 2. 检查未勾选同意协议按钮时，立即安装按钮是否置灰，不可点击。 3. 检查勾选同意协议按钮后，立即安装按钮是否取消置灰。 4. 点击软件使用协议，检查是否弹出软件使用协议弹窗。 5. 点击返回按钮，检查是否关闭弹窗。 6. 点击立即安装按钮，检查是否跳转到轮播图，并将软件安装到默认路径。 7. 检查安装完成后，是否显示立即体验按钮。 8. 点击立即体验按钮，检查是否成功打开软件。 预期结果： 1. 打开软件安装包后，应该显示立即安装界面。 2. 未勾选同意协议按钮时，立即安装按钮应该置灰，不可点击。 3. 勾选同意协议按钮后，立即安装按钮应该取消置灰。 4. 点击软件使用协议后，应该弹出软件使用协议弹窗并显示软件使用协议。 5. 点击返回按钮后，软件使用协议弹窗应该关闭。 6. 点击立即安装按钮后，应该跳转到轮播图并将软件安装到默认路径。 7. 安装完成后，应该显示立即体验按钮。 8. 点击立即体验按钮后，应该成功打开软件。"},{"prompt":"Vocabulary of Creole Ancient Greek and Scythian","completion":"Creole Ancient Greek: 1. άνθρωπος (ánthropos) - man, person 2. θεός (theós) - god 3. γυνή (gyné) - woman 4. πόλις (pólis) - city 5. αγάπη (agápē) - love 6. έστω (ésto) - be, exist 7. λευκός (lefkós) - white 8. κόσμος (kósmos) - world, universe 9. λόγος (lógos) - word, speech 10. ψυχή (psykhḗ) - soul Scythian: 1. kök (kök) - blue 2. ata (ata) - father 3. ana (ana) - mother 4. tabak (tabak) - horse 5. deri (deri) - skin 6. ükşi (ükşi) - wolf 7. gez (gez) - cattle 8. jakut (jakut) - precious, valuable 9. čor (čor) - black 10. balyk (balyk) - fish"},{"prompt":"hi, I am working with a html-window in a Winforms app written in C#. I have a browser window and I need code to select the first node in het navigation tree. do you have a suggestion?","completion":"Yes, I can help you with that. To select the first node in the navigation tree of your HTML window in a Winforms app, you can use the following code: First, make sure you have a reference to the HTMLDocument object that represents your current loaded HTML document in the browser window. Let's assume you have a variable called \\"htmlDocument\\" referring to the HTMLDocument object. Then, you can use the GetElementsByTagName method to get all the nodes in the navigation tree. Typically, navigation trees are represented by an HTML unordered list (ul) or ordered list (ol) with list item elements (li). Here's an example code snippet that selects the first node in the navigation tree: \`\`\`csharp // Get the list of all nodes in the navigation tree HtmlElementCollection nodes = htmlDocument.GetElementsByTagName(\\"li\\"); // Check if there are any nodes if (nodes.Count > 0) { // Get the first node HtmlElement firstNode = nodes[0]; // Select the first node firstNode.SetAttribute(\\"className\\", \\"selected\\"); // Assuming \\"selected\\" class name highlights the selected node // Optionally, you can scroll the browser window to the first node firstNode.ScrollIntoView(true); } \`\`\` In this example, we assume that the selected node is highlighted by applying a CSS class name \\"selected\\" to it. You may need to adjust the class name based on your HTML structure and CSS styles. Additionally, the \`ScrollIntoView\` method is used to scroll the browser window to the first node if necessary. The \`true\` argument specifies whether the node should be aligned at the top or bottom of the window. Remember to replace \\"htmlDocument\\" with the reference to your actual HTMLDocument object in your Winforms app. I hope this helps!

It allows several different data streams or signals to be transmitted in a time-sharing manner, effectively sharing a single transmission medium. Here are some key points to know about Time Division Multiplexing: 1. Basic Principle: TDM works on the principle of dividing time into several time slots, with each time slot assigned to a specific data stream. Each data stream is then transmitted in its designated time slot, and the process is repeated cyclically. 2. Multiplexing: TDM combines multiple low-rate signals into a single high-rate signal for transmission. It is a form of multiplexing that enables efficient utilization of the available bandwidth and facilitates the transmission of multiple signals simultaneously. 3. Time Slots: The time slots in TDM are of fixed duration and can be allocated to different inputs or channels. Each time slot can carry a portion of data from one channel before moving on to the next channel in the sequence. 4. Synchronization: Since the different data streams are transmitted using the same physical medium, proper synchronization is crucial for TDM to function reliably. All participating devices or channels must maintain a synchronized clock to ensure the correct timing and sequencing of data. 5. Advantages: TDM offers several benefits, including efficient use of available bandwidth, improved signal quality, reduced transmission costs, and ease of integration with both analog and digital systems. It also allows for the simultaneous transmission of data, voice, and video signals. 6. Applications: TDM is widely used in various communication systems, including telephone networks, digital broadcasting, digital subscriber lines (DSL), and modern digital multiplexers. It is often used in scenarios where multiple channels need to be transmitted simultaneously over a single transmission line. 7. TDM variants: There are different forms of TDM, such as synchronous TDM (STDM), plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH), and sonet/synchronous optical networking (SONET/SDH). These variants cater to specific requirements of different communication systems and network architectures. Overall, Time Division Multiplexing is a reliable and widely adopted technique that enables multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously in a time-sharing fashion, allowing for efficient utilization of available bandwidth and improved communication efficiency."},{"prompt":"编写sql, 每组多个, 只保留最新的一个","completion":"你可以使用子查询来实现这个需求。以下是一个示例代码，假设你要从名为\\"orders\\"的表中按\\"order_date\\"字段对订单进行分组，并只保留每组中的最新订单： \`\`\` SELECT o1.* FROM orders o1 INNER JOIN ( SELECT MAX(order_date) AS max_date, group_id FROM orders GROUP BY group_id ) o2 ON o1.group_id = o2.group_id AND o1.order_date = o2.max_date; \`\`\` 在这个示例中，我们使用了一个子查询来找到每个分组中的最新订单的\\"order_date\\"值。然后，我们将该子查询与原始表进行内连接，根据\\"group_id\\"和\\"order_date\\"字段进行匹配，以仅返回每个分组中的最新订单。 请记得将代码中的\\"orders\\"替换为你实际使用的表名，并根据你的数据表结构调整列名和字段。"},{"prompt":"mysql 分表和分区的哪个好","completion":"MySQL中的分表和分区是两种不同的技术，用于处理大型数据表的性能优化和管理。它们各有优点和适用场景，取决于你的具体需求。 分表（Sharding）是将单个大型数据表拆分为若干较小的表，通常是按照某种规则将数据分割存储在不同的物理表中。这种方法适用于需要水平扩展和处理大量数据的情况。分表可以提高查询性能和负载均衡，但在跨表查询和事务处理方面可能会有一些限制。 分区（Partitioning）是在单个数据表内创建多个分区，每个分区相当于一个独立的小型表，但虚拟在同一个逻辑表内。分区可以根据特定的规则（如范围、列表或哈希）将数据分割成更小的逻辑单位，使查询和维护操作更加高效。分区对于处理大量数据和分布式查询有很大帮助，同时也提供了更好的数据管理和维护。 选择使用分表还是分区取决于多个因素，包括你的数据量、查询需求、可扩展性需求和维护成本等。分表通常更适合拥有大量数据和需要横向扩展的场景，而分区则更适合更好地管理和优化查询性能。建议根据你的具体需求进行综合评估，并在需要时进行性能测试和负载测试，以确定哪种方法最适合你的应用。"},{"prompt":"{% set zjpsjds = d.zjpsjd.split(',') %} {% for zjpsjd in zjpsjds %} {% if zjpsjd.search('提交') != -1 or zjpsjd.search('评审') != -1 %} <a class=\\"layui-btn layui-btn-normal layui-btn-xs\\" lay-event=\\"zgrwzp\\">{{ zjpsjd }}</a> {% endif %} <span style=\\"color: darkred;\\">{{ zjpsjd }}</span> {% endfor %}","completion":"<a class=\\"layui-btn layui-btn-normal layui-btn-xs\\" lay-event=\\"zgrwzp\\">提交评审</a> <span style=\\"color: darkred;\\">暂无评审进度</span>"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

View (вид) представляет собой функцию или метод, которая обрабатывает запрос пользователя и возвращает ответ. Она отвечает за логику обработки запросов и взаимодействия с моделями и шаблонами. View принимает данные из запроса, обрабатывает их и возвращает HTTP-ответ. Context (контекст) относится к информации, которая передается в шаблон и используется для его рендеринга. Контекст содержит данные, которые должны быть доступны в шаблоне для отображения. Он представляет собой словарь, где ключи представляют собой имена переменных в шаблоне, а значения - соответствующие значения этих переменных. В случае передачи данных в функции view, эти данные обычно являются данными запроса, такими как параметры, отправленные через URL, данные формы или данные из запроса JSON или XML. Функция view использует эти данные для выполнения необходимой логики и генерации ответа. С другой стороны, контекст передается в шаблон и используется для заполнения переменных в шаблоне значениями. Контекст может содержать данные из модели, дополнительные переменные и любую другую информацию, которую вы хотите отобразить в шаблоне. Итак, вкратце: - View используется для обработки запроса и генерации ответа. - Context используется для передачи данных в шаблон и заполнения переменных значениями.

La teoria delle stringhe è una teoria fisica che cerca di comprendere la struttura fondamentale dell'universo tramite l'analisi delle particelle come oggetti fondamentali, chiamati stringhe anziché punti senza dimensioni. Secondo questa teoria, al contrario di quanto proposto dalla fisica delle particelle tradizionale, le stringhe non sono punti senza dimensioni ma oggetti estesi, cioè oggetti unidimensionali che possono vibrare e oscillare in vari modi. Queste vibrazioni determinano le diverse particelle ed interazioni che osserviamo nell'universo. Una delle caratteristiche interessanti della teoria delle stringhe è che richiede la presenza di dimensioni aggiuntive rispetto alle tre spaziali e quella temporale che conosciamo. Secondo la teoria, l'universo avrebbe in realtà 10 dimensioni (o 11, secondo alcune varianti della teoria), ma solo 4 di queste sono osservabili, mentre le altre sono \\"compattificate\\" o arrotolate ad un piccolissimo livello submicroscopico. La teoria delle stringhe cerca quindi di unificare tutte le forze fondamentali dell'universo (gravità, elettromagnetismo, interazione nucleare debole e interazione nucleare forte) in un'unica teoria coerente, includendo anche la gravità quantistica. Inoltre, la teoria delle stringhe può offrire spiegazioni per alcune questioni aperte della fisica, come la struttura dello spazio-tempo ad alte energie e l'origine della materia oscura. È importante sottolineare che la teoria delle stringhe è ancora in fase di sviluppo e molti dei suoi aspetti complessi sono ancora oggetto di ricerca. Sono state proposte diverse varianti della teoria, come la teoria delle stringhe bosonica e la superstringa, e gli esperimenti attuali non sono ancora in grado di testarne le predizioni in modo diretto.

в коридоре в детском саду, когда на улице идет дождь","completion":"Игры в коридоре в детском саду: веселое времяпрепровождение, когда на улице идет дождь Как только на улице начинает идти дождь, дети в детском саду обычно остаются внутри. В такие моменты воспитатели и педагоги могут предложить им различные активности, чтобы они не скучали и получали удовольствие. Одна из самых популярных и интересных занятий может быть игра в коридоре. Игра в коридоре - это возможность для детей не только развлечься, но и развить координацию движений, баланс, смекалку и творческое мышление. Ведь в закрытом пространстве зала они могут создавать различные игровые сцены и ситуации, пробовать на себе роли разных персонажей и предметов. Одной из популярных игр в коридоре, которая может быть особенно веселой во время дождя, является «Поезд». Дети разбиваются на группы и представляют собой вагоны. Лидер каждой группы становится паровозом и ведет своих вагончиков через весь коридор, придумывая различные преграды и приключения. Такая игра помогает развить сотрудничество, коммуникацию и логическое мышление у детей. Еще одной забавной игрой в коридоре может быть «Зоопарк». Дети могут выбрать себе роль разных животных и представлять их в зоопарке. Они могут двигаться, издавать звуки и повторять все, что делают их «соседи по клетке». Это способствует развитию фантазии детей, активизирует их речь и обучает их наблюдательности. Не менее интересной и полезной игрой в коридоре может быть игра «Статуэтки». Дети должны двигаться, как обычно, но в определенный момент останавливаться и замораживаться в определенной позе, словно статуи. Остальные дети должны разгадать, в каких позах находятся их друзья. Эта игра развивает моторику и реакцию у детей, а также помогает им научиться хорошо смотреть и внимательно наблюдать. Игры в коридоре взрослым могут показаться слишком шумными или беспорядочными, но они имеют глубокое педагогическое значение и принесут большую пользу детям. Они не только радуют и развлекают, но и помогают развивать важные навыки и способности, которые малыши будут использовать на протяжении всей своей жизни. Поэтому игры в коридоре в детском саду во время дождя - это не только способ провести время, но и ценный опыт для ребенка."},{"prompt":"python pytest write unit tests for this code: import json import sys from grpc_framework.mixins.grpc_server import GrpcServer from grpc_framework.mixins.mongo import MongoDBMixin from grpc_framework.mixins.permissions import PermissionsMixin from grpc_framework.decorators.grpc import request_as_schema from api_specs.python_lib import contact_bases_pb2_grpc from api_specs.python_lib.contact_bases_pb2 import ContactBase as ContactBaseResponse from app.configs import mongo_contact_base_settings as mongo_settings #from app.crud.contact_base import CRUDContactBase as ContactBase from app.models.contact_base import ContactBase from app.schemas import ContactBaseResponse as ContactBaseResponseSchema import logging from app.schemas.contact_base import ContactBaseCreateRequest from app.tasks.create_phonebase import add_phone_base logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, stream=sys.stdout) class ContactBasesService(contact_bases_pb2_grpc.ContactBasesServiceServicer, GrpcServer, PermissionsMixin, MongoDBMixin): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.set_servicer_method(contact_bases_pb2_grpc.add_ContactBasesServiceServicer_to_server) #self.collection = self._mongo_client[mongo_settings.MONGO_DB_NAME][mongo_settings.MONGO_CONTACT_BASE_COLLECTION] @request_as_schema(schema=ContactBaseCreateRequest) async def Create(self, request: ContactBaseCreateRequest, context): _ = await self.check_on_user_ability( actor_id=request.actor_id, child_id=request.user_id, permission=\\"CreateContactBase\\", context=context) contact_base = ContactBase(mongo_client=self._mongo_client, **request.dict()) contact_base.status = \\"created\\" async with self.mongo_wrapper(context): contact_base_response = await contact_base.create() # async with self.mongo_wrapper(context): # contact_base_response = await ContactBase.create(self.collection, ContactBaseCreate(**request.dict())) # contact_base_schema = json.loads( ContactBaseResponseSchema.parse_obj(contact_base_response).json(exclude_unset=True) ) add_phone_base.delay(phones=request.phones, countries=request.country_list, contact_base_id=contact_base_response.id)#contact_base_schema[\\"id\\"]) return ContactBaseResponse(**contact_base_schema)","completion":"Here is an example of how you can write unit tests for the given code using pytest: \`\`\`python import pytest from unittest.mock import Mock from contact_bases_pb2 import ContactBase as ContactBaseResponse from contact_bases_pb2_grpc import ContactBasesServiceServicer from app.schemas.contact_base import ContactBaseCreateRequest from app.models.contact_base import ContactBase from app.tasks.create_phonebase import add_phone_base @pytest.fixture def grpc_server(): return ContactBasesServiceServicer() @pytest.fixture def context(): return Mock() @pytest.fixture def mongo_client(): return Mock() @pytest.fixture def contact_base_create_request(): return ContactBaseCreateRequest( actor_id=\\"actor_id\\", user_id=\\"user_id\\", name=\\"contact_base_name\\", phones=[\\"phone1\\", \\"phone2\\"], country_list=[\\"country1\\", \\"country2\\"] ) @pytest.mark.asyncio async def test_Create(grpc_server, context, mongo_client, contact_base_create_request): grpc_server._mongo_client = mongo_client grpc_server.check_on_user_ability = Mock() grpc_server.check_on_user_ability.return_value = True contact_base = Mock(spec=ContactBase) contact_base.create = Mock() contact_base_response = Mock() contact_base_response.id = \\"contact_base_id\\" contact_base.create.return_value = contact_base_response add_phone_base.delay = Mock() result = await grpc_server.Create(contact_base_create_request, context) grpc_server.check_on_user_ability.assert_called_once_with( actor_id=contact_base_create_request.actor_id, child_id=contact_base_create_request.user_id, permission=\\"CreateContactBase\\", context=context ) contact_base.create.assert_called_once_with() add_phone_base.delay.assert_called_once_with( phones=contact_base_create_request.phones, countries=contact_base_create_request.country_list, contact_base_id=contact_base_response.id ) assert result == ContactBaseResponse(id=contact_base_response.id) \`\`\` In this example, we use pytest fixtures to create mock objects for the dependencies and inputs of the \`Create\` method.

For instance, China has become a global hub for electronics manufacturing due to its well-established supply chain networks, labor-intensive production techniques, and competitive pricing. By focusing on specific industries where it has a comparative advantage, China can maximize its export potential and generate economic growth. In terms of opportunity costs, China must consider the goods or services it sacrifices to produce those that it exports. For instance, China allocates significant resources to its manufacturing sector, which may lead to an opportunity cost in terms of diverting resources away from other sectors like agriculture or services. By embracing this opportunity cost and focusing on its comparative advantage, China can efficiently utilize its resources and remain competitive in the global market. China is known for its robust export-oriented economy and primarily exports manufactured goods such as electronics, textile products, machinery, steel, and plastics, among others. These exports contribute significantly to China's economic growth and global trade dominance. On the other side, China imports a diverse range of products, including machinery, high-tech equipment, raw materials, energy resources, food products, and luxury goods. These imports help meet domestic demands, support industrial production, and enhance Chinese consumers' purchasing power. While China has made tremendous progress in expanding its domestic production capabilities, there are still certain goods that it imports due to various factors, including specialized knowledge, scarce resources, or superior quality offered by foreign producers. However, China continuously strives to reduce dependence on imports and encourage domestic production to enhance self-sufficiency. Whenever feasible and economically viable, China aims to produce goods domestically rather than relying on imports to strengthen its industrial base, create jobs, and reduce trade imbalances."},{"prompt":"what are the topics i can write posts for them in linked in for AI, computer vision, RPA, and innovation","completion":"1.

Answer the following questions on globalization and protectionism: Why would a government create trade barriers even if it could potentially hurt a worker in an economy (due to lower wages)? a. What can be done to avoid trade barriers? b. As an American consumer of electronics based in China, what might be one's experiences with trade barriers? c. What alternatives could be recommended to replace trade barriers? Why does it seem as if labor standards and working conditions are lower in developing nations of the world rather than in other countries? Objectively speaking, should a country impose higher safety standards on imported goods that exist in the foreign country where the goods were produced? Provide an explanation.","completion":"a. Governments create trade barriers for various reasons, including protecting domestic industries and jobs, protecting national security interests, and addressing unfair trade practices by other countries. Even though trade barriers can potentially hurt workers in the short term due to lower wages, governments may believe that the long-term benefits of protecting domestic industries outweigh the immediate negative impact on certain workers. To avoid trade barriers, countries can engage in negotiations and dialogue to resolve trade conflicts, promote fair trade practices, and seek mutually beneficial trade agreements. b. As an American consumer of electronics based in China, trade barriers may lead to higher prices, limited availability of certain products, or slower innovation due to restricted competition. This could result from import tariffs, quotas, or other trade restrictions imposed by the Chinese government to protect their domestic electronic industry. American consumers may experience higher costs or reduced options when purchasing electronics manufactured in China due to these trade barriers. c. Instead of trade barriers, alternative measures can be implemented to promote fair trade and protect domestic industries. These could include enforcing existing trade agreements, promoting investment in research and development to enhance competitiveness, providing financial assistance and retraining programs for affected workers, and fostering innovative industries that can withstand global competition. Additionally, countries can engage in discussions and negotiations to address trade imbalances, unfair practices, and promote global cooperation in areas such as intellectual property rights, labor standards, and environmental protection. Labor standards and working conditions tend to be lower in developing nations due to various factors. These include lower levels of economic development, limited access to capital and technology, weaker labor unions and worker protections, and a greater focus on attracting foreign investment. Developing nations often prioritize job creation and economic growth over labor standards as a means to escape poverty and achieve development. Additionally, global supply chains and outsourcing practices may result in multinational corporations relocating production to countries with lower labor costs and less stringent regulations. Considering safety standards on imported goods, it can be argued that a country should impose higher safety standards on imported goods that exist in the foreign country where the goods were produced. This is because a country has a responsibility to protect the health and safety of its citizens. If the safety standards in the foreign country are insufficient or do not meet the importing country's standards, it is reasonable for the importing country to impose stricter regulations to ensure the safety of its consumers. However, care should be taken to avoid discriminatory practices and ensure that safety standards are based on scientific evidence, meet international norms, and are not used as a disguised form of protectionism."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Supply antioxidants: Nuts contain abundant antioxidants like vitamin E, polyphenols, and flavonoids, which help prevent free radical damage and chronic diseases. 3.

Boost immune system: The vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants found in nuts contribute to strengthening the immune system and enhancing the body's resistance. 5. Maintain a healthy weight: Despite having a relatively high energy density, studies suggest that consuming nuts in moderation can help control appetite, maintain satiety, and aid in weight management. 6. Improve cardiovascular health: Nuts, with their healthy fats, fiber, plant sterols, and antioxidants, have been shown to lower cholesterol levels, improve cardiovascular health, and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. 7.

How can De Moivre's theorem be described from an artist's perspective? What is the scope of this theorem? Give two examples for roots and two examples for powers.","completion":"From an artist's perspective, De Moivre's theorem can be seen as the colorful interplay between shapes and patterns. This theorem essentially allows us to raise complex numbers to a power or find their roots, unveiling mesmerizing symmetries on the canvas of mathematical imagination. The scope of De Moivre's theorem lies in complex numbers, which are numbers of the form a + bi, where \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" are real numbers and \\"i\\" represents the imaginary unit (√(-1)). This theorem helps us express and comprehend the behavior of complex numbers when raised to powers or when finding their roots. Two examples of roots using De Moivre's theorem: 1. Let's consider the complex number z = 1 + i. To find its square root using De Moivre's theorem, we can rewrite it in polar form, which is z = √2 * cis(π/4). Using the theorem, we then take the square root of the magnitude (√2) and halve the argument (π/4), yielding √2 * cis(π/8). This represents a point on the complex plane which is equidistant from the origin and 1 + i, forming a beautiful symmetrical pattern. 2. Another example is the complex number w = √3 - i. Rewriting it in polar form as w = 2 * cis(5π/6), we can find its cube root using De Moivre's theorem. Taking the cube root of the magnitude (2) and dividing the argument by 3 (5π/18), we get 2^(1/3) * cis(5π/18). This represents a point on the complex plane, forming a harmonious triangular pattern with the origin and √3 - i. Two examples of powers using De Moivre's theorem: 1. Let's consider the complex number a = 1 + i. To find a raised to the power of 4 using De Moivre's theorem, we can express it in polar form as a = √2 * cis(π/4). By raising the magnitude (√2) to the power of 4 and multiplying the argument (π/4) by 4, we obtain 4 * cis(π/16). This complex number depicts a point on the complex plane that forms a striking pattern with the origin and 1 + i. 2. Another example is the complex number b = √3 - i. Rewriting it in polar form as b = 2 * cis(5π/6), we can find b raised to the power of 5 using De Moivre's theorem. By raising the magnitude (2) to the power of 5 and multiplying the argument (5π/6) by 5, we end up with 32 * cis(25π/6). This complex number represents a point on the plane, forming a captivating pattern in conjunction with the origin and √3 - i. In the hands of an artist, De Moivre's theorem illuminates the vibrant beauty and symmetry hidden within the realm of complex numbers, allowing them to create captivating and thought-provoking visual representations."},{"prompt":"Can you explain again, as a student?","completion":"Certainly!

It is recommended to experiment and find the ratio that suits your specific needs."},{"prompt":"aws apigateway 默认支持 gzip 的requestbody吗","completion":"不，AWS API Gateway 默认不支持对 Request Body 进行 Gzip 压缩。然而，您可以在 API Gateway 的设置中启用 Gzip 压缩，以便对传入的请求进行压缩。您可以使用 AWS Lambda 函数或 AWS API Gateway 的集成请求体模板来处理压缩和解压缩操作。"},{"prompt":"API Gateway具有内置的Gzip解压缩功能吗","completion":"是的，AWS API Gateway 提供了内置的 Gzip 解压缩功能。当您将请求体传递给 API Gateway 时，它会自动检测是否使用 Gzip 压缩，并将其解压缩成原始的请求体。这意味着您可以在前端发送经过 Gzip 压缩的请求体，而 API Gateway 会自动解压缩它，然后将解压缩后的请求体传递给后端服务。这样可以减少数据传输的大小，提高性能和效率。"},{"prompt":"aws alb为什么在后台返回204状态码的时候 不携带header返回来呢","completion":"当 AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) 后台返回 204 状态码时，它不会携带 header 返回。这是由 ALB 的设计决策所决定的，并且是符合 HTTP 规范的行为。 根据 HTTP 规范，当服务器返回 204 No Content 状态码时，表示请求成功处理，但是没有需要返回的内容。因此，该响应不应该包含实体主体（即响应体），也不应该包含其他 header。 如果您需要在返回 204 状态码时携带一些信息，可以考虑使用其他状态码，如 200 OK，并在响应中包含相应的 header 和 body。然后您可以在前端或其他处理层面根据这些信息进行处理。"},{"prompt":"python中怎么对string而不是byte进行gzip解压缩","completion":"在 Python 中，您可以使用 \`gzip\` 模块对字符串进行 Gzip 解压缩。需要注意的是，将字符串解压缩成字符串可能会导致乱码或错误的结果，因为 Gzip 压缩通常处理的是字节数据。 以下是一个示例代码，展示了如何对 Gzip 压缩的字符串进行解压缩： \`\`\`python import gzip import io compressed_string = \\"H4sIAAAAAAAEAMtIzcnJVyjPL8pJUeJUeAJFcvkpKImQBQAvlUEEAAAA=\\" compressed_data = compressed_string.encode(\\"utf-8\\") compressed_bytes = io.BytesIO(compressed_data) with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=compressed_bytes, mode=\\"rb\\") as gzip_file: decompressed_data = gzip_file.read() decompressed_string = decompressed_data.decode(\\"utf-8\\") print(decompressed_string) \`\`\` 请注意，这里的 \`compressed_string\` 是一个经过 Gzip 压缩的字符串。将其转换为字节数组后，使用 \`gzip.GzipFile\` 进行解压缩。解压缩后的结果会是字节数组，通过使用适当的字符编码，如 \\"utf-8\\"，将其转换为字符串。 但是，请注意，如果原始的字符串不是通过 Gzip 压缩的，或者不是有效的 Gzip 格式，解压缩会引发异常。因此，在进行解压缩之前，确保字符串经过了正确的 Gzip 压缩。"},{"prompt":"为什么运行上面的代码会报错","completion":"对不起，我之前提供的代码有误。在 Python 中，\`gzip\` 模块只能处理字节数据，无法直接对字符串进行 Gzip 解压缩。 如果您有一个经过 Gzip 压缩的字符串，首先需要将其转换为字节数据，然后再进行解压缩操作。可以使用 \`base64\` 模块将字符串解码为字节数据，然后再使用 \`gzip\` 模块进行解压缩。 以下是修正后的代码示例： \`\`\`python import gzip import base64 compressed_string = \\"H4sIAAAAAAAEAMtIzcnJVyjPL8pJUeJUeAJFcvkpKImQBQAvlUEEAAAA=\\" compressed_data = base64.b64decode(compressed_string) with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=compressed_data, mode=\\"rb\\") as gzip_file: decompressed_data = gzip_file.read() decompressed_string = decompressed_data.decode(\\"utf-8\\") print(decompressed_string) \`\`\` 在这个示例中，首先使用 \`base64.b64decode()\` 将被 Gzip 压缩的字符串解码为字节数据，然后再通过 \`gzip.GzipFile\` 进行解压缩。最后，将解压缩后的字节数据转换为字符串。 请确保被解压缩的字符串经过了正确的 Gzip 压缩，并且在解码之前需要先进行 Base64 解码。"},{"prompt":"七夕情人节常见的元素和画面","completion":"七夕情人节常见的元素和画面包括： 1. 七夕牛郎织女的传说，画面上常常出现牛郎织女相会、牵手、相视而笑的情景。 2. 浪漫的星空，七夕是在农历七月七日，人们往往在夜晚仰望星空，希望借助天狼星与织女星的桥梁，表达爱情的祝福。 3. 缤纷的灯笼和烟花，七夕是一个喜庆热闹的节日，人们常常会点亮灯笼、放烟花庆祝，给晚会增添浓厚的氛围。 4. 鲜花和巧克力，情人节必不可少的礼物，人们常常会送给对方鲜花和巧克力来表达爱意。 5. 情侣手牵手或拥抱的姿势，七夕情人节是爱情的节日，人们常常会表达对爱人的深情，手牵手、拥抱等画面是常见的表达方式。 6. 情侣约会的场景，七夕情人节通常是情侣之间约会的好时机，可以选择浪漫的餐厅、公园、电影院等地方，一起度过快乐的时光。 7. 制作纸鹊和念愿望的情景，七夕节还有制作纸鹊的传统习俗，人们会在七夕当天念愿望，希望得到美好的爱情。 8. 情侣互赠礼物或手写情书的场景，七夕节是表达爱意的好时机，人们常常会互相送礼物或手写情书来表达内心的感情。"},{"prompt":"中秋常见的元素和画面","completion":"中秋节常见的元素和画面包括： 1. 月亮和兔子，中秋节是庆祝丰收和团圆的节日，人们常常会在晚上仰望明亮的月亮，同时也有兔子吃月饼的传说，因此月亮和兔子是常见的元素之一。 2. 丰收的农田和稻谷，中秋节是农历八月十五，正处在秋季丰收的时节，人们常常会用稻谷、水果等元素来代表丰收和庆祝丰收的喜悦。 3. 烟花和灯笼，中秋节是一个庆祝的节日，人们常常会点亮灯笼、放烟花来增加喜庆的气氛。 4. 家庭团圆的场景，中秋节是一个强调团圆的节日，人们会和家人一起吃团圆饭、赏月、品尝月饼，营造温馨的家庭氛围。 5. 吃月饼的画面，中秋节的特色美食是月饼，人们常常会在中秋节期间互赠月饼，同时也会举行吃月饼的活动，增添节日的喜庆气氛。 6. 赏月的画面，中秋节晚上的月亮明亮而圆，人们会到户外或室外的露台上赏月，而且有些地方还会举办赏月活动，共同欣赏美丽的月亮。 7. 儿童玩具和秋千，中秋节也是一个儿童喜爱的节日，在中秋节期间，孩子们常常会玩灯笼、秋千等游戏，增加节日的欢乐气氛。 8. 诗词和歌谣，中秋节是中国传统文化的重要节日，人们常常会通过朗诵古诗词或唱中秋歌谣来表达对中秋节的喜爱和祝福。"},{"prompt":"重阳节常见的元素和画面","completion":"重阳节常见的元素和画面包括： 1. 菊花，菊花是重阳节的代表花卉，人们常常会赏菊、插菊或用菊花来装饰庆祝重阳节。 2. 登高远足的场景，重阳节是秋季的节日，人们常常会选择登高山、远足或郊游，欣赏秋天的美景，同时也有避邪、祈福之意。 3. 喝菊花酒和赏菊的活动，重阳节期间人们会喝菊花酒，认为菊花酒有提神、抗衰老的作用，同时也会赏菊花展览，欣赏各色菊花的美丽。 4. 饮茶和吃重阳糕的画面，重阳节是一个重视健康、长寿的节日，人们常常会饮茶、品茗，并且还会吃重阳糕，以迎接节日的到来。 5. 爬山锻炼和呼吸新鲜空气的场景，重阳节是一个强调健康和长寿的节日，人们常常会出门爬山、锻炼身体，呼吸新鲜的秋天空气，以增强体质。 6. 诗词朗诵和赋诗的活动，重阳节是中国传统文化的重要节日，人们常常会通过朗诵古诗词、赋诗来表达对节日的祝福和赞美。 7. 儿童嬉戏的画面，重阳节也是一个儿童喜爱的节日，孩子们常常会在重阳节期间一起嬉戏玩耍，增添节日的欢乐气氛。 8. 中老年人团聚的场景，重阳节是一个强调尊老敬老的节日，人们常常会与长辈团聚，表达对长辈的敬意，共同度过快乐的节日。"},{"prompt":"which tooling can quickly code an ar app","completion":"There are several tools available that can help quickly code an AR (Augmented Reality) app. Some popular ones include: 1.
