Despite the Qara Khitai's military strength and advanced technology, they were no match for the Mongol Empire's battle tactics and superior military force. The Mongols used a combination of guerrilla warfare and military might to defeat the Qara Khitai. The conquest of the Qara Khitai was a significant event in the history of the Mongol Empire.

The Mongol Empire's conquest of the Qara Khitai also had far-reaching consequences for the region's culture and economy, as the Mongols replaced traditional trading networks with their own system.

The Dutch were one of the European powers who arrived in Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) in the 17th century with the intention of establishing a trading post. Initially, they were granted permission by the local King to set up a base in the city of Galle, and soon they began to expand their control over other parts of the island. In 1638, the Dutch set their sights on Batticaloa, a city on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. The Portuguese had controlled the city earlier, but it had been taken over by the King of Kandy. The Dutch launched an attack and after a brief siege, were able to capture the city. This was a significant victory for the Dutch as Batticaloa was a key trading center and its capture allowed them to access resources from the east coast. Three years later, in 1641, the Dutch turned their attention to the city of Colombo, which was then ruled by the Portuguese. The Dutch launched a massive attack, and after a five-month siege, the Portuguese finally surrendered. Colombo was a significant stronghold for the Portuguese, and its capture gave the Dutch control over much of the western coast of Sri Lanka. In conclusion, the Dutch capture of Batticaloa happened first in 1638, followed by the capture of Colombo in 1641.

This impressive winning streak not only cemented their place as the top team in the league but also gave them momentum heading into the playoffs. Throughout the season, the Warriors had already established themselves as a dominant force in the league, led by the reigning MVP, Stephen Curry. They won their division with ease and finished the regular season with a record of 67-15, the best in the NBA that year. However, it was the closing stretch of the regular season where the Warriors truly shone. They won 16 consecutive games, which started on March 14 with a victory against the New York Knicks and ended on April 15 with a win against the Denver Nuggets. During this incredible run, the Warriors defeated several top-tier opponents, including the Memphis Grizzlies, San Antonio Spurs, and Portland Trail Blazers. The streak highlights the Warriors' tenacity, discipline, and excellent teamwork, all qualities that would prove instrumental in their eventual NBA championship victory that season.

The killer, later identified as Steve Wright, was eventually convicted of these heinous crimes. The investigation was a huge operation, with multiple law enforcement agencies and officers involved in the hunt for the murderer. One such agency was News of the World, a now-defunct tabloid newspaper in the UK. They followed officers tracking a suspect in the murder probe, hoping to get exclusive details and photos of the investigation. While it is not uncommon for journalists to cover high-profile cases, some critics have argued that the media's intense scrutiny can sometimes hinder the work of law enforcement officials. In this case, it is unclear what impact, if any, the newspaper's presence had on the investigation. Regardless, the Ipswich murders remain a tragic reminder of the dangers that sex workers face, and the importance of adequate protection and support for those in this vulnerable profession.

The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain. The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and a dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.

The stadiums chosen were located in different parts of the world, and they are not only considered to be aesthetically unappealing but also lack functionality. Among the list were stadiums from different parts of the world, including Britain and Bangkok. One such stadium that made the list was the Olympic Stadium in London, which was built for the 2012 Olympics. Although the venue was praised for its engineering prowess and state-of-the-art facilities, the aesthetics of the stadium did not impress many. Additionally, the National Stadium of Cambodia, located in Phnom Penh, was another stadium on the list. The stadium, also known as the \\"Dragon Stadium,\\" was constructed in 1963 and saw its heyday during the 60s and 70s. However, due to years of neglect and disrepair, the stadium has become a symbol of the city's decline. While the list encompasses many of the world's most controversial arenas and stadiums, there are undoubtedly more that were omitted from the list. For instance, the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a well-renowned stadium, but it has struggled with ongoing maintenance issues, resulting in various problems such as power cuts, access control problems, and pet infestations. Ultimately, though the list may be subjective, one cannot deny the poor aesthetics or infrastructural design that some of these stadiums possess.

Partly due to inefficient generation of electricity in the USSR (only 20.8% thermal efficiency in 1950 vs. 36.2% in 1975), in 1950 diesel traction was about twice as energy efficient as electric traction (in terms of net tonnekm of freight per kg of fuel). But as efficiency of electricity generation (and thus of electric traction) improved, by about 1965 electric railways became more efficient than diesel. After the mid 1970s electrics used about 25% less fuel per tonkm. However diesels were mainly used on single track lines with a fair amount of traffic so that the lower fuel consumption of electrics may be in part due to better operating conditions on electrified lines (such as double tracking) rather than inherent energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the cost of diesel fuel was about 1.5 times more (per unit of heat energy content) than that of the fuel used in electric power plants (that generated electricity), thus making electric railways even more energycost effective.

These types of boats are designed with fishing in mind, typically featuring a wide and stable platform for casting and reeling in fish. They often have storage compartments for fishing gear and live wells to keep your catch fresh. For those seeking a more leisurely time on the water, a pontoon boat is a great choice.

Pontoon boats are also excellent for hosting parties or picnics, as they have ample space to accommodate guests and supplies.

Senior doctors warn a change in law will pressurise the elderly into wanting to end their. lives for fear of being a burden on their relatives. British Medical Association, Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of GPs – all oppose assisted suicide as do most doctors according to polls.","completion":"The recent announcement of the British Medical Journal's (BMJ) support for assisted suicide has stirred up controversy and concern within the medical community. Many senior doctors have expressed their apprehension about the potential implications of a change in law that would allow for assisted suicide. One of the most pressing concerns is that such a change would put undue pressure on the elderly. There is a fear that many elderly people, who already struggle with feelings of being a burden on their families, might view assisted suicide as a way to alleviate that burden. This could lead to situations where individuals feel compelled to end their lives prematurely. These concerns are not new. The British Medical Association, Royal College of Physicians, and Royal College of GPs have all opposed assisted suicide. Polls also suggest that a majority of doctors in the UK share this view. The current legal framework, which imposes a blanket ban on assisted suicide, has been put in place precisely to prevent such situations from arising. However, advocates of assisted suicide argue that the current legal framework is too restrictive and denies individuals the right to choose how they want to end their lives. They argue that those suffering from terminal illnesses or chronic pain should be allowed to die with dignity, and that assisted suicide could provide a humane way to achieve this. Regardless of one's position on this issue, it is clear that any change in the law would have far-reaching consequences. It would be vital to ensure that such a change is introduced with safeguards in place to prevent abuse and to protect vulnerable individuals who might feel pressured into ending their lives. In the meantime, it is important for healthcare professionals to continue to provide compassionate end-of-life care and support to their patients. This includes palliative care, which can help patients manage pain and other symptoms and improve their quality of life in their final days. It is crucial that patients feel supported and reassured that their healthcare team is dedicated to alleviating their suffering in a safe, ethical way."},{"prompt":"Does The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular the Romantics, followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks. contain the correct answer to What culture was well established by the 6th Century BC?

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable.

This dialect developed in the late Ming dynasty when Xiamen was increasingly taking over Quanzhou's position as the main port of trade in southeastern China. Quanzhou traders began travelling southwards to Xiamen to carry on their businesses while Zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities. It is at this time when a need for a common language arose. The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways (as can be seen from the common place of Henan Luoyang where they originated), but due to differences in accents, communication can be a problem.

He warns that potential enemies are quickly advancing in space technology and are copying American techniques. This has made the US vulnerable and heavily dependent on satellite intelligence. While the US has been a leader in space technology for quite some time, other countries are quickly closing the gap. According to General Shelton, potential enemies are investing heavily in space technology and are becoming more sophisticated in their approach. As a result, America's dominance in space may be in jeopardy. One of the biggest concerns is the US dependency on satellite intelligence. The military relies heavily on satellite technology for everything from navigation to communication. In the event of an attack on the US satellite network, the military would be greatly impacted. The loss of satellite technology would compromise not only military operations, but also commercial and civilian activities. General Shelton's call to action is not without precedent. In the past, other military leaders have also expressed their concerns about the potential space war. However, the current geopolitical climate and the rapid advancement of space technology have made his warnings more urgent. In conclusion, General Shelton's call for preparedness for a potential space war should not be ignored. The US must remain vigilant and proactive in its approach to space technology. This means investing in new technology, creating better defenses, and strengthening relationships with our allies.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. By the late 1990s, blue LEDs became widely available. They have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN quantum wells sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN, called cladding layers. By varying the relative In/Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells, the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber. Aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN) of varying Al/Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN/GaN blue/green devices. If unalloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers, the device will emit nearultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365 nm.

The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known death romances such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that longlong stairway, the joy is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur.

After just over four years on the throne, Wenceslaus II was forced to abdicate in 1305.

I mean, this was 1990 if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the '80s. If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time. It wasn't until Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized, and story boarders began to use that motive. But you'll have fond memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, even Power Rangers, if you watch this film. The enemy robot is very menacing. It makes you not want to face the man without a really good backup plan. And there are some great moments within this film. A traitor/spy is working within their midsts.

Shaving is an option that can provide you with a quick and easy solution, but it's important to do it correctly to avoid skin irritation or unwanted hair growth. First of all, note that shaving your unibrow is a short-term solution. The hair will grow back within a few days, so you'll need to repeat the process regularly. If you're looking for something more long-lasting, consider other options such as tweezing or waxing, which can keep your unibrow at bay for a couple of weeks. If shaving is your preferred method, invest in an eyebrow touch up razor, which is specifically designed to shave eyebrows. These razors are smaller and more precise than regular ones, making it easier to target only the hair you want to remove. Before you start shaving, make sure your skin is clean and free of any products or debris. You can use a gentle cleanser or toner to remove any dirt or oils that might interfere with the razor's glide. Next, apply a small amount of standard shaving cream to your unibrow. This will help reduce friction and prevent razor burn or cuts. Be sure to spread the cream evenly and avoid applying too much, which could create a mess. Take your razor and run it under water to wet the blade. Then, gently glide the razor over your unibrow, starting from the outside and working your way inwards. Take your time and use short, controlled strokes to avoid removing more hair than necessary. Once you've finished shaving, wipe off the shaving cream and hair with a wet washcloth. Rinse your skin with cool water and pat it dry with a clean towel. Avoid rubbing or scratching your skin, which could cause irritation or inflammation. Finally, don't forget to moisturize your skin to help replenish its natural oils and prevent dryness. You can use a lightweight lotion or serum that won't clog your pores or make your skin greasy. In conclusion, shaving your unibrow can be a quick and easy way to get rid of unwanted hair. Just make sure to use the right razor, apply shaving cream, and take your time to avoid any mishaps. With a little practice, you'll be able to get a smooth and flawless look in no time."},{"prompt":"Tweet: I wait for @liiiindsaay Predict the sentiment of this tweet.

The Tories are looking to give local people the \\"Right to Build\\", which involves demanding plots from councils. This move is aimed at increasing the number of self-build projects across the UK, which would help meet the demand for affordable housing. By giving people the chance to build their own homes, it encourages creativity and can help building costs. In conclusion, self-build projects can seem like a daunting prospect, but with local support and a practical approach, it can be a viable way for people to get on the housing ladder. The government is taking steps to make this option more accessible to local people, and it is an exciting time for those looking to build their own homes."},{"prompt":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Common Law Cabin (original title How Much Lovin' Does a Normal Couple Need?) is a 1967 exploitation film directed by Russ Meyer.

Meeting comes as more than 1,000 die in Cairo's 'urban warfare'","completion":"The recent news about 1.5 billion that is due to go to Egyptian leaders as part of the U.S. aid package has raised some concerns. The meeting comes at a time when more than 1,000 people have lost their lives in what can only be described as 'urban warfare' in Cairo. Many people find it difficult to justify the distribution of aid to countries where there is so much unrest and violence. The fact that the leaders of Egypt will be receiving such a significant amount of money at this time has divided opinions. On the one hand, some argue that it is important to continue to provide aid to Egypt in order to support the country and its people. They believe that it is crucial to maintain stability and prevent further unrest. On the other hand, others argue that giving money to leaders who are not properly managing the situation in their country is not the solution. Instead, they suggest that the aid should be given to groups who are working to create positive change in Egypt and alleviate the suffering of the people.

Pieweights are available as ceramic or metal beads, but rice, dried peas, lentils, beans or other pulses can be used instead. When using this method for a fully baked crust, the weights are removed before the prebaking is complete in order to achieve a browned crust. Another technique dispenses with weights by placing a second pie tin on top of the crust, then inverting the tins to bake. In this method, the crust browns between the tins. A further simplified technique involves piercing the crust repeatedly with the tines of a fork to produce small holes, allowing steam to escape and preventing the crust from bubbling up, but that does not work with soft doughs such as pâte sucrée.

With gridtied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.

Napoleon became first consul for ten years, with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only.

Critics have noted that Clinton's account of her tenure as secretary of state leaves out a lot of the gritty details, and instead opts to give readers a shiny, polished version of events. This has led some to speculate whether this is a calculated move, designed to paint Clinton in a more positive light ahead of any future political ambitions.
