It was difficult for a commander to advance far into fresh territory without having secured his lines of communication by capturing these fortifications, which slowed the progress of any attack. Armies of the period could be formed from either feudal or mercenary forces. Feudal levies could only be raised for a fixed length of time before they returned home, forcing an end to a campaign; mercenary forces, often called Brabançons after the Duchy of Brabant but actually recruited from across northern Europe, could operate all year long and provide a commander with more strategic options to pursue a campaign, but cost much more than equivalent feudal forces.

They theorized that pain intensity (the sensory discriminative dimension) and unpleasantness (the affectivemotivational dimension) are not simply determined by the magnitude of the painful stimulus, but higher cognitive activities can influence perceived intensity and unpleasantness. Cognitive activities may affect both sensory and affective experience or they may modify primarily the affectivemotivational dimension. Thus, excitement in games or war appears to block both dimensions of pain, while suggestion and placebos may modulate the affectivemotivational dimension and leave the sensorydiscriminative dimension relatively undisturbed. (p. 432) The paper ends with a call to action: Pain can be treated not only by trying to cut down the sensory input by anesthetic block, surgical intervention and the like, but also by influencing the motivationalaffective and cognitive factors as well.

Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her greatgrandsons, Tsarevich Alexei of Russia, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill.

According to reports, the 38-year-old father forgot about his daughter and left her in the car. After work, the father called 911 and stated that his daughter needed medical help. When emergency services arrived at the scene, they found the little girl unconscious in the car. Her mother, who had been notified of the incident, followed the operator's instructions and performed CPR. The child was rushed to the hospital in Hillsboro but unfortunately, she later died. The father, who works at Intel, reportedly left his daughter in the car in a large company parking lot. This incident serves as a tragic reminder of the dangers of leaving children unattended in vehicles. The temperature inside a car can rise to deadly levels quickly, especially on hot days. In the United States, an average of 39 children die every year due to heatstroke caused by being left in a car. This is a preventable tragedy that can happen to anyone. It is important for parents and caregivers to take extra precautions to ensure the safety of their children in vehicles, even if it's just for a few minutes. Some tips to avoid these tragedies include making it a habit to always check the backseat of the car before locking it, placing a reminder or an important item such as a cell phone or bag in the backseat, and teaching children not to play in or near cars. It is also essential to call 911 immediately if a child is left alone in a vehicle. This incident is a heartbreaking reminder of how important it is to prioritize the safety of our children, and to take extra precautions to ensure they are kept out of harm's way.

The Early Cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways, and as a result, the decline and extinction of sauropods (except in South America). Many coastal shallows were created, and that caused Ichthyosaurs to die out. Mosasaurs evolved to replace them as head of the seas. Some islandhopping dinosaurs, like Eustreptospondylus, evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient Europe. Other dinosaurs rose up to fill the empty space that the JurassicCretaceous extinction left behind, such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus. Of the most successful would be the Iguanodon which spread to every continent. Seasons came back into effect and the poles got seasonally colder, but dinosaurs still inhabited this area like the Leaellynasaura which inhabited the polar forests yearround, and many dinosaurs migrated there during summer like Muttaburrasaurus.

At Goldman Sachs, young employees will automatically become full time instead of getting a twoyear contract. Goldman Sachs hires will also be discouraged from working on the weekends.","completion":"The Tragic Death of Moritz Erhardt Prompts Change in Banking Industry Moritz Erhardt was a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America when he tragically died from a seizure after reportedly working three straight days. The incident raised concerns about working conditions and the culture of the banking industry. Responding to the incident, several major banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, are making changes to their entry-level programs. Goldman Sachs, for example, is automatically promoting young employees to full-time positions instead of offering two-year contracts. The company is also making efforts to discourage weekend work, a common practice in the industry. These changes reflect a growing awareness in the banking industry of the importance of work-life balance. The death of Mr. Erhardt has sent shockwaves through the banking industry, with many calling for more attention to be paid to the well-being of those working in the sector. While banking has traditionally been known for long hours and intense workloads, many believe that this culture needs to change in order to ensure the health and safety of young employees. Other banks have also responded to the incident by increasing their efforts to improve work-life balance. JPMorgan, for example, is introducing a new rotation system for interns to ensure that they get enough rest and avoid overwork. The changes being made by these banks are an important step in the right direction. However, more needs to be done to address the underlying issues facing young people in the banking industry. The pressures of working in high-stress, high-stakes environments can take a toll on mental and physical health, and it is essential that banks take responsibility for the well-being of their employees. In the wake of Mr. Erhardt's death, the banking industry has been forced to confront some uncomfortable truths about work-life balance and the culture of the sector. However, by making changes to their entry-level programs and encouraging a healthier approach to work, banks can begin to create a more sustainable, supportive environment for their employees."},{"prompt":"Read this: The cuisine of Switzerland is multifaceted.

The raw materials for laboratoryscale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material.

In particular, the Republicans have been protesting against the way Democrats run the Senate, while Democrats have been frustrated with their Republican counterparts over nominations. One of the issues causing tension between the parties is tax credits. Typically, this is an area favored by Republicans, but with the current procedural stalemate, it has become a point of contention between the parties. Republicans have been pushing for tax credits as a means of spurring economic growth, but Democrats have been resistant, arguing that any such credits should be targeted towards lower and middle-income families. At the heart of the problem is the fact that traditional Senate rules have been broken down, making it difficult for either party to push their own agenda forward. Democrats have accused Republicans of blocking their ideas, while Republicans have complained that Democrats are obstructing their own proposals. The result of this deadlock is a Senate that is struggling to keep up with legislative business. Both parties are pushing for changes to the way the Senate operates, with Republicans calling for more control over the agenda and Democrats calling for a more equitable process that allows both parties to have input.

Though he had, by the early 1260s, become closely identified with China, he still, for a time, claimed universal rule, and yet despite his successes in China and Korea, Khubilai was unable to have himself accepted as the Great Khan. Thus, with such limited acceptance of his position as Great Khan, Kublai Khan increasingly became identified with China and sought support as Emperor of China. What is the answer to this question: When did the Yuan dynasty rule?","completion":"The Yuan dynasty ruled from 1271 to 1368."},{"prompt":"Write the next sentence in the following story. How to remove double sided tape Remove stubborn, stuckon tape with a hairdryer. Plug your hairdryer into the nearest power outlet and turn it on to a medium or high setting. Hold the hairdryer a few inches away from the tape and let the hot air blow over it, focusing on the edges and corners. OPTIONS: Try to do this only once to three times in a row.

This record was set by Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos on December 8, 2013, during a game against the Tennessee Titans. Prater's kick just barely cleared the crossbar, giving him the record and a place in NFL history. Prior to Prater's record-breaking kick, the record was held by Tom Dempsey and Jason Elam, who both kicked 63-yard field goals. Dempsey set the record in 1970 while playing for the New Orleans Saints, while Elam tied it in 1998 while playing for the Broncos. While 64 yards may seem like an impossible distance for a field goal, it is important to note that several factors can greatly affect a kicker's ability to kick a long field goal. These factors can include wind, temperature, location of the stadium, and the kicker's own skill level and confidence. Despite these challenges, kickers continue to attempt longer and longer field goals, and it is possible that one day someone may break Matt Prater's record. Until then, his kick will remain the longest field goal in NFL history, and a testament to the skill and determination of one of the greatest kickers of all time."},{"prompt":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation? 10 months ago 3912 xHamster Japanese uncensored Japanese Asian 18","completion":"10 months ago, 3912 xHamster Japanese uncensored Japanese Asian 18."},{"prompt":"basic patterns for mobile navigation This is all lower case.

Use gentle soaps and natural cleaning products. Avoid scratching your skin.","completion":"To prevent dryness, it is essential to reduce the temperature of baths and showers. Hot water can quickly strip the skin of moisture, leading to dry and itchy skin. However, warm water can help to retain natural oils within the skin, thus keeping the skin soft and supple. It is also crucial to use gentle soaps and natural cleaning products. Harsh soaps and detergents can strip away the protective oils present on the skin's surface, leading to dryness and itching. Choosing natural and gentle products for cleansing can help to maintain the skin's moisture and prevent dryness. Another essential tip to prevent dry skin is to avoid scratching or rubbing the skin. Scratching can irritate the skin further and cause redness and rashes. Instead, apply a moisturizer or lotion to relieve dryness and itching. In conclusion, caring for the skin can be simple and effective by reducing the temperature of baths and using gentle cleansers. Avoid scratching the skin, and use a moisturizer to prevent dryness.

The Garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields. The Garamantes grew populous and strong, conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves (which were put to work extending the tunnels). The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads. However, they traded with the Garamantes, and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes capital of Garama. Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes territory. The Garamantes civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains.

Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight.

Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is poor. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment do, however, appear effective.

The Dutch were well-known for their shipbuilding industry, which was fueled by the country's access to the sea and their dominance in international trade. They also had advancements in textile manufacturing and urbanization, with Amsterdam becoming a major center of commerce and culture. Italy also played a significant role in the early stages of industrialization. Italian cities such as Florence, Venice, and Milan were known for their textile manufacturing, with advanced techniques in silk production. Italy also had a strong banking system, which contributed to the growth of trade and commerce. China was another country that had a head start in industrialization. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), China had advanced techniques in agriculture, iron production, and ceramics. The country also had a sophisticated system of irrigation, which allowed them to produce large quantities of rice and other crops. China's technological advancements eventually spread to other parts of the world and greatly influenced the development of Western industries. It's important to note that the Industrial Revolution in Britain was not an isolated event, but rather a culmination of advancements and innovations that had taken place over centuries. While Britain may have been at the forefront of industrialization during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was preceded by several other countries that had made significant contributions to the advancement of technology and commerce."},{"prompt":"Read this and answer the question The Boston Globe and the Boston Herald are two of the city's major daily newspapers.

Overdraft fees have also risen to a 16th consecutive high of 32.74. Fees rise as lenders adjust to new laws and regulations following 2008 crisis. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Bank customers in the United States are facing an increase in fees for using ATM machines that are not affiliated with their bank, as well as for overdrafts. Last year, the penalty for using an out-of-network ATM went up by 5%, which means that the average fee for a single transaction has increased to 4.35. Similarly, overdraft fees have reached a 16th consecutive high of 32.74. The rise in fees can be attributed to the new laws and regulations implemented by lenders in response to the 2008 financial crisis. As banks strive to comply with increasing regulations, they are passing on the costs to their customers in the form of higher fees. This has led to a growing concern among many customers who are struggling to make ends meet. For those who are not able to maintain a minimum balance in their accounts, the fees can be particularly burdensome. In some cases, customers who are charged overdraft fees may end up paying more than the actual amount of the overdraft itself. This can lead to a vicious cycle of debt and financial stress. To avoid these fees, customers are encouraged to use ATMs that are affiliated with their bank, as well as to diligently monitor their account balances to avoid overdrafts. Additionally, customers should take advantage of any alerts or notifications offered by their bank to keep track of their finances. In conclusion, while the increase in fees may seem small, it can have a significant impact on customers who are already struggling to make ends meet. As banks continue to adjust to new laws and regulations, it is important for customers to be aware of the fees they may face and to take proactive steps to avoid them."},{"prompt":"bits from the release team and jessie's freeze Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","completion":"Bits from the release team and Jessie's freeze."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: who sang have you ever really loved a woman?","completion":"Bryan Adams sang \\"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","completion":"Context: Due to recent advancements in technology, virtual reality has become an increasingly popular way of experiencing entertainment and gaming.

Harrison from Bell Telephone Laboratories disclosed that the recording pattern of the Western Electric rubber line magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic. This meant that as frequency increased in the treble, recording amplitude decreased. Conversely, in the bass as frequency decreased, recording amplitude increased. Therefore, it was necessary to attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250 Hz, the bass turnover point, in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head. Otherwise, bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove. When played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region, a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary. G. H.

According to recent research, tectonic plates have been discovered hidden deep within the Earth's mantle. This has important implications for the understanding of the evolution of western North America. For decades, scientists have studied the tectonic plates that make up the Earth's crust. These plates move over time and cause earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain building. However, until recently, no one knew that plates could exist further down in the Earth's mantle. The discovery of these new plates is a major find. It challenges the long-held assumption that the mantle is a homogenous layer of rock that slowly convects over millions of years. Instead, it suggests that there may be other factors at play, such as the movement of tectonic plates. This discovery has important implications for the evolution of western North America. Geologists have long debated the mechanisms that caused the formation of the Rocky Mountains and other features of the western landscape. The discovery of these new tectonic plates could help explain how these features were created. Overall, this discovery represents a major breakthrough in our understanding of the Earth's geology.

Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6 °C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.

In the second quarter, Denver's defensive problem continued as RB Larry Johnson got a 1yard TD run. The Broncos would finally score as kicker Jason Elam nailed a 31yard field goal. In the third quarter, Tynes helped the Chiefs get a 34yard field goal, while Plummer completed a 1yard TD pass to TE Stephen Alexander. In the fourth quarter, Tynes gave Kansas City a 29yard and a 21yard field goal. The Broncos tried to respond, but K.C.'s improved defense stopped any hope of a comeback.

The Polish Army's victory over the Red Army at the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920 has been credited with saving Europe from communist expansion. The Polish Armed Forces in 1920 were split into two main groups: the Polish Army, which was responsible for defending Poland's borders, and the People's Army, which was formed as a voluntary militia and played a major role in the war's early stages. The Polish Army had around 550,000 soldiers, while the People's Army numbered roughly 187,000 volunteers. Both the Polish Army and the People's Army were formed with the help of French military advisers, who provided training and equipment to the Polish forces. The government of Poland also put a great deal of effort into mobilizing its citizens, and many volunteers joined the armed forces to help defend their country against the Soviet threat. In addition to soldiers, the Polish Armed Forces also had a large number of horses, which were used for transportation and in combat. These animals were an essential part of the Polish Army's mobility and contributed significantly to their success on the battlefield. Overall, the Polish Armed Forces in August 1920 were a formidable military force that played a critical role in the defense of Poland against the Soviet invasion.

This statement comes after President Bush encouraged China to sit down with the \\"man of peace.\\" Despite China's claims that U.S. leaders are violating the basic principles of international relations by honoring the Dalai Lama, the White House states they are not \\"poking a stick\\" in China's eye. The Dalai Lama has long been recognized as a symbol of peace and compassion, and his message of nonviolence is one that people around the world can appreciate. However, China has long tried to paint the Dalai Lama as a separatist, accusing him of working towards Tibetan independence. China's allegations of a hidden agenda are not new, but the Dalai Lama has always denied them. In fact, he has repeatedly expressed his desire for true autonomy for Tibet within China, rather than independence. President Bush's encouragement for China to sit down with the Dalai Lama is a positive step towards promoting peace and understanding between the two countries. It is important for China to listen to the Dalai Lama's message, just as it is important for the rest of the world to support his efforts. Despite China's accusations, the United States is not \\"poking a stick\\" in China's eye by honoring the Dalai Lama. Rather, the U.S. is recognizing the Dalai Lama for his work towards peace and compassion, and supporting his efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the situation in Tibet. In the end, it is important for both China and the rest of the world to respect each other's views and work towards a peaceful resolution that benefits everyone.

The 32-year-old striker was named in the starting line-up after his transfer from Toronto FC. Defoe, who is known for his scoring abilities, failed to get on the score sheet despite his efforts. However, he played an integral role in Sunderland's attacking play, contributing with his runs and passes. The game was a competitive one, with both teams creating chances. Sunderland had their fair share of attacks, but were unable to convert them into goals. Tottenham ultimately sealed a 2-1 victory, with goals from Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane. For Defoe, it was a bittersweet return to White Hart Lane. The striker spent two spells with Tottenham during his career, scoring 143 goals in total. He was a popular figure among the Spurs fans and received a warm reception when he was substituted in the second half. Despite the result, Sunderland fans will be pleased to see their new signing in action. Defoe's experience and goal-scoring abilities will undoubtedly be an asset to the team as they fight to avoid relegation this season. Overall, it was a solid performance from Defoe in his first start for Sunderland. While he was unable to find the back of the net, he showed glimpses of the quality that has made him a successful striker throughout his career.
