Redirect the fear. Make choices. Forgive.","completion":"Making the First Move, Redirecting Fear, Making Choices, and Forgiving: Four Principles for Living a Fulfilling Life Many people spend their lives waiting for something to happen, waiting for someone else to make the first move, waiting for the perfect opportunity to present itself. However, life is not a passive experience, and waiting for things to happen rarely leads to a fulfilling life. Instead, it takes courage to make the first move, to take responsibility for one's own life, and to create opportunities oneself. Making the first move requires stepping out of one's comfort zone, and doing something that may feel uncomfortable. However, it is often these uncomfortable actions that lead to personal growth and development. Whether it be starting a new project, initiating a conversation or taking up a new hobby, making the first move is an essential principle for living a fulfilling life. Fear is a natural human emotion that can often hold people back from making the first move. However, fear can also be a powerful motivator to redirect one's energy towards positive outcomes. By acknowledging one's fear and using it as a tool for progress, individuals can overcome their anxieties, and take bold steps towards personal and professional success. Making choices is perhaps one of the most important principles for living a fulfilling life. Life offers an endless array of options, and individuals cannot do everything; therefore, it is critical to make deliberate choices to prioritize what is essential. By making choices that align with an individual's values and goals, and focusing on what is significant, one can live a life that is meaningful and fulfilling. Forgiveness is the final crucial principle for living a fulfilling life. We are all human and make mistakes, and often those mistakes can weigh heavily on us. However, forgiveness, whether it be forgiving ourselves or others, can lead to a sense of release and liberation. By practicing forgiveness, individuals can let go of past mistakes, and move forward with a renewed sense of purpose. In conclusion, making the first move, redirecting fear, making choices, and forgiving are four essential principles that can lead to a fulfilling life. By taking these concepts to heart, individuals can create a life filled with meaning, purpose, and joy."},{"prompt":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The March<br>Tom's city had an uptick in police violence.

The lack of information and updates about the status of the investigation have left many family members frustrated and angry. Some have taken their grievances to the Malaysian embassy in Beijing, hoping to get answers from Malaysian officials. Political reasons may be behind China's reluctance to allow street protests. The government is known to limit protests to avoid potential for social unrest. The large number of people affected by the missing flight, combined with public dissatisfaction, could become problematic if allowed to escalate. The government may also fear that the protests would attract supporters of other issues, leading to a more significant threat to its authority. China is keen not to damage its relationship with Malaysia, which is an ASEAN partner. Despite the frustrations of the Chinese people, the government is unlikely to take any action that could harm its relationship with Malaysia.

Nevertheless, Plato holds that matter is real, though transitory and imperfect, and is perceived by our body and its senses and given existence by the eternal ideas that are perceived directly by our rational soul. Plato was therefore a metaphysical and epistemological dualist, an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid: Plato's thought cannot therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense, although quantum physics' assertion that man's consciousness is an immutable and primary requisite for not merely perceiving but shaping matter, and thus his reality, would give more credence to Plato's dualist position.[citation needed] What branch of physics might support a worldview similar to Platonic dualism?

However, there are small actions you can take that can make a big difference in their life. One of the most important things you can do is to validate their feelings. To validate someone's feelings means to acknowledge and accept them, without necessarily agreeing with or solving their issues. It's important to show your friend that you understand their emotions and that you are there to support them. One simple way to do this is by calling or texting them once or twice a week just to check in. Let them know that you're available to talk if they need to vent or share their thoughts. Another way to support your friend is by inviting them to spend time with you and other people. Being social and spending time with loved ones has been proven to boost one's mood and help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation. Even if your friend declines your invitation, the gesture can show that you care and are willing to invest time and energy into their well-being. Finally, ask your friend what activities might make them feel better. Depending on their situation, they may have specific hobbies or interests that can bring them joy and peace. Encourage them to pursue these activities as much as possible, and offer to join in if appropriate. By focusing on what brings them happiness, you can help distract them from their problems and provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

Carmen Zarra has revealed that her father, who passed away in 2006, would have appreciated Messi's humility and sportsmanship. Messi has always been praised for his dedication to the game and his modest attitude, something that Zarra would have respected and admired. Furthermore, Carmen Zarra has also shown her preference for Messi over rival Cristiano Ronaldo, another player who has often been compared to her father.

Drink coffee.","completion":"Breathing, sports, and coffee; these might not seem like they have much in common, but they all play a crucial role in improving your physical health. Here are five easy tips that will help boost your physical activity and mental clarity. 1. Take short breaths: Breathing is fundamental to our body's function. However, most of us take shallow breaths instead of breathing deeply, which limits the amount of oxygen our bodies receive. Learning to breathe correctly can help boost energy levels, focus, and overall well-being. Experts suggest taking short and frequent breaths, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, to stimulate the body's oxygen intake. 2. Engage in action sports: Playing action sports such as basketball, football, and soccer are not only fun, but they also provide an intense workout. These sports improve cardiovascular health, build muscle strength, and increase agility. Moreover, studies have shown that engaging in team sports can also improve mental health and build social skills. 3. Try interval training: Interval training involves short, high-intensity workouts followed by periods of rest. This technique is an excellent way to build endurance, increase metabolism, and burn fat. Moreover, it can be done anytime, anywhere. From running on a treadmill to jumping jacks, interval training can be customized to suit every fitness level. 4. Engage in a new form of physical activity: Trying out new physical activities such as rock climbing, dance classes, or martial arts can challenge your body in new ways. Engaging in diverse forms of physical activity helps stretch different muscle groups, improves flexibility, and adds diversity to your workout routine. 5. Drink coffee: The benefits of drinking coffee go beyond mental alertness. Coffee contains antioxidants, which help reduce inflammation in the body. Additionally, caffeine has been shown to improve physical performance and reduce muscle pain after workouts, as well as enhance focus and alertness. In conclusion, the above tips are great ways to improve your overall health and well-being. Whether you take short breaths or engage in a new form of physical activity, every little effort made counts towards leading an active and healthy lifestyle."},{"prompt":"w similar are the following two sentences?

The debate on a new delimitation of the German territory started in 1919 as part of discussions about the new constitution. Hugo Preuss, the father of the Weimar Constitution, drafted a plan to divide the German Reich into 14 roughly equalsized states. His proposal was turned down due to opposition of the states and concerns of the government. Article 18 of the constitution enabled a new delimitation of the German territory but set high hurdles: Three fifth of the votes handed in, and at least the majority of the population are necessary to decide on the alteration of territory. In fact, until 1933 there were only four changes in the configuration of the German states: The 7 Thuringian states were merged in 1920, whereby Coburg opted for Bavaria, Pyrmont joined Prussia in 1922, and Waldeck did so in 1929.

Once this number is established, we can then subtract the number of individuals who are 65 years of age or older from the total number of individuals and then divide that number by the total number of individuals in the group. The resulting number will be the percentage of people who were not 65 years of age or older. For example, if we were studying a group of 100 individuals and 20 of those individuals were 65 years of age or older, we would subtract 20 from 100, which would leave us with 80. Dividing 80 by 100 yields a quotient of 0.8 or 80 percent. This means that 80 percent of the group were not 65 years of age or older. It is important to note that the percentage of people who are not 65 years of age or older in a given group will vary depending on the specific group being studied. In general, however, younger age groups will have a higher percentage of individuals who are not 65 years of age or older, while older age groups will have a lower percentage of individuals who are not 65 years of age or older. In conclusion, to determine the percentage of people who were not 65 years of age or older in a given group, we need to subtract the number of individuals who are 65 years of age or older from the total number of individuals in the group and then divide that number by the total number of individuals in the group.

All four quakes were centered in the same location in Irving, Dallas County, where there have been 20 quakes reported since October 2014, NBC reports. The four quakes—ranging in strength from magnitude 2.7 to 3.6—were centered near the old Texas Stadium site, former home of the Dallas Cowboys, and Southern Methodist University scientists are trying to determine the cause. The United States Geological Survey says the quakes—two of which happened within seconds of each other starting at 8:11pm—were strong enough to break windows and be felt by many people in the area. Researchers say the quakes could be linked to stored stress in old fault lines, although the disposal of wastewater from the energy industry can also trigger small quakes. But there are no oil and gas disposal wells in Dallas County, a seismologist with the Texas Railroad Commission tells the Dallas Morning News. And I see no linkage between oil and gas activity and these recent earthquakes in Irving.

These recent quakes have raised concerns, and experts from Southern Methodist University are investigating the cause.

After vacuuming or scraping, the next step is to blot the stain. This involves using a clean cloth or paper towel to gently press and absorb as much of the stain as possible. It is important not to rub the stain as this can cause it to spread further. Once the stain has been blotted, it is time to apply a commercial stain remover. There are various types of stain removers available in the market, so it is important to choose one that is suitable for the type of stain you are dealing with. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully and apply the stain remover to the affected area. Next, rinse the area thoroughly with clean water to remove any remaining stain remover and residue. This will help to prevent any potential damage to the fabric. Finally, dry the area completely before using the item again. It is important to ensure the area is completely dry to prevent any moisture from causing further damage or attracting more dirt and debris.

Have upbeat weekly family meetings.","completion":"Family is one of the most essential aspects of anyone's life. It is where we all come from, and it shapes who we grow up to be. However, sometimes families can be challenging to navigate, and disagreements or misunderstandings can cause friction. To maintain healthy relationships with your family members, it is crucial to heed some principles. Firstly, it is essential to respect what your family members have to say. Everyone has their own opinions and beliefs, and listening to them will create an environment of mutual respect. Avoid being judgmental or criticizing others, as this only causes further division within the family. Taking the time to actively listen to others is crucial in any relationship, and this is no different in family situations. Active listening allows you to comprehend other people's perspectives and helps in avoiding misunderstandings. Listening, combined with effective communication skills, creates a healthy family dynamic. Expressing love and appreciation for your family is a necessary step in maintaining healthy relationships. You can show love and appreciation through spending quality time, saying kind words, or even small gestures like cooking food or running errands for the elderly family members. These little things can go a long way in strengthening family ties. Many people make the mistake of comparing their family to others they see on social media. It is essential to remember that families are not always perfect and that what is portrayed on social media is not always an accurate depiction of reality. Each family faces its unique set of challenges, and embracing this fact helps in accepting the differences within the family. Finally, having upbeat weekly family meetings can significantly impact family dynamics. These meetings are an opportunity to discuss and find solutions to any issues affecting family unity. It can be a time to catch up and appreciate each other while sharing updates on the family's lives. The importance of healthy family relationships is immeasurable. Incorporating these principles for healthy family relationships is achievable and creates a lifelong bond necessary for emotional support and strong relationships."},{"prompt":"What is the answer to this question? when does monk find out who killed trudy?","completion":"Monk finds out who killed Trudy in the final episode of the series, which is titled \\"Mr. Monk and the End\\"."},{"prompt":"This is an email Document Signature Cash Sale Form Jean Mrha/Julie Gomez Easements Agreement Jean Mrha/Julie Gomez (if needed) DASH Rick Buy/Dave Gorte Jean Mrha/Julie Gomez Mark Haedicke John Lavorato/Louise Kitchen Jeff McMahon/Ray Bowen The DASH may need a legal risk rating attachment, and Gerald can draft that quickly if needed.

The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect which is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and The Hymn to Ninkasi, a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.

Staff also used smartwatches to greet passengers and give information. Edinburgh Airport became the first to issue its staff with smartglasses. Iberia airline has allowed passengers to board planes using smartwatches.","completion":"\\"Smart Technology Revolutionizes Operations in Airports and Airlines\\" Heathrow Airport and Edinburgh Airport have revolutionized passenger services by using smart technology. In February, Heathrow Airport began their trial period which proved to be remarkably successful. Staff utilized smartwatches to greet passengers, provide information about flight schedules, and direct customers to their boarding gate. This method of communication cut down waiting times and enabled quick and efficient communication amongst staff members. Following the trial's success, Edinburgh Airport became the first airport to issue its staff with smart glasses. These glasses use augmented reality technology to provide staff with live flight information and assist in directing passengers around the airport. This innovation ensures that passengers are given the most up-to-date information, easily recognizable staff and an improved overall experience. Iberia Airlines has also joined the trend by allowing their passengers to board planes using smartwatches. This technology allows travelers to scan their boarding passes and access flight information and updates directly from their smartwatch. The use of smartwatches eliminates the need for traditional boarding passes, which reduces waiting times and speeds up check-in processes, creating a more convenient experience for all passengers. Overall, the implementation of smart technology in the aviation industry is undoubtedly improving passenger experiences whilst shortening wait times for vital information. The airport and airline industries have only scratched the surface of possibilities for smart technology going forward, and customers will likely witness the emergence of new smart technology solutions in the future."},{"prompt":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Look no further than the humble wreath. While traditional floral wreaths are always a classic choice, there are plenty of other options out there for those who want something a little more unconventional. Here are four ideas to consider for a wreath that's sure to turn heads. 1. Try a Candy Wreath: If you're looking for a wreath that's as fun as it is festive, a candy wreath might be just the thing. Simply head to your local bulk candy store and pick out an assortment of sweets in different colors and sizes. Then, using a wire wreath frame as your base, attach the candy with floral wire or hot glue. And voila! You've got a wreath that's both playful and delicious. 2. Create a Deco Mesh Wreath: Deco mesh is a versatile material that comes in a variety of colors and textures. To create a deco mesh wreath, start with a wreath form and loop the mesh through it in a pattern of your choosing. You can add ribbons, ornaments, pinecones, or other embellishments as desired. The result is a wreath that's full and bold, with lots of visual interest. 3. Use Non-Floral Items: Who says a wreath has to be made of flowers? Instead, consider using non-floral materials like pinecones or succulents to make your wreath. For a pinecone wreath, start with a Styrofoam wreath form and hot glue the pinecones around it in a circular pattern. For a succulent wreath, use a wire wreath form and attach the plants with floral wire. The result is an earthy and natural wreath that's perfect for winter. 4. Wrap Ribbon or Burlap Around a Styrofoam Wreath: For a simple yet effective wreath, try wrapping a Styrofoam wreath form in ribbon or burlap. You can use any color or pattern you like, depending on your personal style. Then, add embellishments like silk flowers, berries, or ornaments for a finishing touch. This type of wreath is perfect for those who want something understated but still festive. No matter which type of wreath you choose, the result is sure to add a touch of holiday cheer to your home.

Tungsten metal was initially not available in a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires. Filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile. By 1910, a process was developed by William D. Coolidge at General Electric for production of a ductile form of tungsten. The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing. It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small doping treatment with potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments.

Specifically, Fort Ticonderoga fell to the British on July 6, 1758, and the attack on Fort Frontenac took place on August 26, 1758. After their triumph at Fort Ticonderoga, the British continued their campaign to control the strategic waterways and forts along the St. Lawrence River. The capture of Fort Frontenac, located on the eastern end of Lake Ontario, was an essential part of this plan. Led by Sir John Bradstreet, a force of approximately 3,000 British soldiers and Native American allies besieged the French garrison at Fort Frontenac. The French commander, Francois-Charles de Bourlamaque, quickly realized that his position was untenable and surrendered after a brief bombardment of the fort. The capture of Fort Frontenac was a significant victory for the British, as it gave them control of Lake Ontario and a vital supply route into the interior of New France. The fall of Fort Frontenac set the stage for further British advances, including the capture of Fort Niagara in 1759 and ultimately the fall of Quebec in 1760. In conclusion, the British attack on Fort Frontenac took place approximately one month after their victory at Fort Ticonderoga. This swift and decisive action was a critical part of the British campaign to control the waterways and forts of the St. Lawrence River and ultimately secure victory in the French and Indian War."},{"prompt":"Nice local bagel shop, opens at 5:30AM, and not part of a chain which is a big plus.

Number of Americans living where gay marriage legal will likely soon reach 60%, she says. Coontz: More high profile gays in culture; plus civil rights, feminism widened view on social equality. Coontz: Big shifts in concept of equality in heterosexual marriage also helped clear path. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"In the past decade, the United States has experienced a historic shift in attitudes towards same-sex marriage. According to Stephanie Coontz, a professor of history and family studies at Evergreen State College, the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2004 was just the beginning. Since then, the number of Americans living in states where gay marriage is legal has grown rapidly, and is likely to reach 60% soon. There are many factors that have contributed to this rapid change in attitudes. Coontz points to the increased visibility of high profile gays in culture and the widening view on social equality through civil rights and feminism movements. As more and more people have come out as gay or lesbian, they have challenged traditional notions of gender roles and marriage. Moreover, there have been big shifts in the concept of equality in heterosexual relationships as well, as more women have entered the workforce and taken on leadership roles. This has challenged the traditional idea that marriage is an institution in which the man is the dominant partner. Overall, Coontz argues that the growing acceptance of same-sex marriage is part of a broader trend towards greater social equality. As more people recognize the value of diversity and the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity, they are increasingly embracing the idea that love, commitment, and family come in many different forms. While there is still work to be done to ensure that all people have the right to marry the person they love, the progress of the last decade provides hope for a brighter, more inclusive future."},{"prompt":"bluehost is symbolic of superior quality in the hosting industry which is demonstrated by its expanding consumer base and customer retention.

Place the gift in the center of a large sheet of tissue paper and gather the paper around the gift. Then, use some tape or ribbon to secure the tissue paper in place. Another fun way to use tissue paper is to create paper flowers or other decorations. Cut out several layers of tissue paper in your desired shapes and stack them on top of each other. Then, fold the stack of tissue paper back and forth like an accordion and tie a piece of string or wire around the center. Finally, carefully separate the layers of tissue paper and fluff them up to create a full and colorful flower. Of course, tissue paper isn't just for wrapping gifts or making decorations. You can also use it as filler in a gift bag to help hold items in place and add some extra color and texture. Simply crumple up some tissue paper and place it in the bottom of the bag, then layer your gifts on top.

This was Edmund Burke's paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust.

Lee, who spent ten years protecting the leader, witnessed firsthand how Kim dealt with those who displeased him. According to Lee, Kim executed his advisors in public, using anti-aircraft guns to make sure there was nothing left of the body. This display of brutality was meant to instill fear in anyone who dared to cross him. Lee spoke about his experience working for Kim Jong-Il's son, Kim Jong-Un, who succeeded his father as the leader of North Korea. Lee claims that Kim Jong-Un has continued his father's legacy of fear. However, he has managed to create a sense of genuine loyalty among the country's population. This is due to the fact that the people of North Korea have been brainwashed to believe that the Kim family is the only thing standing between them and an invasion by the United States. Lee's experience is a reminder of the brutality that goes on behind the facade of the North Korean regime. It highlights the extent to which Kim Jong-Il went to retain his grip on power, and the lengths to which his son will go to maintain that control. The legacy of fear that Kim Jong-Il left behind still permeates North Korean society, making it one of the most repressive regimes in the world. After escaping to South Korea, Lee Young-Guk took up farming ducks, a far cry from his days as one of Kim Jong-Il's bodyguards. However, he remains a vocal critic of the North Korean regime, using his story to draw attention to the oppression that still exists in the country.

Avoid fidgeting or crossing your arms, as this can signal discomfort or closed-mindedness. Ultimately, the key to using hand gestures effectively is to be natural and authentic in how you use them.

That is, high pitch means very rapid oscillation, and low pitch corresponds to slower oscillation. Despite that, the idiom relating vertical height to sound pitch is shared by most languages. At least in English, it is just one of many deep conceptual metaphors that involve up/down. The exact etymological history of the musical sense of high and low pitch is still unclear. There is evidence that humans do actually perceive that the source of a sound is slightly higher or lower in vertical space when the sound frequency is increased or decreased.

One key element of effective discipline is consistency. Parents should establish clear rules and consequences and enforce them immediately when misbehavior occurs. Consequences should also be powerful enough to discourage repeat offenses. It's important for parents to remain calm and not respond to misbehavior emotionally. Children can be persistent in their attempts to skirt the rules, but parents should not cave in to their demands. Giving attention to bad behavior can also inadvertently reward it, so ignoring the behavior or redirecting the child's attention can be more effective. Communication is also important in effective discipline. Parents should communicate firmly, but not aggressively, to their children about the expectations and consequences of their behavior. Timeouts can also be an effective tool in deescalating problematic behavior. Finally, anticipating problems before they occur can prevent misbehavior altogether.

After the fermentation process is completed, it is essential to know how to properly store the kombucha before serving it. The first step is to cover the jar. This is important because it prevents outside contaminants, such as dust and insects, from getting inside the jar and ruining the taste of your kombucha. Moreover, the cover helps maintain the carbonation of the kombucha, which makes it fizzy and enjoyable to drink. Next, it's crucial to place the jar out of direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can cause the kombucha to spoil, degrade the flavor, and cause unwanted changes in the composition of the drink. Therefore, it's best to store the jar in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, and with a stable temperature. When it comes to storing the kombucha, it's important to keep the scoby out of it. The scoby is the culture of bacteria and yeast that is used to ferment the kombucha. After the fermentation process is completed, you should remove the scoby and store it separately. You can keep the scoby in a sealed jar or a plastic container with some of the kombucha liquid covering it. This way, the scoby will continue to ferment, and you can use it to make more kombucha in the future. In conclusion, proper storage is a crucial step to ensure that your kombucha remains delicious and safe to consume. Always remember to cover the jar, store it out of direct sunlight, and store the scoby separately. By following these simple steps, you can enjoy your homemade kombucha for days, weeks, and even months to come."},{"prompt":"BellSouth Posts Lower Earnings WASHINGTON (Reuters) BellSouth Corp. &lt;A HREF=http://www.investor.reuters.com/FullQuote.aspx?ticker=BLS.N target=/stocks/quickinfo/fullquote&gt;BLS.N&lt;/A&gt; on Monday said thirdquarter earnings fell due to hurricane damage in the southeastern U.S. What is this text about?

This move will allow California to seek federal aid to mitigate the impact of the drought. The state is facing several challenges as a wildfire rages near Los Angeles, claiming five homes. Agricultural and farming areas as well as urban areas are facing dire consequences if the state does not prepare for the drought. One of the most visible signs of the drought is the low level of the Folsom Reservoir near Sacramento. The water level is so low that the remains of a Gold Rush-era ghost town, flooded to create the lake in the 1950s, are visible for the first time in years. This is a clear indication of just how severe the drought is. The drought is not just affecting the environment and historical sites, but it also has economic implications. The agricultural sector is one of the most affected, with farmers experiencing significant losses in crop yields. This, in turn, affects food prices and availability. Urban areas are also facing water shortages, which can lead to rationing and water cuts. California's water management system needs to be evaluated to ensure that it can withstand future droughts. The state needs to focus on water conservation and management to ensure that water resources are optimized. The declaration of a drought emergency will hopefully result in federal aid to support these efforts. In conclusion, the severity of the drought in California cannot be understated. The impacts are far-reaching, affecting the environment, historical sites, and the economy. It is essential that the state and federal government work together to develop long-term solutions to address these challenges."},{"prompt":"What's an example of a movie review?","completion":"\\"Joker,\\" directed by Todd Phillips, is a dark and haunting portrayal of one man's descent into madness.

This angered the Kingdom of Serbia and its patron, the PanSlavic and Orthodox Russian Empire. Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the powder keg of Europe. In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the 33day Second Balkan War, further destabilising the region. The Great Powers were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.
