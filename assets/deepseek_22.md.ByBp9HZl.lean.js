At each interface, depending on the impedance match, some fraction of the wave's energy will reflect back to the source, forming a standing wave in the feed line. The ratio of maximum power to minimum power in the wave can be measured and is called the standing wave ratio (SWR). A SWR of 1:1 is ideal. A SWR of 1.5:1 is considered to be marginally acceptable in low power applications where power loss is more critical, although an SWR as high as 6:1 may still be usable with the right equipment.

Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earthbased telescopes.

During his long career, Brees has thrown many touchdown passes, ranging from short ones that barely cross the goal line to long bombs that travel over 50 yards in the air. So how many more yards was Brees' longest touchdown pass than his shortest one? To answer this question, we need to look at Brees' career stats and determine the range of his touchdown passes. According to pro-football-reference.com, Brees has thrown 571 touchdown passes in his career as of the end of the 2020 season. His shortest touchdown pass was a 1-yard toss to tight end Michael Hoomanawanui in a game against the Detroit Lions on December 4, 2016. His longest touchdown pass was a 98-yard bomb to receiver Devery Henderson in a game against the Washington Redskins on November 15, 2009. So how many more yards was Brees' longest touchdown pass than his shortest one? The answer is 97 yards. This is because you simply subtract the yardage of the shortest touchdown pass (1 yard) from the yardage of the longest touchdown pass (98 yards), which gives you the difference of 97 yards. In conclusion, Drew Brees' longest touchdown pass was 97 yards more than his shortest touchdown pass.

Alliss says the BBC can‚Äôt compete with Sky‚Äôs superior spending power. The British Open could be shown on the satellite channel from 2016. Insiders in Abu Dhabi believe the deal will be confirmed soon.","completion":"Peter Alliss, the iconic golf commentator, has recently expressed his sadness over the possibility of Sky taking over broadcasting rights of The Open from the BBC. According to Alliss, the BBC simply cannot compete with the massive spending power of Sky. Sky, the UK-based satellite television provider, is reportedly in talks to broadcast The Open, one of golf‚Äôs four major championships, starting in 2016. This news has sent shockwaves through the golfing world, with many fans and insiders expressing concern over the potential impact on the sport. Alliss, who has been a commentator for the BBC‚Äôs coverage of The Open for more than 50 years, spoke out about the issue in an interview with The Telegraph. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sadness, really, that the BBC can‚Äôt compete money-wise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way of the world, unfortunately. It‚Äôs the way everything is going, and the BBC can‚Äôt afford to compete with Sky.‚Äù The potential deal is said to be worth around ¬£10 million per year, and many insiders in Abu Dhabi, where the negotiations are taking place, believe that it will be confirmed soon. This could mean that The Open will no longer be available to millions of viewers who rely on the BBC to broadcast the event. The impact of this potential change remains to be seen, but it is clear that many in the golfing community are worried about the future of the sport. Some have suggested that Sky‚Äôs coverage may be too commercialized and focused on the big names in the sport, rather than the more traditional elements that are celebrated by the BBC‚Äôs coverage. As golf continues to grow in popularity around the world, it seems likely that these kinds of debates about broadcasting rights and coverage will become more common. But for now, it remains to be seen whether Sky will take over The Open, and what impact that will have on the future of the sport."},{"prompt":"This is some data: The Golden Palace eatType coffee shop; The Golden Palace priceRange moderate; The Golden Palace customer rating 3 out of 5.

Knock the dirt off of each bulb with your hands. Trim away the roots with shears or scissors. Select a warm, dry location to dry your garlic out. Hang your garlic bulbs up or leave them out on the table. Wait 1014 days for your garlic to completely dry out.","completion":"Garlic Harvesting and Drying Tips for Home Gardeners Harvesting garlic is a satisfying task for home gardeners who want to enjoy the fresh and pungent flavor of this beloved seasoning in their culinary creations. Garlic is ready to harvest after 6-8 months of growth, typically in late summer or early fall, when the lower leaves start to dry out and turn yellow or brown. At this stage, the bulbs have formed and matured, and the papery skin layers surrounding the cloves have begun to thicken. To harvest garlic, gently loosen the soil around each bulb with a digging fork or trowel, being careful not to damage the bulb or the stem. Then, pull the bulb out of the soil by grasping the stem near the base and lifting it up. You can also use a hoe or rake to remove the soil around multiple plants at once. Once you have harvested your garlic bulbs, it's time to prepare them for storage. Start by knocking off any large clumps of dirt with your hands or a soft brush, but avoid washing the bulbs, as exposure to water can increase the risk of mold and rot. Next, use a clean pair of shears or scissors to trim away the roots, leaving about ¬Ω inch of stem attached to the bulb. After trimming the bulbs, choose a warm, dry location to dry them out for several weeks. You can either hang them up by their stems in a cool, airy place with good ventilation, or lay them out on a clean, dry surface like a table or wire rack. Make sure to avoid direct sunlight or high humidity, as these conditions can also lead to spoilage. Allow the garlic to dry for 10-14 days, or until the outer skin layers are dry and papery to the touch. You can test the dryness by gently squeezing one of the bulbs - if the skin feels papery and the cloves sound firm inside, they are ready for storage. Finally, store the garlic bulbs in a cool, dry place with good air circulation, such as a cupboard, pantry, or basement. Properly stored garlic can last for several months, providing a flavorful addition to your kitchen creations throughout the year."},{"prompt":"Write a sentence about the following things: beach, bench, hill, overlook","completion":"The beach has a bench overlooking the hill."},{"prompt":"A conjectural portrait is a portrait made of a historical figure for whom no authentic contemporary portrait is available.

If you are primarily focused on improving your diet, then you may prefer an app that is designed for tracking your nutrition intake and helping you to make healthier choices. Alternatively, if you are more focused on your physical fitness, you may prefer an app that tracks your workouts and helps you to stay motivated. Once you have decided on your focus, it is important to consider finding an app with specialty items. Some apps are designed to cater to specific dietary needs, such as vegan, gluten-free, or low-carb diets. Others may have specialized workout routines or features, such as yoga or meditation programs. Choosing an app that caters to your specific needs and preferences can make your tracking experience much more enjoyable and effective. Another important factor to consider when choosing an app is to review ratings and reviews. Reading feedback from other users can help you gain insights into the app's usability, reliability, and effectiveness. Look for apps with high ratings and positive reviews, as these are more likely to provide a well-rounded tracking experience. Finally, it is important to determine a budget. While some apps may be free to download, others may require a subscription or a one-time purchase. By determining your budget upfront, you can narrow down your options and avoid overspending on an app that may not be the best fit for you. In conclusion, choosing the right app for tracking food, fitness or both can be a simple process if you follow these guidelines. By deciding on your focus, finding an app with specialty items, reviewing ratings and reviews, and determining your budget, you can select an app that will help you to achieve your goals and track your progress effectively."},{"prompt":"Check rates and availability for Outside Surf Hostel.

Previous hypotheses emphasized that photosensitive proteins and circadian rhythms may have originated together in the earliest cells, with the purpose of protecting replicating DNA from high levels of damaging ultraviolet radiation during the daytime. As a result, replication was relegated to the dark. However, evidence for this is lacking, since the simplest organisms with a circadian rhythm, the cyanobacteria, do the opposite of this they divide more in the daytime. Recent studies instead highlight the importance of coevolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the Great Oxidation Event approximately 2.3 billion years ago. The current view is that circadian changes in environmental oxygen levels and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of daylight are likely to have driven a need to evolve circadian rhythms to preempt, and therefore counteract, damaging redox reactions on a daily basis.

Average hotel room costs just ¬£25 a day to stay operational. Staff don't want a fight so will back down over mini bar 'discrepancies' The front desk is authorised to upgrade guests on special occasions. You'll get the worst room in the house if you booked through discount sites. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The hotel industry is notoriously competitive and can bring some surprises for those who are not in the know. To shed some light on the situation, former front desk employee Jacob Tomsky has come forward with some revelations. One of the most interesting insights shared by Tomsky is that the average hotel room costs just ¬£25 a day to stay operational. This is something that should make hotel guests think twice about paying full price for a room. That being said, the costs of running a hotel can vary depending on its location, brand and target market. According to Tomsky, staff at hotels often don't want confrontation and will often back down over mini bar 'discrepancies'. This is particularly interesting given the exorbitant prices one can find in the mini bar. It's important for guests to be aware of this before making any purchase decisions. The front desk is also authorised to upgrade guests on special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries. This may come as a surprise for some, but it's not uncommon for hotels to have a few premium rooms available to upgrade guests to as a goodwill gesture. If you're booking a room for a special occasion, it might be worth mentioning it at the front desk to see if they can do anything for you. Finally, if you've booked through discount sites, you might be getting the worst room in the house. Tomsky notes that hotels often reserve the smallest, least desirable rooms for those who book through third-party discount websites. This is something to keep in mind if you're not willing to take the risk. All in all, these insights into the hotel industry are eye-opening and should serve as a reminder to guests to be aware of what they're paying for. While some of these practices may seem underhanded, it's important to remember that hotels are in the business of making a profit, and guests should always try and get the most value for their money."},{"prompt":"Data: The Cambridge Blue eatType restaurant; The Cambridge Blue food English; The Cambridge Blue customer rating low What would a sentence about this data be like?","completion":"The Cambridge Blue is a restaurant that serves mainly English food and has a low customer rating."},{"prompt":"The company asks federal regulators to approve the paperwork required for its stock sale.

These individuals may be further radicalized while behind bars, leading to them becoming more extreme in their beliefs and potentially carrying out violent acts once they are released. The potential consequences of this new wave of radicalization cannot be overlooked. It is clear that measures need to be put in place to prevent individuals from becoming radicalized while in prison. This could involve providing inmates with access to education and support programs that aim to counter extremist ideologies. It is also important to ensure that staff working in prisons are properly trained to identify signs of radicalization and extremism. This will enable them to take appropriate action and prevent radicalized individuals from spreading their beliefs to others. Ultimately, it is essential that the issue of prison radicalization is taken seriously.

The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or more closely related to the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linn√© (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or twopart naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus.

The solar system comprises personal planets- Mercury, Venus, Mars; and the outer planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Personal planets represent aspects of our personality and affect us on a personal level, while the outer planets represent collective energy and affect us universally. To interpret planets, it is essential to know which house they occupy, ranging from the first to the twelfth house, each of which represents different aspects of an individual's life. The signs the planets are in offer additional information concerning the planet's influence and the mode of expression. There are twelve astrological signs in the zodiac, each of which corresponds with one of the four classical elements, fire, earth, air, and water. Interpreting planets is an effective tool for self-discovery and understanding. It allows individuals to recognize and appreciate their strengths and weaknesses better, and helps them comprehend their interactions with others. Astrology serves as a unique tool that encourages one's self-growth and discovery."},{"prompt":"ere is a question about this article: Shortterm memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication, dependent on regions of the frontal lobe (especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and the parietal lobe. Longterm memory, on the other hand, is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain. The hippocampus is essential (for learning new information) to the consolidation of information from shortterm to longterm memory, although it does not seem to store information itself.

This move comes as ISIS has taken control of dozens of villages in the area, prompting a Kurdish activist to state that this is about defending the lives of 50,000 Kurds from a potential massacre. Turkey also opened its border to tens of thousands of Kurdish refugees fleeing the violence in the region. The situation in Kobani is particularly dire, and the involvement of Turkish Kurds in the fight against ISIS highlights the complex political and ethnic tensions in the region.

One of the changes includes the possibility of a presidential visit to the island nation. While the White House didn't confirm whether or not a visit would take place, the fact that it hasn't been ruled out marks a significant shift in diplomatic relations between the two countries. For decades, the U.S. and Cuba were at odds due to political ideology and tensions that arose during the Cold War. However, President Obama has been working to improve relations since 2014, when he announced plans to re-establish diplomatic ties with Cuba. Despite President Obama's efforts, there have been numerous obstacles hindering progress. One of the main challenges has been the U.S. embargo, which prevents American companies from doing business in Cuba. The embargo, which was first put in place in the 1960s, has had a significant impact on the Cuban economy. However, President Obama has been chipping away at the embargo by easing certain travel and business restrictions. President Obama has also called on Congress to lift the embargo entirely, citing the fact that it has not been effective in achieving its intended purpose. While there has been some pushback from lawmakers who believe that loosening the embargo will only strengthen the Castro regime, others believe that it is time to reevaluate U.S.-Cuban relations in the 21st century. The possibility of a presidential visit to Cuba is a clear indication that the U.S. is serious about improving relations with its island neighbor. While it remains to be seen whether or not a visit will actually take place, the fact that it is being considered is a promising sign. As diplomatic ties between the two countries continue to improve, it is likely that there will be further announcements and changes in the coming weeks and months. It will be interesting to see how these changes impact both the U.S. and Cuba, and what the future holds for these two countries."},{"prompt":"Write a positive movie review.","completion":"The newly released movie \\"Soul\\" is absolutely exceptional.

It is a combination of an exhaustdriven turbocharger and an enginedriven supercharger, each mitigating the weaknesses of the other.

When combined with a large turbocharger if the \`\`turbo'' was used by itself, it would offer unacceptable lag and poor response in the lowrpm range the proper combination of the two can offer a zerolag powerband with high torque at lower engine speeds and increased power at the higher end.

The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds begins well. Actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well. But even a big Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable. For those who don't know, the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them. But even with a change to nearly every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74 version that made it great. The one in this version is watered down, only 10 minutes, and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase. Where the original chase was very believable, the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt, the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase film, fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake.

Rebel fighters, wearing balaclavas and carrying assault rifles and ammunition, have pledged to punish any tribesman who try to drive them out of the city. The Iraqi army has deployed tanks and artillery ahead of a planned military assault. The situation in Fallujah has been deteriorating for some time, as rebel groups have taken control of the city and refused to relinquish it to the Iraqi government. Reports suggest that Islamist militants linked to Al-Qaeda have been among the groups involved in the fighting. While the exact number of rebel fighters involved in the takeover is unclear, eyewitnesses have reported seeing scores of heavily-armed militants moving through the streets of the city. The rebels have established checkpoints and are actively patrolling the area, with some reports indicating that they have taken over key government buildings and facilities. The situation has prompted a response from the Iraqi army, which has deployed tanks and artillery to the area in readiness for a military assault. However, there is growing concern that any attack could result in a significant loss of life, given the number of civilians still in the city. The current crisis in Fallujah has deep roots, as the city has a long history of insurgency and opposition to Iraqi government control. The city was the site of some of the bloodiest fighting during the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and has remained a focal point for sectarian violence in the years since. As the situation in Fallujah continues to unfold, there are fears that the fighting could spread to other parts of Iraq, exacerbating the country's already fragile security situation. While the Iraqi government has promised to take all necessary measures to regain control of the city, the extent of the violence and the resistance put up by the rebels remains unclear."},{"prompt":"As economic and demographic methods were applied to the study of history, the trend was increasingly to see the late Middle Ages as a period of recession and crisis.

Pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man who needs to release the female part of his being by crossdressing on occasions. He transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion. Julie Walters is magnificent, is as her habit, as the landlady who teaches him unconditional love.

West Antarctica was partially in the Northern Hemisphere, and during this period large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited.

By the start of the Devonian period (416 Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Ma), as Gondwana became centered on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as Glossopteris, a pteridosperm which grew in swamps.

Use a new needle.","completion":"When it comes to sewing jeans, there are some important steps that one must take to ensure the best results. The first step is to wash the jeans before doing any sewing. This is especially important if the jeans are new, as there may be excess dye or shrinkage that can affect the final fit of the jeans. Another crucial step is to use a new needle when sewing jeans. The thickness and density of denim can be tough on needles, especially if the jeans are made of thicker denim. A new needle will ensure that the stitches are even and will minimize the risk of the needle breaking or becoming dull in the middle of the sewing process. By washing the jeans first and using a new needle, you can ensure that your sewing project results in a high-quality finish. These small steps may seem insignificant, but they can make a huge difference in the final product.

Many Palestinians now see a \\"one-state solution\\" as the only viable option.

The botanical term Angiosperm, from the Ancient Greek Œ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒØŒøŒΩ, ange√≠on (bottle, vessel) and œÉœÄŒ≠œÅŒºŒ±, (seed), was coined in the form Angiospermae by Paul Hermann in 1690, as the name of one of his primary divisions of the plant kingdom.

Search at night or on rainy days.","completion":"The salamander is a fascinating amphibian that can easily be found in its natural habitat with a little bit of patience and knowledge. Visiting the salamander's home requires some preparation and understanding of the animal's behavior and environment. Firstly, it is important to know what to look for when searching for salamanders. They can be found in a variety of colors and patterns, so if you are unsure, a guidebook or knowledgeable local can be of great help. They are typically found in damp areas such as streams, ponds, and wetlands. Spring is the ideal time of the year to search for salamanders. This is because they usually emerge from their underground hiding places and are active during this season. They like to bask on warm rocky surfaces during the day and then start their hunt for food in the evening. When searching for salamanders, keep an eye out for edge environments. These are locations where two different types of land meet, such as a forest and a meadow, which provide great hunting grounds for salamanders. They can hide under rotting logs, stones, and in ground burrows. To successfully spot salamanders, it is also essential to look for their food sources like worms, insects, and spiders. They are mostly active at night or on rainy days, so visiting during these times will increase chances of finding them. In conclusion, visiting the salamander's home can be a fun and rewarding experience. With knowledge and patience, you can successfully spot and observe these fascinating creatures.
