She cites changed gender roles, raised expectations for financial stability in marriage. Coontz: Widening economic gap in U.S. is reflected in marriage gap. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"In a recent study, 40 percent of adults surveyed stated that they believe marriage is becoming obsolete. This statistic seems to contradict the fact that a majority of those surveyed still express a desire to get married. Sociologist Stephanie Coontz has asked, why the disconnect? Coontz suggests that changing gender roles and increased expectations for financial stability in marriage may be contributing to this phenomenon. Traditionally, men were expected to be the primary breadwinners in a marriage. However, as more women enter the workforce and become financially independent, the dynamics of marriage have changed. Today, both partners are often expected to contribute financially, which can create tension and unequal distribution of responsibilities. Furthermore, with the rising cost of living, many people may feel that they cannot afford to get married. The expectation of owning a home and having financial stability before tying the knot may deter many from pursuing marriage. The widening economic gap in the United States is also reflected in the marriage gap. According to Coontz, those with higher incomes and higher education levels are more likely to get and stay married. Meanwhile, those with lower incomes and education levels are less likely to enter into marriage or experience divorce. It is essential to recognize the evolving nature of marriage and the changing expectations that come with it. While the desire to get married may still be prevalent, the barriers to doing so are becoming increasingly complex. As society continues to evolve and adapt, it is crucial to address these challenges and create a future where everyone has access to stable, fulfilling relationships regardless of financial circumstances."},{"prompt":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: Daughter of Niels Andersen and Frederikke Rhr","completion":"Daughter of Niels Andersen and Frederikke Rhr."},{"prompt":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to persuade your parents to let you go out on your own Talk to your parents more often.

Try a homemade remedy.","completion":"Copper and sulfur, two elemental substances with natural antimicrobial properties, have been utilized for centuries to treat a variety of diseases. Copper compounds have been used to treat common plant and livestock ailments, while sulfur has been effective against serious bacterial and fungal infections. One popular way to use copper for plant disease prevention is by creating a Bordeaux mixture. This mixture, typically made from copper sulfate, lime, and water, can be sprayed on plants to prevent fungal diseases such as black spot, downy mildew, and leaf blights. The mixture is especially effective on grapes, tomatoes, and potatoes. Copper compounds can also be used to treat common livestock diseases such as foot rot and mastitis. Copper sulfate can be added to feed or water sources to help prevent and treat these ailments. For serious infections in humans, sulfur can be a helpful remedy. Sulfur has antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties that make it an effective treatment for conditions such as acne, ringworm, and toenail fungus. Sulfur can be applied topically in the form of creams or gels, or taken orally as a supplement. While copper and sulfur can be effective treatments, it’s important to note that they should be used wisely and in appropriate doses. Overuse of copper can lead to toxic buildup in the soil, and excessive use of sulfur can cause skin irritation and other adverse effects. For those interested in natural remedies, there are a variety of homemade preparations that can be tried. For example, a tea made from eucalyptus leaves can help relieve cold and flu symptoms, while ginger tea can be effective for upset stomachs. It’s important to do thorough research and consult with a healthcare provider before trying any homemade remedies. In conclusion, copper and sulfur can be powerful tools for treating a variety of common diseases. By using them responsibly and in appropriate doses, we can harness the power of these natural substances to promote health and wellness. Additionally, exploring homemade remedies can be a fun and effective way to treat minor ailments in a natural way."},{"prompt":"he malaysian securities commission lrb msc rrb will be amending the guidelines on unit trust funds to allow offerings to be made in foreign currencies .

However, many people often overlook the expiration date or shelf life of cheese, putting themselves at risk of foodborne illness. Here are some general guidelines on how long you should keep different types of cheese. For unrefrigerated cheese, it is recommended to toss it after two days. This is because unrefrigerated cheese is not only susceptible to bacteria but also to mold. Leaving it out for too long may cause it to spoil or become contaminated, which can lead to food poisoning. On the other hand, refrigerated cheese can last for up to three to four weeks, depending on the type of cheese. However, it is always best to check the expiration date printed on the packaging to ensure that it is safe to eat. Certain kinds of cheese, such as soft cheeses like Brie or Camembert, have a shorter shelf life and should be eaten within one to two weeks of opening. Frozen cheese is also an option to extend its shelf life. However, it is important to note that the texture and flavor may be altered once thawed. Frozen cheese should be used within six months to ensure its quality. In conclusion, knowing when to throw out cheese is crucial in maintaining food safety and preventing foodborne illness.

As their owner, it is important to ensure that your feathered friend's physical and psychological needs are properly addressed. Here are some tips for taking care of your parakeet and building trust with him. First and foremost, make sure your bird's physical needs are met. This includes providing him with a spacious cage with adequate room for flying and exercising. The cage should also have perches of varied sizes and textures to promote foot health and prevent boredom. Fresh water and food should be readily available at all times, and the cage should be cleaned regularly to maintain hygiene. Moreover, making your parakeet feel safe in his environment is crucial to his well-being. Place the cage in a quiet and secure area of the house, away from extreme temperatures, drafts, and direct sunlight. Covering the cage at night can also give your bird a sense of security and help regulate his sleeping habits. Aside from these basic needs, parakeets also love to play and interact with their human companions. Provide your bird with a variety of toys that cater to his chewing, shredding, and perching instincts. These can include wooden blocks, bells, ladders, swings, and mirrors. Rotation and replacement of toys every few weeks can keep the bird engaged and prevent boredom. Encouraging your parakeet to trust you is another essential aspect of pet ownership. Start by sitting calmly and quietly near the cage, talking softly to your bird and offering him treats. Gradually increase your proximity to the cage and eventually open the door to allow the bird to come out on his own terms. Avoid making sudden movements or loud noises that can startle the bird, and be patient as building trust takes time and consistency. In summary, taking care of your parakeet involves meeting his physical needs, providing him a sense of safety, offering him stimulating toys, and building trust through gradual interactions. By attending to these aspects of pet care, you can enjoy a fulfilling and healthy relationship with your feathered companion."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question.

For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable.

While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected.

The Goma Airport was abandoned in 2002 due to the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo that covered the runway with lava. Since then, the planes have remained untouched, gradually rusting away in the African sun. The presence of the planes has provided an unusual source of amusement for local street children, who are often forced to grow up too quickly. The children's knowledge of the plane parts has allowed them to sell them effectively to interested buyers. Brown's photographs offer a glimpse into the lives of these children, who have to fend for themselves in a city that has been marred by war and genocide. Goma's recent history has indeed been dominated by the horrors of war and genocide. The Rwandan Genocide of 1994 and the First and Second Congo Wars have both had a lasting impact on the city. The struggles of the Congolese people have been captured through Brown's lens, who has managed to convey their resilience and spirit even in the face of adversity. In conclusion, Michael Christopher Brown's photographs of Goma Airport and the Congolese street children have proven to be breathtaking and thought-provoking.

This was the team's first Super Bowl win in franchise history. Belichick and the Patriots would go to win two more Super Bowls in the next three years, cementing their status as one of the greatest dynasties in NFL history. Belichick inherited a talented team when he took over as head coach, but it was far from a championship-caliber squad. The Patriots had made the playoffs just once in the previous six years, and there were questions about the team's quarterback situation after franchise icon Drew Bledsoe suffered a season-ending injury early in the 2001 season. Despite these challenges, Belichick quickly established himself as a master strategist and motivator, leading the Patriots to a surprising 11-5 record and a berth in the playoffs. In the postseason, the team upset the heavily-favored Oakland Raiders in a controversial game that featured the famous \\"Tuck Rule\\" play. The Patriots then went on to stun the heavily-favored St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI, with a game-winning drive orchestrated by young quarterback Tom Brady. The Patriots' victory in Super Bowl XXXVI was a validation of Belichick's coaching acumen and set the stage for a run of dominance that would last for years. With Belichick at the helm, the Patriots would win two more Super Bowls in the next three seasons, finishing the 2003 and 2004 campaigns as champions. In total, Belichick would lead the Patriots to six Super Bowl victories during his time as head coach, making him one of the most successful coaches in NFL history.

In essence, a reducción was a colonial town that facilitated the Catholic Church's missionary work and the Spanish Empire's efforts to consolidate its control over indigenous populations. The concept of reducciones was initially proposed by Jesuit missionaries who wanted to create Christian communities that were separate from indigenous settlements. The Spanish authorities eventually adopted the policy, and it became an integral part of colonial governance in the Americas. Some of the earliest reducciones were established in what is now Bolivia, Peru, and Paraguay. For example, San Ignacio de Loyola was founded in 1576 in what is now eastern Paraguay. The town was home to the Guarani people, and it quickly became an important center of missionary activity. Another early reducción was established in Juli, Peru, in 1565. The town was originally known as San Juan de Letrán, but it was renamed after the Jesuit patron saint. Juli became an important center for art and architecture, and it is still known for its colonial-era buildings and artwork. Other notable reducciones from this period include Cuzco, Peru, and Asunción, Paraguay. In each case, the establishment of a reducción represented a significant transformation for the indigenous communities involved. They were forced to adapt to a new way of life that was dictated by the Spanish Empire and the Catholic Church. Despite the challenges and controversies associated with the policy of reducciones, these early colonial towns played a pivotal role in shaping the history of Latin America. They represent a fascinating intersection of colonial power, religion, and cultural exchange."},{"prompt":"Please add spaces between words: Japanesemassage,bathroom,massage,bath,asslicking,Japanese,teen(18+)","completion":"Japanese massage, bathroom, massage, bath, ass licking, Japanese, teen (18+)"},{"prompt":"Add spaces: Description:ChibaWorkoutWristguardIItrainingglove","completion":"Description: Chiba Workout Wristguard II training gloves."},{"prompt":"Question: What would happen if a lower court refused to uphold a constitutional law?

Imagine being the first moth that can blend into its background. It would have a better chance of survival. A living thing that survives is likely to have offspring. If it does, it may pass the new trait on to its offspring. Thats good news for the offspring. The offspring may be more likely to survive. Mutations are one way living things adapt to new conditions.

Its metaphysics includes the concept of māyā and ātman. Māyā connotes that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal. The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be. The concept of ātman is of soul, self within each person, each living being. Advaita Vedantins assert that ātman is same as Brahman, and this Brahman is within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence. They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. Jīvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Selfknowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.

VanConett had a license to carry a concealed weapon, but unfortunately for him, his employer prohibits employees from bringing weapons into the store. As a result of VanConett's actions, he was fired from his job, even though he had only intended to protect himself and his co-workers from harm. While it is understandable that 7-Eleven has policies in place to ensure the safety of customers and employees, it is unfortunate that VanConett's attempt to act heroically resulted in the loss of his job. Many people are divided on the issue of whether or not employers have the right to prohibit their employees from carrying weapons. On the one hand, companies have the duty to protect their workers and customers, and they may feel that allowing weapons onto the premises could lead to dangerous situations. On the other hand, individuals who hold licenses to carry concealed weapons may feel that it is their right to carry them at all times, in order to protect themselves and others. In this particular case, it seems that VanConett had good intentions, but unfortunately, his actions led to his dismissal. It is important for employees to be aware of their company's policies regarding weapons, and to follow them accordingly, even if they are licensed to carry. Ultimately, the question of whether or not employers have the right to prohibit weapons on their premises is a controversial one, and it will likely continue to be debated in the years to come. What is clear, however, is that violating such policies can have serious consequences, as Robert VanConett unfortunately learned the hard way."},{"prompt":"Chinese shares close lower Wednesday Generate a new sentence that is, on a scale from 0 to 5, a 2 in textual similarity to the above sentence.","completion":"China's stock market finishes down for the day on Wednesday."},{"prompt":"@Support@ 1877#778#89.69 Dell Technical support Phone Number?

Appear to make light of dogs being taught to drive in real life in New Zealand.","completion":"The Amazing Creatures blog recently caused controversy when they posted pictures that appeared to show dogs driving cars. Many people were outraged, claiming that the post made light of the serious issue of dogs being taught to drive in real life in New Zealand. While many people found the pictures amusing, others argued that they were in poor taste. Animal rights activists in particular were outraged, claiming that the post reinforced the stereotype of dogs being little more than playthings for their human owners. Many argued that this kind of behavior was irresponsible, and put both the dogs and other drivers on the road at risk. Despite the controversy, there have been reports of dogs being taught to drive in New Zealand in recent months. While some have criticized these efforts as being cruel and inhumane, others have argued that it is a necessary step in helping dogs maintain their independence and freedom. Regardless of one's opinion on the issue, there is no doubt that the pictures posted on the Amazing Creatures blog were intended to generate clicks and buzz, rather than to make a serious statement about animal welfare. However, many people believe that this kind of behavior is irresponsible, and ultimately does more harm than good for both dogs and humans. As such, it is important to be cautious when posting about sensitive topics like animal rights, and to always consider the impact of our words and actions on those around us."},{"prompt":"Rate the similarity of the following two sentences on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is no meaning overlap and 5 is means the same thing?

With just a few simple steps, you can transform your curtains from drab to fab. Here's how to dye your curtains at home: Step 1: Fill a large tub with hot water Start by filling a large tub with hot water. Make sure the tub is big enough to comfortably fit your curtains. Step 2: Prepare the dye Choose a dye that's designed specifically for the type of fabric your curtains are made of. Follow the instructions on the dye package to prepare the dye. This typically involves mixing the dye with hot water and stirring until dissolved. Step 3: Mix in the dye Once you've prepared the dye, pour it into the tub of hot water. Use a wooden spoon or stick to stir the dye into the water. Step 4: Soak the curtains Carefully place your curtains in the dye bath. Use your hands to swirl the curtains around in the water, making sure they're fully submerged. Step 5: Add salt or vinegar Depending on the type of dye you're using, you may need to add salt or vinegar to the water. Check the dye package instructions to see if this is necessary. Salt is often used for natural fibers like cotton, while vinegar is used for synthetic fabrics like polyester. Step 6: Soak for several hours Let your curtains soak in the dye bath for several hours. Check on them periodically to ensure they're getting even coverage. The longer you let them soak, the darker the color will be. Step 7: Rinse and dry Once your curtains have soaked for the desired amount of time, remove them from the dye bath and rinse them thoroughly with cool water.

Cao Qin's coup took place during the late Han Dynasty in the year 196 CE, when he successfully overthrew the reigning emperor in a bid for power. Hong you lu, on the other hand, is a famous novel written during the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from 1368 to 1644 CE. The novel is set in the early years of the Ming Dynasty, around the year 1573. Assuming that the events in Hong you lu are set in the year 1573, and that the Ming Dynasty began in 1368 CE, it can be estimated that approximately 205 years have elapsed since the start of the Ming Dynasty. Subtracting this from the year 1573, it can be estimated that approximately 1368 - 1573 - 205 years have elapsed between the start of the Ming Dynasty and the events in Hong you lu. However, determining the exact year of Cao Qin's coup is more challenging, as historical records are imprecise and there is some debate over the exact dating of events during this period. Some scholars believe that the coup may have taken place in the year 194 or 195 CE, while others suggest that it may have occurred as late as 200 CE.

He was hospitalized for ricin exposure after it was found in hotel room. His cousin is charged with failing to report production and possession.","completion":"Roger Bergendorff, a 57-year-old man, has been charged with possession of a toxin and firearms in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bergendorff was hospitalized for ricin exposure after it was found in his hotel room. His cousin, Thomas Tholen, has also been charged with failing to report the production and possession of the toxin. The discovery of the toxin in Bergendorff's hotel room caused an evacuation of the hotel and a hazardous materials response. Ricin is a deadly poison that can be made from castor beans. It can cause respiratory and organ failure in victims, leading to death. The possession of ricin is illegal under federal law. Bergendorff had been living in the hotel room for several weeks before the discovery of the toxin. He was found unconscious and suffering from respiratory distress when authorities entered his room. He was taken to the hospital and placed in a medically-induced coma. The investigation into Bergendorff's possession of the toxin led authorities to his cousin, Tholen. Tholen admitted to helping Bergendorff produce the toxin in his home and his garage. Tholen also admitted to possessing a handgun, ammunition, and a stolen shotgun. Tholen's failure to report the production and possession of the toxin is a serious crime that can result in a prison sentence of up to five years. Bergendorff's possession of the toxin and firearms is also a serious crime that will be punished accordingly. The possession of illegal toxins and firearms is a dangerous and illegal activity that puts the public's safety at risk. The penalties for these crimes are severe and should serve as a warning to others who may consider engaging in similar activities. In conclusion, the charges against Bergendorff and Tholen serve as a reminder that the possession of toxins and firearms is illegal and potentially deadly. The public must remain vigilant, and law enforcement agencies must continue to investigate and prosecute those who engage in these dangerous activities."},{"prompt":"What would be an example of an positive review?","completion":"An example of a positive review is: \\"I had an amazing experience at this restaurant!

The first of these were local apothecaries that expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the mid 1800s.

The Detjens were arrested in November last year when Indiana state troopers discovered five of their children inside an unheated box truck. The couple had been heading to California after Mr Detjen lost his job in Pennsylvania. This isn't the first time the Detjens have been in trouble with the law. Both parents have criminal records, including a child molestation conviction for Mr Detjen. Given their history, it's shocking that they were entrusted with the care of their own children. A child's upbringing has a profound and long-lasting impact on their lives. Kids who grow up in abusive or neglectful households are at a higher risk of developing behavioral and mental health problems later in life. The Detjen children will likely need support and counseling to overcome the neglect they suffered. Child neglect is a serious crime, and it's important that society holds perpetrators accountable for their actions. In this case, the Detjens were fortunate to receive suspended sentences, but they must understand the severity of their actions and take steps to ensure their children's welfare in the future. As a society, we must do more to prevent child neglect and abuse. This can be done through education, early intervention, and increased support for at-risk families.

Make your liquids honeythick. Create a pudding consistency in you liquids.","completion":"Thick liquids are essential for people who have difficulty swallowing or have dysphagia. These conditions make it hard to swallow regular liquids. Fortunately, there are ways to make your liquids thicker, so they are easier to swallow. One way to thicken liquids is to make a nectar-thick liquid. This consistency is similar to that of a light syrup or a thin honey texture. To create a nectar-thick liquid, you can add a commercial thickening agent, such as xanthan gum or cornstarch, to your beverage. Simply mix the thickening agent with the liquid until you achieve the desired consistency. Another option is to make your liquids honey-thick. Honey-thick liquids have the consistency of honey, making them easy to swallow. To make honey-thick liquids, you can use the same commercial thickening agents mentioned above, but with a different concentration. Honey-thick liquids are typically made with a larger quantity of thickeners than nectar-thick liquids. Finally, if you need a really thick liquid, you can create a pudding consistency in your liquids. Pudding-thick liquids are very thick, almost like soft pudding. This thicker consistency may be helpful if you have severe dysphagia or if you require a very slow flow of liquids. You can achieve a pudding consistency in your liquids by using a higher concentration of thickening agents than for nectar or honey-thick liquids. In conclusion, making your liquids thicker can greatly improve the quality of life for those with dysphagia or difficulty swallowing. By creating nectar-thick, honey-thick, or pudding-thick liquids, you can make swallowing easier and safer. These thickening techniques are simple to implement and can make a big difference in your daily life."},{"prompt":"Dialogue: Fanny: Did u signed the pettition? Felix: which one?

The race is part of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, along with the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. The value of the Preakness Stakes has fluctuated over the years, with some years being more valuable than others. In answering the question of which year had a higher value, 1919 or 1946, the answer is 1946. In 1919, the Preakness Stakes had a total purse of 25,000, which was a significant amount of money at the time. However, in 1946, the total purse was increased to 50,000, making it the more valuable year. This increase in value was due in part to the end of World War II, which led to an increase in attendance and interest in the race. The winner of the 1919 Preakness Stakes was Sir Barton, who went on to win the Triple Crown that year. The winner of the 1946 Preakness Stakes was Assault, who also won the Triple Crown that year.

By 1810, the population had grown to 80,000 before declining dramatically between 1829 and 1842 during the reigns of Radama I and especially Ranavalona I. Because of a combination of war, forced labor, disease and harsh measures of justice, the population of Imerina fell from 750,000 to 130,000 during this period. In the final years of the Kingdom of Imerina, the population had recovered to between 50,000 and 75,000; most of the population were slaves who were largely captured in provincial military campaigns. In 1950, Antananarivos population was around 175,000. By the late 1990s the population of the metropolitan area had reached 1.4 million, and – while the city itself now has a population (2013) of about 1,300,000 – with suburbs lying outside the city limits it had grown to almost 2.1 million in 2013.

Oftentimes, our inner critic can overpower any positive self-talk we attempt to give ourselves. However, by practicing positive self-talk, we can gradually quiet our inner critic and improve our mental health. One way to start using positive self-talk is to list alternative positive thoughts. For example, instead of thinking, “I can’t do this,” we can reframe our thoughts to, “This may be challenging, but I am capable of overcoming it.” By swapping out negative thoughts for positive ones, we can shift our mindset and start believing in ourselves. Another effective technique to quiet our inner critic is to practice deep-breathing exercises. When we feel anxious or overwhelmed, our breathing can change, and we may start taking shallow breaths. By focusing on our breath and taking slow, deep breaths, we can signal to our body that we are safe and calm down our nervous system. It’s important to acknowledge that worrying about what others think is a common trap we can fall into. However, by reminding ourselves that our worth and value do not rely on other people’s opinions, we can release ourselves from the pressure of external validation. In conclusion, practicing positive self-talk, deep-breathing exercises, and worrying less about what others think are all effective strategies to quiet our inner critic and improve our mental health.

However, a defense official has confirmed that this statement is far from the truth. While there has been a decrease in air travel due to travel restrictions and fear of contracting the virus, flights are still operating across the globe. This misinformation about flight disruptions was first reported by Wired.com. Such false reports can lead to panic and anxiety, causing individuals to cancel travel plans or unnecessarily stock up on supplies. It's important to verify information before spreading it. Meanwhile, drones continue to be used in targeted attacks against suspected militants in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen.

The use of drones in warfare raises ethical concerns, but for the military, they provide a strategic advantage in detecting and eliminating threats. In conclusion, while the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly disrupted many aspects of daily life, it's crucial to avoid spreading false information, especially when it concerns public safety.

It can help to mitigate the pain and even prevent some of the resulting scarring. When a burn occurs, it's essential to act fast. The first step should always be to run cool water over the affected area. This will help to soothe the discomfort and prevent the burn from spreading further. Once the area has been cooled, applying baking soda can provide further relief. The alkaline properties of baking soda can help to neutralize the acidic burn, easing the pain and reducing inflammation.

By doing so, you can stay up-to-date with your favorite celebrity's life, career, and opinions. However, it's not just about following them - it's important to pay attention to how they use their Twitter account. First and foremost, take note of the frequency of their tweets. Do they tweet often or seldom? This can give you an idea of how involved they are in their social media presence. Some celebrities post several times a day, while others may only post a few times a week. Additionally, note the times at which they post - is it during typical working hours, or later in the day or night? Another important aspect to consider is the content of their tweets. Do they mainly post about their personal life, or do they use their account mainly for promoting their work? Some celebrities may use Twitter to share news, upcoming projects, or behind-the-scenes glimpses of their lives. On the other hand, others may use their account to share personal musings or to engage with their followers. It's also worth observing how the celebrity interacts with their followers on Twitter. Do they often respond to tweets or retweet posts from fans? This level of engagement can give you insight into their personality and how they view their relationship with their fanbase. Finally, keep an eye out for any controversies or Twitter feuds that the celebrity may be involved in. While it's not always possible to avoid drama completely, you might want to think twice about following someone who repeatedly gets into online spats or is known for making controversial comments. In conclusion, following a celebrity on Twitter can be a fun way to stay informed about their life and work. However, it's important to pay attention to how they use their account - frequency of tweets, content, engagement with followers, and any controversies - so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not to follow them."},{"prompt":"Write a sentence about the following things: appreciate, darkness, miracle, sunrise, w","completion":"I appreciate the darkness before the sunrise, for it makes the miracle of a new day all the more beautiful, even though I must wait patiently for its arrival."},{"prompt":"What great pizza!

These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution.
