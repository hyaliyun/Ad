Orioles centerfield Adam Jones claimed that a fan threw a banana at him, which angered the player who took to Twitter to voice his displeasure.

Racism has no place in sports, and such incidents undermine the integrity of the game and diminish the joy that fans derive from it. The Giants organization has apologized for the incident and has assured fans that such behavior will not be tolerated. It is commendable that the team took swift action and publicly denounced the fan's actions. This sends a message to fans that such behavior will have serious consequences and will not be tolerated.

This means that a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current.

The typical solution is to use constantcurrent power supplies to keep the current below the LED's maximum current rating. Since most common power sources (batteries, mains) are constantvoltage sources, most LED fixtures must include a power converter, at least a currentlimiting resistor.

This is because the chemically differentiated oceanic crust is lighter than asthenosphere, but thermal contraction of the mantle lithosphere makes it more dense than the asthenosphere. The gravitational instability of mature oceanic lithosphere has the effect that at subduction zones, oceanic lithosphere invariably sinks underneath the overriding lithosphere, which can be oceanic or continental. New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at midocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 170 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. The oldest parts of continental lithosphere underlie cratons, and the mantle lithosphere there is thicker and less dense than typical; the relatively low density of such mantle \`\`roots of cratons'' helps to stabilize these regions.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Phage therapy is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria. The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell's death. Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect good bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings. However, studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria.

Place the ham in a large baking dish. Score the ham if you plan to glaze it. Cook for the right number of minutes per pound. Make the glaze. Glaze the ham when the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees.","completion":"The key to a perfectly cooked ham is all in the preparation. Before you start, preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Then, select a large baking dish that is appropriate for the size of your ham. If you plan to glaze your ham, score the outside first by making shallow cuts in a diamond pattern. This will allow the glaze to seep into the ham and create a deliciously sweet and savory crust. Next, it's important to cook the ham for the right amount of time. The general rule of thumb is to cook the ham for approximately 15 to 20 minutes per pound. This will ensure that your ham is fully cooked while retaining its moisture and flavor. While the ham is cooking, prepare the glaze. Choose your favorite recipe and combine the ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the mixture is smooth and heated through. Once the internal temperature of the ham reaches 135 degrees, it's time to apply the glaze. Brush a generous amount of glaze onto the ham, making sure to coat all sides evenly. Return the ham to the oven and continue to cook it for an additional 15 minutes to set the glaze. Once finished, let the ham rest for about 15 minutes before slicing and serving. By following these simple steps, you can guarantee a ham that is not only visually appealing, but also tender and delicious. So, the next time you plan to cook a ham, remember to preheat the oven, score the ham if glazing, and cook for the correct amount of time, all while making a tasty glaze to elevate your dish."},{"prompt":"f A single person riding a bike., can we conclude Two people ride on a bike.?

Dentists in the U.S. are known for providing high-quality care to their patients. They have an admirable record of ensuring patients' safety and taking measures to prevent the spread of infections. In fact, dental care in the U.S. is considered among the best in the world. Hanley asserts that the dental community has always made infection control and safety a top priority. Dental schools across the nation have stringent guidelines for infection control and safety. Dentists are required to undergo training on proper sterilization techniques, and they must follow strict protocols before, during, and after each patient visit.

In summary, the case of the dentist in Oklahoma who put thousands of patients at risk for serious infections is unfortunate.

One of the most prominent pieces of information that many viewers seek to find out is how many touchdowns were scored in a particular half. In this case, we will focus on the second half of the game. The number of touchdowns scored in the second half can vary widely, depending on the teams playing and their individual strategies. However, we can make an educated prediction based on historical data and recent performances. Firstly, it's important to note that the number of touchdowns scored in the second half is usually fewer than in the first half. This trend can be attributed to the endurance factor - as both teams may begin to tire as the game progresses, leading to less aggressive plays and less energy overall. However, it's also crucial to consider the teams playing and their unique strengths and weaknesses. If there are two teams with strong offenses, they may continue to score touchdowns well into the second half. On the other hand, if one team has a weak offense or defense, they may struggle to keep up with their opponents and score fewer touchdowns overall. In conclusion, without knowing which teams are playing or what their respective strengths and weaknesses may be, it's difficult to provide an exact number of touchdowns scored during the second half. However, based on the trends we've observed, it's safe to assume that there will likely be fewer touchdowns scored than in the first half."},{"prompt":"Q: French historians generally use the beginning of which King's reign to date the start of the Enlightenment?

Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the ProtoIndoEuropean pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.

There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth, generally through revelation or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is religious pluralism. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is syncretism, mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the New Age movement.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

During his career, Brees has thrown for countless touchdowns, setting numerous records and leading his teams to multiple playoff appearances. To answer the question of how many total yards Brees has thrown for touchdowns, we must first look at his career statistics. As of the end of the 2020 NFL season, Brees has thrown for a total of 571 touchdowns, which ranks him second all-time behind only Tom Brady. When it comes to the total number of yards Brees has thrown for touchdowns, the answer is an impressive 67,574 yards. This means that on average, Brees has thrown for just over 118 yards per touchdown pass. It's worth noting, however, that not all of Brees' touchdown passes have come from long bombs down the field. In fact, many of his touchdowns have come from short passes that his receivers have taken for big gains. This is in part due to Brees' accuracy and ability to hit his receivers in stride, allowing them to pick up yards after the catch. In conclusion, Drew Brees has thrown for an incredible 67,574 yards during his career, with each of his 571 touchdown passes contributing to that total.

They typically don't attack players unless provoked, but once they are, they become quite dangerous. In this article, we will look at some tips for dealing with these mobs. The first step in dealing with Pigmen is to be aware of your surroundings. Look out for any Pigmen nearby before making any sudden movements. Once you have taken note of their position, try to get onto one side of the Pigmen. This will help you to avoid engaging multiple Pigmen at once. The next step is to run and hit any Pigmen who are too close. Use your weapon to attack them and keep them at bay while you move around. Be sure to keep moving while you engage them, as standing still can leave you vulnerable to attacks. It's important to remember that Pigmen are not very strong individually, but they can quickly become overwhelming in numbers. To avoid this scenario, it's best to take them on one by one. Once you have separated a Pigman from the others, use your weapon to take it down. If you find yourself outnumbered, the best course of action is to retreat. Running backwards while continuing to hit your attackers can help you create some distance between you and the Pigmen. This can also give you the opportunity to heal up before launching another attack. In conclusion, dealing with Pigmen in Minecraft requires a bit of caution and planning. Be aware of your surroundings, get to one side of the Pigmen, attack them one by one, and be ready to retreat if necessary. By following these tips, you can increase your chances of surviving encounters with these hostile mobs."},{"prompt":"pain has recorded its first ever case of murder involving a married gay couple since the government allowed samesex unions five years ago , local authorities said wednesday .

When Lee was 10 years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father's newspaper which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of tuberculosis in 1937. Scholars believe that Robinson's difficulties reflect the notorious case of the Scottsboro Boys, in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. However, in 2005, Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served the same purpose to display Southern prejudices. Emmett Till, a black teenager who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in Mississippi in 1955, and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement, is also considered a model for Tom Robinson.

This rebirth can be traced to the movement of New Urbanism and postmodern architecture's embrace of classical elements as ironic, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith, began to consider classicism seriously. While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the University of Virginia, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully. Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence. Today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style, since a generation of architects trained in this discipline shapes urban planning.

Simon Reynolds described the period as a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created, the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it, and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era. Nicholas Lezard wrote that the music of the period was avantgarde, open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves, united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral, concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience, or making them think, as in making a pop song.

Beeswax is an excellent choice for those looking for a soft, natural finish. It is a natural product that is gentle on furniture and can bring out the natural beauty of the wood. It is ideal for those who prefer a simple, natural look in their furniture. On the other hand, carnauba wax is a great option for those looking for a long-lasting finish. This wax is made from the leaves of the carnauba palm tree and is highly durable. It can provide a shiny, glossy finish that is perfect for modern and contemporary furniture. If you have heavily carved or ornate furniture, liquid wax is your best bet. This type of wax can easily get into all the small nooks and crannies of intricate furniture pieces. It also enables you to achieve a smooth and even finish that would be difficult to achieve with other types of wax. However, it is essential to note that not all wax is suitable for all furniture types. For instance, you should avoid using floor wax on furniture. This is because floor wax is designed to withstand high traffic, which makes it a more durable option that is not suitable for furniture. It will create a finish that is too hard, and you may have to strip it later on. In conclusion, choosing the right wax for your furniture is crucial in achieving the look and durability you desire. Beeswax and carnauba wax are two popular options that can provide a soft natural finish and long-lasting finish, respectively. Liquid wax is suitable for heavily carved or ornate furniture, while floor wax should be avoided on furniture.

The overall commander of the Allied forces during the Crimean campaigns was Lord Raglan, a British Army officer. He was appointed by Queen Victoria to lead the British contingent and was given the title of Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Crimea. Raglan had a long and distinguished military career, having fought in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo. However, he was not always the right man for the job. He lacked experience in commanding large-scale operations and was sometimes slow to react to the changing circumstances on the battlefield. The French forces were commanded by Marshal Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud, a highly regarded military leader who had served in Algeria and the Crimean War. However, he fell ill during the campaign and was replaced by General François Certain Canrobert. The Ottoman forces were led by Omar Pasha, a highly skilled commander who had fought in several wars before the Crimean campaigns.

The Sardinian army was commanded by General Alfonso La Marmora, who had also fought in several wars before the Crimean campaigns.

His son Jonathan is already serving a yearlong sentence for helping his dad in the scheme which led to a multistate search.","completion":"Raymond Roth Admits to Faking Drowning in Elaborate Insurance Scam In 2012, Raymond Roth perpetrated an elaborate scheme that involved faking his own drowning in an attempt to collect on his life insurance policy. He had enlisted the help of his son, Jonathan, who is currently serving a year-long prison sentence for his involvement in the scam. Recently, Raymond Roth also pleaded guilty to charges of impersonating a police officer. The incident had led to a multi-state search as officials believed that Roth had drowned in the waters off Jones Beach, New York. Upon closer investigation, the authorities discovered that Roth had actually been staying in a hotel in Florida and had been using his son's identification to check in. He had even gone so far as to contact the police and report that he had seen his own son walking along the same beach where he had allegedly drowned. Roth's elaborate plan fell apart when he was pulled over by police in South Carolina for speeding. The officer became suspicious of his story and contacted the authorities in New York who discovered the hoax. Although it is not clear how much money Roth was attempting to collect from the scam, it is certain that his actions have ruined his reputation and landed him in legal trouble. His admission to the charges of faking his own drowning and impersonating a police officer have exposed the extent of his deceptions and could result in further consequences. The case serves as a reminder of the serious consequences of illegal acts such as insurance fraud and impersonating a police officer. It is important for the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities to the authorities."},{"prompt":"Write a question about the article They put me through to another section ' Customer Service ' , who said they would try to contact baggage services on my behalf ( I ' m presuming that I got ' special ' service here , as I am a Platinum Frequent Flyer with Qantas which is the highest level one can achieve , other than a special invitation to the Chairman 's Club .

Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her greatgrandsons, Tsarevich Alexei of Russia, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers.

In fact, in some metropolitan areas, such as Washington D.C. and San Francisco, unmarried couples living together now make up over 15% of all households.

On the other hand, only 21% said the same of Labour, indicating a wider gap among working-class voters. This news comes during a time when Ed Miliband and his party have been hit with controversy, following a tweet made by MP Emily Thornberry. The tweet, which showed a picture of a house draped in England flags with a parked white van in the driveway, was seen as mocking the working-class residents of Rochester, where she was campaigning. Many saw this as a reflection of Labour's inability to understand and connect with working-class voters. Miliband has been damaged by the row over the tweet, with some critics labeling it a \\"disaster\\" for the Labour Party. This survey adds fuel to the fire, highlighting the growing divide between working-class voters and the Labour Party. With UKIP's more populist and anti-establishment stance, they have been able to appeal to disenchanted voters who feel left behind by mainstream parties like Labour. This is a trend seen across Europe, with similar right-wing populist movements gaining traction in countries such as France and Germany. The controversy over the Thornberry tweet serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding and respecting the values and lifestyles of all voters. With the 2015 UK general election looming, it will be crucial for parties to connect with the working class, who make up a significant portion of the electorate.

This manifested early in 1519–1523 when the artisan guilds known as the Germanies revolted against the government of the Habsburg king Charles I in Valencia, now part of the Crown of Aragon, with most of the fighting done in 1521. The revolt was an antimonarchist, antifeudal autonomist movement inspired by the Italian republics, and a social revolt against the nobility who had fled the city before an epidemic of plague in 1519. It also bore a strong antiIslamic aspect, as rebels rioted against Aragon's population of mudéjars and imposed forced conversions to Christianity.

It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes. These structures let them see Earths magnetic field as a visual pattern. Question: What works to detect Earth's magnetic north pole, telling direction besides people's compasses?

In the modern era, Russia has been one of the most significant actors in the region, and the history of its military interventions in Crimea is worth examining. The first Crimean campaign by Russian forces took place in 1853-56, in the context of the wider conflicts among European powers known as the Crimean War. Russia, seeking to expand its influence in the Black Sea region, clashed with a coalition comprising the Ottoman Empire, France, the United Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Sardinia. After a long and costly war, Russia was forced to cede some territories and limit its military presence in the Black Sea. The second Crimean campaign by Russian forces occurred more recently, in 2014. This time, the context was the political turmoil and protests that erupted in Ukraine, leading to the downfall of the Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Russia, fearing the loss of its strategic interests in Ukraine, especially in Crimea, intervened militarily by annexing the peninsula and supporting separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. The international community condemned Russia's actions and imposed economic sanctions, but Moscow maintained its military and political presence in Crimea. Therefore, the answer to the question of how many years difference is there between the first year of the two Crimean campaigns and the last time Crimea was approached by Russian forces is 158 years. This long period highlights the enduring importance of Crimea to Russian interests and the persistence of geopolitical conflicts in the region."},{"prompt":"John Chase is by far the most knowledgeable and sincere insurance agent I have ever used or recommended.

The plan reflects a growing concern among Russia's policymakers that other leading space powers, including the United States and China, are making progress too quickly in the race for dominance in space exploration. The proposed Earth-monitoring observatory on the Moon would provide crucial data and insights into our planet's climate and environmental changes.

Generally the camera is triggered when a vehicle enters the intersection (passes the stopbar) after the traffic signal has turned red. Typically, a law enforcement official will review the photographic evidence and determine whether a violation occurred. A citation is then usually mailed to the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of the law. These cameras are used worldwide, in countries including: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United States.

Familiarize yourself with relaxation techniques.","completion":"Exposure therapy is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy that can be very effective in treating anxiety disorders. If you have a fear of birds, exposure therapy may be a good option for you. Before you begin exposure therapy, it is essential to think about why you are afraid of birds. Understanding the root cause of your fear can help you overcome it. Once you understand why you are afraid of birds, you can begin to detail your triggers. Maybe you are afraid of birds because you had a negative encounter with one as a child, or perhaps you simply find them intimidating. Whatever your trigger may be, you can work through it with exposure therapy. Next, you will need to create a hierarchy of your phobia. This involves identifying different situations related to birds that trigger your fear and ranking them from least to most anxiety-provoking. In the early stages of exposure therapy, you will start with the least anxiety-provoking situations and work your way up to the most anxiety-provoking. As you begin exposure therapy, it is essential to familiarize yourself with a discomfort scale. This allows you to rate your level of anxiety during different exposure exercises. By tracking your level of discomfort, you can monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed. When deciding the pace at which to move through your hierarchy, it is important to take baby steps. Start with exposure exercises that produce only a mild level of discomfort, and gradually work up to more anxiety-provoking situations. Remember, the goal is to desensitize yourself to birds, not to overwhelm yourself. Finally, familiarize yourself with relaxation techniques. These can help you manage anxiety during exposure exercises. Breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery are all effective ways to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. In conclusion, exposure therapy can be an effective treatment option for those who have a fear of birds. By understanding the root cause of your fear, creating a hierarchy of your phobia, and utilizing relaxation techniques, you can work towards overcoming your fear and living a more fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"What is the answer: Which military leader had a spaniel called Rommel?","completion":"The military leader with a spaniel called Rommel is Erwin Rommel."},{"prompt":"Premise: well in in division one and i got uh went right to you know they have the job centers for us and everything and i just Hypothesis: The job centers perform background checks on their applications.

It is important to make requests, not demands, as demands can come across as aggressive and off-putting. By making requests, you show respect for the other person's time and personal boundaries. Negotiation is often necessary when making requests, as the other person may not immediately agree to what you are asking for. Be prepared to compromise and find a solution that works for both parties. This way, you are more likely to receive what you want, and maintain a positive relationship with the other person. Politeness and good manners are always important, regardless of the situation. When making requests, be sure to use phrases such as \\"please\\" and \\"thank you.\\" These small gestures can go a long way in building rapport and showing appreciation for the other person's willingness to help you. Finally, it is important to make realistic requests. Be aware of your own limitations and those of the other person. Only request what is reasonable and achievable, taking into account any prior commitments or potential obstacles. By doing so, you increase the chances of your request being granted, and avoid setting unrealistic expectations for yourself and others. In conclusion, making requests can be a delicate process, but by following these tips, you can improve your chances of success.

Look for other ingredients that replace silicones. Opt for hydrating alcohols over drying ones.","completion":"When it comes to choosing personal care products, many people pay attention to the brand, scent, and packaging but forget to focus on the ingredients they contain. Sulfates are a common ingredient in cleansing and foaming products that can be harsh and damaging to sensitive or dry skin. Instead, consumers should opt for surfactants that are better for their skin and the environment. Water-soluble silicones are another ingredient to look out for when choosing personal care products. Silicones are commonly used to create a silky and smooth texture in creams and lotions, but they can also clog pores and cause breakouts. Choosing products with water-soluble silicones eliminates this issue and allows for easy removal of the product. Moreover, many people may not know that there are alternatives to silicones. Plant-based ingredients such as squalane, jojoba oil, and shea butter can provide the same benefits as silicones, while also being more sustainable and gentle on the skin. Alcohols are another ingredient that deserves attention. While some alcohols are known to dry out the skin, others such as glycerin and panthenol are hydrating and can help soothe and protect the skin. In summary, when selecting personal care products, it is essential to read the ingredient list carefully, understand the benefits and drawbacks of each ingredient, and opt for those that will benefit your skin and the environment.
