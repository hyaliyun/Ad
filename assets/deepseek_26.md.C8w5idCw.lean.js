Early 20th century critics such as Ezra Pound, T. E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental slop (Hulme)[citation needed] or an old bitch gone in the teeth (Pound) and wanted to go back to a more manly, authoritarian society such as (they believed) existed in the Middle Ages. Postmodern critics who are selfdescribed antihumanists, such as JeanFrançois Lyotard and Michel Foucault, have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature, which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal, suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger). Nevertheless, philosopher Kate Soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, antihumanism thus frequently secretes a humanist rhetoric.

Drone strikes have weakened al Qaeda in Yemen.","completion":"Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al Qaeda, made new threats to commemorate the tragic events of 9/11. In a video message released last week, he called on his followers to \\"land a large strike\\" against the United States, naming the Boston Marathon bombings as an example. The message is a reminder of the continuing threat posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates around the world. Despite the group's weakened state in recent years, Zawahiri's call to action shows that they are still capable of carrying out deadly attacks on innocent civilians. One of the factors that has contributed to al Qaeda's decline has been the increased use of drone strikes by the United States. These strikes have targeted key leaders and operatives of the group in Yemen, where al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has established a foothold. The drone strikes have been controversial, with critics arguing that they are a violation of international law and have resulted in civilian casualties. However, supporters of the program point to the success in disrupting al Qaeda's ability to plan and carry out attacks. Despite the success of the drone strikes, al Qaeda and its affiliates continue to pose a threat to the United States and its allies. Zawahiri's call to action should serve as a reminder that the fight against terrorism is far from over, and that vigilance and determination are still needed to protect innocent lives. In conclusion, as we remember and honor the victims of 9/11, we must also remain vigilant against the ongoing threat of terrorism posed by al Qaeda and other extremist groups.

The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin.

PM signals he is prepared to deploy special forces to get them dead or alive. Accusations were also echoed by a friend who was on also on aid convoy. Majid Freeman says the government 'abandoned' Mr Henning.","completion":"The brother-in-law of Alan Henning, a British aid worker who was beheaded by ISIS in 2014, has criticized government ministers for their failure to take action to secure his release. Colin Livesey accused them of knowing about Henning's capture \\"months and months ago\\" but failing to act. These accusations were echoed by Majid Freeman, a friend who was also on the aid convoy with Henning, who accused the government of abandoning him. David Cameron, the then-Prime Minister of the UK, responded to these criticisms by ordering spy chiefs to track down the killers and signaling his willingness to deploy special forces to capture them, dead or alive. The anger and frustration expressed by Livesey and Freeman are understandable. Henning was a well-loved and respected aid worker who had traveled to Syria with a group of volunteers to deliver aid to those affected by the conflict. He was kidnapped by ISIS in December 2013 and his captors released a video showing his beheading in October 2014. The UK government had been working through diplomatic channels to secure Henning's release, but it is clear that these efforts were not successful. In hindsight, it is easy to criticize the government's actions or lack thereof, but it is important to remember that they were operating in a very difficult and complex environment. The tragedy of Alan Henning's death should serve as a reminder of the need for continued international cooperation to defeat the threat of ISIS and other extremist groups. It is also a reminder that aid workers who choose to work in dangerous and conflict-affected regions need the support and protection of governments, NGOs, and the wider international community."},{"prompt":"Equipped with bells and the familiar red kettles, local Salvation Army volunteers and clients will hit the streets this weekend for the agency #39;s annual kettle campaign.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Around 66 BC, a movement to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began. After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named Lucius Sergius Catilina. The movement was based in the town of Faesulae, which was a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation. The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome, and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63 BC.

If both teams score an equal number of field goals in one quarter, it can create a sense of balance that can reflect positively on both the strategic skills of both teams. To determine the quarter where both teams scored the same number of field goals, careful analysis of game statistics is necessary. The box scores will provide valuable insight into the game performance of each team during each quarter, specifically in terms of the number of field goals made. One approach is to start by reviewing the game reports and tracking the number of field goals scored by each team in each quarter. It is important to note that the calculations should focus only on field goals, as opposed to free throws or three-pointers. For example, if Team A and Team B had four quarters in their game, and the score of each quarter was as follows: - Quarter One: Team A 5, Team B 7 - Quarter Two: Team A 2, Team B 9 - Quarter Three: Team A 6, Team B 4 - Quarter Four: Team A 3, Team B 3 The fourth quarter is the quarter where both teams scored the same number of field goals. In conclusion, finding the quarter where both teams scored an equal number of field goals enhances understanding of the overall game performance of each team. The box score helps to identify the quarter where both teams scored the same number of field goals, allowing basketball enthusiasts to better appreciate the skills of the competitors in the game."},{"prompt":"Read this article and answer this question As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 18,728 people, 5,720 households, and 4,410 families residing in the county.

Many have accused him of making an inverted Nazi salute during the celebration, but Anelka insists that it was a gesture dedicated to a friend. The gesture, which involves an outstretched arm with the hand pointing downwards, is associated with far-right movements and has been used as a symbol of hate and intolerance. Anelka's celebration has drawn widespread criticism and condemnation, with many calling for him to be punished for his actions. The Football Association (FA) has launched an investigation into the incident and Anelka could potentially face a minimum five-game ban if found guilty. The FA has a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination, including gestures or language that is deemed to be racist or anti-Semitic. Anelka has defended his actions, stating that the gesture was a dedication to a friend who is a comedian known for using the gesture in his performances. However, many find this explanation to be inadequate and inappropriate, especially given the historical connotations of the gesture. The incident has ignited a debate about the role of footballers as role models and the responsibility they have to promote tolerance, diversity, and respect. Many argue that footballers, as high-profile public figures, have a duty to lead by example and set a positive example for younger generations. Regardless of Anelka's intentions, the fact remains that the gesture he made is highly offensive and has no place in modern society. It is up to the FA to determine whether Anelka's actions constitute a breach of its rules and whether he should be punished accordingly. As the investigation continues, it is important for everyone involved to remember the importance of tolerance and respect, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society."},{"prompt":"Based on the sentence A group of 14 men are standing up stairs with a pair of men on each stair with identical shirts on except for one., is the sentence A groom and his friends pose for a wedding picture on some stairs. a true sentence?

When cleaning up water-based inks, it's important to act quickly. The longer the ink sits, the harder it will be to remove. To clean up water-based inks using disposable baby wipes, start by wiping away as much of the ink as possible using a dry cloth or paper towel. Then, take a disposable baby wipe and gently scrub the affected area. Be sure to use a light touch, as you don't want to damage the surface you're cleaning. If the ink is particularly stubborn, you may need to repeat the process a few times to completely remove it. Once the ink is gone, use a clean cloth or paper towel to dry the area thoroughly. While disposable baby wipes are an excellent choice for cleaning up water-based inks, it's important to dispose of them properly. Never flush them down the toilet, as they can cause clogs in your plumbing. Instead, toss them in the trash. In conclusion, choosing disposable baby wipes to clean off water-based inks is a smart move. Not only are they effective, but they are also gentle on surfaces and easy to use.

The pass was thrown by Jeff George, who was playing for the Indianapolis Colts at that time. The game was against the Seattle Seahawks, and the touchdown pass covered a distance of 87 yards. George's pass was caught by receiver Bill Brooks, who ran the remaining yards to score the touchdown. Jeff George was a quarterback who played in the NFL from 1990 to 2006. He was the first overall pick in the 1990 NFL draft and played for several teams during his career, including the Colts, Atlanta Falcons, Oakland Raiders, Minnesota Vikings, Washington Redskins, and Seattle Seahawks.

A shift away from books as physical books fade away, to CD's and DVD's only to see them fade, to video games, to musical instruments, to electronics and to even more random trade items to survive.

Wear clothes that blend into your surroundings.","completion":"When it comes to venturing out into the wilderness, there are a few key rules to follow in order to stay safe. One of the most important rules is to cover as much skin as possible and wear clothes that blend into your surroundings. The reason for this is simple: by covering up, you minimize your risk of getting bitten by insects, encountering harmful plants, or getting sunburnt. Additionally, by wearing clothes that blend into your surroundings, you make yourself less visible to both wildlife and other humans. When choosing clothing for outdoor excursions, it's wise to opt for long-sleeved shirts, pants, and footwear that covers the majority of your feet. These items not only keep you protected from the elements and pests, but also act as a barrier against any thorny or prickly plants that might be in your path. Color choice is also important. Neutral colors like tan, gray, and green are preferable because they blend in with natural surroundings. Bright colors or patterns can make you stand out, and may attract unwanted attention from animals or other people. Finally, it's important to consider the material of your clothing. Lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton or nylon are ideal for outdoor activities, as they allow sweat to evaporate and keep you cool. Synthetic materials like polyester are also a good choice, as they wick moisture away from the skin and dry quickly. By following these guidelines and covering up as much as possible with practical, earth-toned clothes, you can help protect yourself during outdoor adventures.

The search for MH370 has been fraught with setbacks, with officials predicting that it could take a very long time, if at all, to locate the missing plane. The weather is just one of the many challenges that search parties are facing, and it is likely to be a significant factor in any further attempts to locate the wreckage. As the world watches and waits for news on the missing aircraft, it is clear that the search for MH370 will continue to be a complex and difficult task for all involved. We can only hope that new technologies and advances in our understanding of the ocean's depths will make it possible to finally locate the lost plane and bring closure to the families of those who were onboard."},{"prompt":"What is an example of a tweet?","completion":"\\"I just finished reading \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and it was amazing! #greatbook #mustread\\""},{"prompt":"Question: Frdric Chopin is best known for his compositions for which instrument?

David Miranda, a Brazilian national, had possessions including his laptop seized and was questioned extensively about the Guardian's reporting of Edward Snowden's NSA leaks, says Greenwald. They never asked him about a single question at all about terrorism or anything relating to a terrorist organization, Greenwald tells the BBC. “This is obviously a serious, radical escalation of what they are doing. He is my partner. He is not even a journalist.” Miranda was in transit through Heathrow on his way back to Brazil from Berlin, where he had been visiting documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, who has been working with Snowden and Greenwald, the New York Times reports. Greenwald says the intimidation and bullying of his partner has only strengthened his resolve to report on the NSA leaks. If the UK and US governments believe that tactics like this are going to deter or intimidate us in any way from continuing to report aggressively on what these documents reveal, they are beyond deluded, he says. Expand this summary.","completion":"David Miranda, the partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, was detained for nine hours at London's Heathrow airport and had his laptop seized under a counterterrorism law.

The construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion.

Trim the stems back by no more than 10 to 20 percent in the shrub's first winter or early spring. Prune your plant more intensely as it ages. Always use sharp hand pruners to prune one branch at a time.","completion":"When it comes to taking care of your plants, pruning is an essential task that shouldn't be overlooked. Pruning is the act of removing unwanted parts of a plant, such as leaves, branches, or stems. It is essential for the plant's health, growth and appearance. If you have a shrub in your garden, it's best to prune it in the spring. This is because pruning in the spring will encourage new growth and help the shrub grow more vigorously throughout the growing season. When pruning, trim the stems back by no more than 10 to 20 percent in the shrub's first winter or early spring. This will prevent cutting too much and damaging the plant. As your plant ages, it will require more intense pruning to keep it healthy and in good shape. This is because older plants have thicker and more numerous branches, and pruning them will prevent the shrub from becoming too dense and inhibiting new growth. Pruning also helps maintain the shape and size of the plant, preventing it from becoming unmanageable. When pruning your plant, always use sharp hand pruners to prune one branch at a time. Dull pruners can cause damage to the plant, making it susceptible to diseases and pests. Using sharp pruners will ensure a clean cut, which will aid in the plant's healing process. In summary, pruning is an essential task that should be done in the spring to encourage new growth and maintain the plant's health. When pruning, trim the stems back by no more than 10 to 20 percent in the shrub's first winter or early spring. As your plant ages, it will require more intense pruning to keep it healthy and in good shape. Always use sharp hand pruners to prune one branch at a time to prevent damage to the plant.

Not known if Miss Harrison and Assange are still in a relationship.","completion":"Sarah Harrison: the woman behind Edward Snowden's escape to Moscow Sarah Harrison, a 31-year-old British journalist and activist, has played a crucial role in two of the biggest leaks in recent history. She was the one who accompanied former CIA technician Edward Snowden on his flight from Hong Kong to Moscow in 2013. And before that, she was known for helping WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange seek asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Harrison became an expert on extradition by working alongside Assange during his stay at the embassy. She helped him to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced allegations of sexual assault. Harrison was a key member of the legal team that argued that Assange would not get a fair trial and could face extradition to the US, where he could be charged with espionage. But her biggest challenge came in 2013, when she became Snowden's shepherd to Moscow. The former NSA contractor had leaked thousands of classified documents that exposed the US government's surveillance programs. Harrison had been working with WikiLeaks at the time and was asked to help Snowden, who was hiding out in Hong Kong. Harrison flew to Hong Kong and stayed with Snowden in a hotel room. She arranged for his flight to Moscow, where he was eventually granted asylum. Her efforts to assist Snowden have made her a hero to many in the world of whistleblowers and transparency activists. However, there has been some speculation about Harrison's personal life, specifically whether or not she is still in a relationship with Assange. The two were romantically linked during the time he was seeking asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy, but it is unclear if they are still together. Regardless of her personal life, there is no denying that Sarah Harrison has made a significant impact in the fight for government transparency and personal privacy. Her work with WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden has brought attention to important issues that affect us all, and her bravery and intellect have earned her a place in history as a protector of democracy and civil liberties."},{"prompt":"Premise: Adrin stepped forward, put the barrel of his pistol against the man's forehead, and fired.

Look for signs of megaesophagus. Go to the hospital if you see signs of megacolon.","completion":"Understanding and Monitoring Digestive and Heart Problems The human body is a complex organism that requires proper care and attention to function at its best. One of the crucial aspects of maintaining good health is by keeping an eye on our digestive system and cardiovascular functions. Here we will discuss some important considerations for both areas to ensure a healthy and long-lasting life. Indeterminate Phase Before discussing the specifics of heart and digestive problems, it is essential to understand what an indeterminate phase is. This is a period of time that a patient may be experiencing symptoms or illnesses, but a diagnosis has yet to be determined. In this phase, it is important to monitor any unusual symptoms and report them to a doctor promptly. Heart Problems According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Therefore, taking care of your heart is a critical concern for everyone. Common signs of heart disease include chest pain, shortness of breath, and irregular heartbeat. If you have a history of heart disease in your family, it's essential to monitor your heart health closely. Digestive Problems Digestive issues can cause discomfort, but they can also be a sign of more severe conditions. If you experience persistent abdominal pain or changes in bowel movements, it is vital to seek medical attention. Symptoms such as excessive bloating or irregular bowel movements may also be indications of underlying digestive conditions. Megaesophagus and Megacolon Megaesophagus and megacolon are rare conditions that affect the esophagus and colon, respectively. Megaesophagus is a condition that causes a widening of the esophagus, which can lead to difficulty swallowing and regurgitation of food. Megacolon occurs when the colon becomes dilated, leading to constipation and bowel obstruction. If you observe any signs of these conditions, such as food regurgitation or bowel obstruction, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention. In conclusion, taking care of your body and understanding the importance of monitoring specific symptoms is essential for maintaining good health. Be sure to monitor any digestive problems, watch out for heart problems and understand the significance of indeterminate phases.

People who drank two to three cups were 37% less likely to suffer a fracture. May be because the plant chemicals in tea boost building of new bone. Fluoride, calcium and other minerals also make bones denser and stronger. The effect was not the same with coffee which had no benefit, experts said. Around 1,150 Britons die each month after breaking a hip. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Drinking tea could help to reduce the risk of hip fractures according to new research. The study found that people who drank two to three cups of tea per day were 37% less likely to experience a fracture compared to those who didn't drink tea. This is because the plant chemicals found in tea help to build new bone, making it stronger and more resilient. One theory is that tea contains fluoride, calcium and other minerals that contribute to the development of strong bones. This is good news for the estimated 1,150 Britons who die each month after breaking a hip. It is hoped that by encouraging people to drink tea regularly, the number of these deaths could be significantly reduced. Interestingly, the same effect was not seen with coffee. Experts believe that there may be some other compounds in tea that are responsible for the bone-building benefits. However, this does not mean that coffee is bad for bones. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between coffee and bone health. Overall, this study provides yet another reason to enjoy a cup of tea in the morning.
