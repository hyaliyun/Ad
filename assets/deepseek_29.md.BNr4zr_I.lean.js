Illingworth has been released from jail immediately and will not have to pay back any of the taxpayers money. Paid an almost 300,000 salary until this year despite being sacked in 2011. Supporters have raised over 30,000 to defend her. Was named the Queensland Senior Australian of the Year in 2009.","completion":"Jean Illingworth, the former principal of Djarragun College near Cairns, has recently been released from jail after being convicted of fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars in funding from the Federal government. This news raises questions about the effectiveness of the justice system and the responsibility of government officials to hold wrongdoers accountable. Despite defrauding taxpayers of millions of dollars, Illingworth will not have to pay back any of the money she stole. This is a significant failure of justice, as Illingworth profited at the expense of hardworking taxpayers. Additionally, Illingworth's nearly 300,000 salary continued until this year, despite being fired in 2011. It is unclear why she continued to be paid such a high salary despite the allegations against her. Furthermore, it is concerning that Illingworth has a support network that has raised over 30,000 to defend her. While everyone deserves a fair trial and representation, it is disheartening to know that people are rallying behind someone who has been found guilty of fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars in funding. Before her conviction, Illingworth was named the Queensland Senior Australian of the Year in 2009. It is disappointing to see someone with such a positive public image commit such a serious crime. Overall, the case of Jean Illingworth is troubling and demonstrates the need for greater accountability for those in power. The justice system must ensure that those who defraud taxpayers are held accountable for their actions and made to pay restitution for the harm they have caused."},{"prompt":"Attributes: name = The Cricketers, eatType = coffee shop, food = Japanese, customer rating = 5 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Portland Arms.

As American poet Kenneth Rexroth explains, Cubism in poetry is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made selfsufficient by its rigorous architecture. This is quite different from the free association of the Surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of Dada. Nonetheless, the Cubist poets' influence on both Cubism and the later movements of Dada and Surrealism was profound; Louis Aragon, founding member of Surrealism, said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was our immediate elder, the exemplary poet. Though not as well remembered as the Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; American poets John Ashbery and Ron Padgett have recently produced new translations of Reverdy's work. Wallace Stevens' Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird is also said to demonstrate how cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry. Please answer a question about this article.

Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496).

It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters.

The single goal of the game came courtesy of a strike from Callum McManaman, who has impressed for Wigan since returning from his loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday. This crucial victory should give the Latics a much-needed boost, as they have struggled for form in recent weeks and fallen dangerously close to the relegation zone. Looking ahead, Uwe Rosler will hope that this win marks the turning point in Wigan's season, and that his team can build on this momentum to climb up the table.

One of the most common strategies is to move to strike any statements made during settlement negotiations. This is because settlement negotiations are meant to be confidential and using them as evidence may violate attorney-client privilege. Another important strategy is to claim both attorney-client privilege and spousal privilege. Attorney-client privilege refers to the confidentiality between an attorney and their client, while spousal privilege protects certain information between spouses from being used in court. Both of these privileges can help prevent potentially harmful information from being used against you or your client. It is also important to argue that evidence was seized without a warrant. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures, and if evidence was obtained without a warrant, it may be inadmissible in court. Finally, it is important to argue that you or your client were not given Miranda warnings. Miranda warnings inform individuals of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney, and if these warnings were not given, any statements made may not be admissible in court. Overall, there are several strategies that can be employed to protect yourself or your client when facing legal proceedings. By moving to strike certain statements, claiming privileges, and arguing against the admissibility of evidence, you may be able to improve your chances of a favorable outcome."},{"prompt":"ght foot hurts since tuesday morning How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?

Shortly thereafter, a Taiping expeditionary force penetrated as far north as the suburbs of Tianjin, the imperial heartlands. In desperation the Qing court ordered a Chinese official, Zeng Guofan, to organize regional and village militias into an emergency army called tuanlian. Zeng Guofan's strategy was to rely on local gentry to raise a new type of military organization from those provinces that the Taiping rebels directly threatened. This new force became known as the Xiang Army, named after the Hunan region where it was raised. The Xiang Army was a hybrid of local militia and a standing army. It was given professional training, but was paid for out of regional coffers and funds its commanders — mostly members of the Chinese gentry — could muster.

However, in some situations it is desirable to move, migrate a database from one DBMS to another.

The migration involves the database's transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database's conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (onetime) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate.

According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2019, the white population accounted for 76.3% of the total population, while African Americans accounted for 13.4%. This trend can be traced back to the country's history of colonization, slavery, and immigration. The white population has been the dominant racial group since the early days of European colonization, while African Americans were brought to the country as slaves from Africa. Even after the abolition of slavery and the Civil Rights Movement, systemic racism and discrimination have continued to affect African Americans, leading to disparities in education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. Meanwhile, white immigrants continued to arrive in the United States in large numbers throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, contributing to the growth of the white population. However, in recent years, the overall percentage of white Americans has been gradually declining due to the increased diversity of the population.

Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royals commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17thcentury France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital.

Cosby, who was once the sitcom king on NBC with his popular show \\"The Cosby Show,\\" has faced a lot of career fallout following allegations of sexual assault that have surfaced in the past several years. Last year, NBC said it was dropping plans to develop a \\"classic\\" family sitcom with Cosby, and now they have officially announced that they are completely done with him. This decision comes as no surprise given the severity of the allegations against Cosby and the negative attention they have generated for the network. In addition to NBC's decision, other networks and venues have also distanced themselves from Cosby. Netflix has indefinitely postponed a comedy special that he was scheduled to film, and several venues have canceled his concerts in his ongoing tour.

However, all good story endings share one element: they leave the reader with something to think about. Your reader should come away from the story thinking about the important themes of your story and it's significance. For a personal or academic essay, your conclusion could take the form of a final paragraph or set of paragraphs. If you are working on a scifi novel, then the conclusion might be an entire chapter or two. Don't end with common cliche endings, which will disappoint your reader. For example, don't end your story like this: A blinding light pierced my eyes, so I lifted my hand to shield them. At that moment, I felt the cocoon of soft blankets around me and the comfort of my pillow. I opened my eyes, realizing it had all been a dream.","completion":"Your story's conclusion should leave the reader with something to think about, regardless of genre.

Dissociate from the situation. Think logically. Know emotions have their place.","completion":"Self-sabotaging thoughts are destructive and limiting beliefs that hold you back from reaching your full potential. These thoughts can manifest in various ways, such as negative self-talk, self-doubt, and limiting beliefs. To banish them, you need to first detach yourself from the situation and stop anticipating the future. It is crucial to think logically and objectively and examine the evidence to challenge your self-sabotaging thoughts. One effective way to do this is by dissociating yourself from the situation at hand. Step back and evaluate the situation from an objective point of view. This can help you identify any patterns or habits that may be contributing to your self-sabotaging thoughts. Once you have identified these patterns, you can work on changing your mindset and behavior to break the cycle. It is important to understand that emotions have their place in the process of banishing self-sabotaging thoughts. Acknowledge your feelings and accept them without judgment. However, don't allow them to control your actions or thoughts. Instead, channel your emotions into positive actions such as exercise or creative projects. Developing a positive attitude, being kind to yourself, and practicing self-care are also essential in overcoming self-sabotaging thoughts. Positive self-talk and affirmations can help to build self-confidence and provide a sense of empowerment. In conclusion, banishing self-sabotaging thoughts is not an easy task, but with persistence and determination, it is achievable. By dissociating from the situation, thinking logically, and acknowledging but not being controlled by emotions, you can break the cycle of self-sabotage and achieve your goals."},{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the Idiot Abroad in the programme of the same name?

If the inductance is large enough, the energy will generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solidstate switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a lowvalue resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistorcapacitor combinations are available in a single package.

However, there is no readily available data on how many of those touchdowns were less than 10 yards long. To determine the number of passing touchdowns that measured less than 10 yards long, one would need to individually analyze each touchdown scored during the 2019 season and measure the distance of the pass from the line of scrimmage to the point where the ball was caught in the end zone. This task would require a significant amount of time and resources. Additionally, it's important to note that the distance of a touchdown pass does not necessarily equate to its difficulty. Some of the most memorable and impressive touchdown passes in NFL history have been for short yardage.

Understand what growth charts can show you. Try to refrain from taking your own measurements until your child is older.","completion":"Growth charts are an essential tool for tracking a child's growth and development since birth. They provide parents and healthcare providers with an easy-to-read visual representation of the child's height and weight measurements at different ages, helping them to identify potential growth issues. However, not all growth charts are alike, and there are several types, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts, which are the most commonly used in the US. It is critical to ensure that your child's measurements are taken accurately, and the best way to do this is through a pediatrician. Pediatricians have specialized training and tools to measure children's growth accurately, giving parents confidence in the accuracy of the results. Understanding what growth charts can show is also crucial. While a child's growth may seem slow or fast, the growth chart must consider their age, gender, and other factors, such as premature birth, to accurately assess their health status. The pediatrician can use growth charts to identify whether a child may have growth issues such as overweight, obesity or possible malnutrition. Lastly, parents are advised to refrain from taking their own measurements until the child is older. Measuring a child at home can be challenging, and parents who do it frequently may not be aware of any variations in the measurement process that could make the results be inaccurate. In conclusion, growth charts are an essential tool for monitoring a child's health status and development. By ensuring accurate measurements are taken and understanding what the charts represent, parents can help their child achieve good health and development. Pediatricians play a crucial role in this process, and parents should rely on them for accurate measurements and interpretation of the results."},{"prompt":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: bathroom, mirror, sink, window","completion":"The bathroom has a mirror above the sink and a window for natural light."},{"prompt":"Does the sentence Currently, the army is divided into the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. answer the question The Air Defense Artillery is a branch of what?

Prompted by legislation in various countries mandating increased bulb efficiency, new hybrid incandescent bulbs have been introduced by Philips. The Halogena Energy Saver incandescents can produce about 23 lm/W; about 30 percent more efficient than traditional incandescents, by using a reflective capsule to reflect formerly wasted infrared radiation back to the filament from which it can be reemitted as visible light. This concept was pioneered by DuroTest in 1980 with a commercial product that produced 29.8 lm/W.

Before you start, you'll need to obtain or purchase an incubator. Once you have an incubator, it's time to clean it thoroughly to ensure that it's ready for use. After cleaning the incubator, find an appropriate spot to place it. The location should have minimal temperature fluctuations, as this can affect the incubator's temperature, and ultimately the hatch rate of your eggs. Once you've selected the perfect location, plug in the incubator's cord into an electric outlet to begin heating up the incubator. To create the ideal environment for your eggs, add warm water to the incubator's humidity pan. This will help maintain the necessary humidity levels needed for hatching. You should then calibrate the incubator's temperature to ensure that it's within the range that's optimal for hatching. This typically ranges between 99 and 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Once the temperature is calibrated, give the incubator 24 hours to adjust and re-check the temperature again. It's important to ensure that the temperature stays within the desired range throughout the hatching process. Finally, obtain fertile eggs for hatching. It's important to ensure that the eggs are from a reliable source, as this can significantly affect the hatch rate. Place the eggs in the incubator and wait for a couple of weeks for them to hatch. In conclusion, hatching eggs can be a rewarding experience. With careful preparation and attention to detail, you can increase your chances of a successful hatch.

This has led to a significant shift in the way companies approach energy generation and consumption. Secondly, there has been a greater emphasis on sustainable practices, as companies look to reduce their impact on the environment. This has led to a wave of innovation in terms of product design and manufacturing processes. Lastly, the rise of digital technologies has transformed the manufacturing industry, enabling greater efficiency and productivity. This has also created new opportunities for businesses to leverage data and analytics to improve their operations. Given these changes, it is essential that we stay up to date with the latest trends and developments in the industry.

However, before making the decision to work from home, there are a few important factors to consider. Firstly, it's crucial to determine if you have a quiet space that you can use for working. This space should be free from distractions and noise, allowing you to focus on your work without interruptions. It could be a dedicated home office space, or even just a quiet corner of your home where you can set up a desk and chair. Once you have a quiet space, it's important to plan a work schedule that works for you. This schedule should be designed to allow you to achieve your work goals while also being flexible enough to accommodate other commitments, such as family or personal activities. Set specific work hours and stick to them as much as possible, as this will help you maintain a good work-life balance. Speaking of work-life balance, it's also important to ensure that you will have time to devote to activities outside of work. This could include hobbies, social activities, or simply spending time with loved ones. A healthy work-life balance is essential to maintaining a positive mental health and overall well-being. Finally, it's important to rate how important working from home is to your overall success. Working from home can provide many benefits, such as increased flexibility and reduced commute time. However, it's important to recognize that it may not be the best fit for every individual or every job. Be honest with yourself about your skills, strengths, and weaknesses, and determine if working from home is the best path for you. In conclusion, working from home can be a great option for many individuals, but it's important to carefully consider all the factors before making the decision to work remotely. Ensure that you have a quiet space, plan a work schedule that works for you, maintain a healthy work-life balance, and rate how important working from home is to your overall success.

At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope.

It is essential to be careful when charging e-cigarettes, and avoid leaving them unattended for prolonged periods or charging them close to flammable materials. The safety guidance issued by fire chiefs in Yorkshire highlighted the importance of ensuring that e-cigarettes are charged only with the recommended charger and that the power supply is suitable for the device. It was also recommended to charge e-cigarettes on a hard, flat surface to avoid overheating and to not charge them overnight.

You can do this by simply lifting it up and out of the drain. Next, twist the shower drain body anticlockwise to remove it. This may take a bit of elbow grease, but with some effort, it should come off easily. Once the shower drain body is removed, it's time to clean it.

One thing is to build bodies. They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any nonliving matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms.
