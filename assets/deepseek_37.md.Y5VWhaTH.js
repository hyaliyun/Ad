By choosing classic styles and defining a color palette, you can create a foundation that will serve you well for years to come.

First things first: classic styles. These are the pieces that never go out of fashion and always look chic. Some examples include a well-tailored blazer, a simple white t-shirt, a little black dress, and a pair of perfectly fitting jeans. By investing in these timeless pieces, you can create a wardrobe that will always look current and sophisticated. Once you've settled on the classic styles that work for you, it's time to choose a color palette. This can be as simple as selecting a few colors that complement your skin tone and hair color. Stick to neutrals like black, white, and gray, and add pops of color with accessories or statement pieces. With your style and color preferences in mind, you can start selecting specific pieces. Tops are a great place to start, as they can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. Look for styles that flatter your body type, whether that's a fitted t-shirt or a flowy blouse. Bottoms are equally important, and you'll want to have a variety of styles on hand. Think jeans, skirts, shorts, and trousers in a range of cuts and colors. Dresses are also a great option, providing a one-and-done outfit that can be accessorized in a variety of ways. Speaking of accessories, they can truly make or break an outfit. Scarves, belts, jewelry, and hats can all add interest and personality to even the most basic outfit. And of course, you can't forget about shoes. Select a few versatile styles that can be worn with a variety of outfits, like a classic pump or a sleek ankle boot. Finally, it's time to put everything together.

He is remembered for his role in the Battle of Damascus, which took place in 634 AD during the early Islamic conquests. At the time, Damascus was a heavily fortified city under the control of the Byzantine Empire. It was a strategic center of trade and commerce, and a key military stronghold in the region. The Arab armies, under the leadership of Khalid ibn al-Walid, marched towards Damascus with the intention of capturing it and expanding their territory. Zuqan, as the governor of Damascus, was tasked with defending the city. He gathered a large contingent of soldiers and prepared for a fierce battle. However, despite his efforts, the Arab forces were able to breach the city's defenses and gain control of the city after a week-long siege. It is unclear how much direct fighting Zuqan actually participated in during the battle. Most accounts of the battle focus on the broader strategic movements of the armies and the tactics employed by the Arab armies. Nonetheless, as the governor of Damascus, Zuqan was responsible for the city's defense and his actions would have had a significant impact on the outcome of the battle. Despite the defeat, Zuqan continued to play an important role in the region as a loyalist to the Umayyad Caliphate. He served as governor of several other cities, including Homs and Tripoli. Over time, the early Islamic conquests expanded and transformed the political and cultural landscape of the region, and Zuqan's legacy would be largely overshadowed by the larger events of this period. Nonetheless, his role in the Battle of Damascus remains an important moment in the early history of the Islamic Empire."},{"prompt":"This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure.

Use “S” to get points from your opponent’s best plays. Extend words when you can. Try to play a bingo.","completion":"Scrabble is a classic game loved by people of all ages. While it may seem like a game of luck, there are certain strategies that can increase your chances of winning. One of the best ways to score higher points in Scrabble is to memorize high scoring words that utilize tiles like J, Q, X, and Z. Tiles such as J, Q, X, and Z can be difficult to use in regular words, but when combined with other letters, they can lead to high scoring plays. For instance, the word “qi” (a Chinese term for life force) contains both a Q and an I, making it worth 11 points. Similarly, you can use the letter X in words like \\"ox\\" or \\"ax\\" to earn 9 and 10 points, respectively. Another strategy in Scrabble is to use the “S” tile to earn points from your opponent’s best plays. You can add an S to the end of a word to make it plural, earning points for both the original word and the new pluralized word. For instance, if your opponent plays “cat,” you could play “cats” and earn points for both words. You can also extend words to earn extra points. For instance, the word “box” can be extended to “boxer” with the addition of the letters “e” and “r”. This would earn additional points for the extra letters and for extending the word. Finally, try to play a bingo, which is using all seven letter tiles at once. This earns a bonus 50 points on top of the point value of the word played. Combining this strategy with high scoring letters can lead to a significant increase in your points. In conclusion, memorizing high scoring words with tiles such as J, Q, X, and Z, using the “S” tile to earn points from opponent’s plays, extending words, and playing a bingo are all strategies to increase your chances of winning in Scrabble. With practice and some luck, you can become a Scrabble champion."},{"prompt":"This apartment features a stovetop microwave and kitchenware What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","completion":"The given sentence is already correctly punctuated."},{"prompt":"On July 24, 2017, Gasol resigned with the Spurs.

It was a response to the growing administrative and economic challenges faced by the Russian authorities in the region, which included the spread of nomadic populations, the expansion of agriculture and industry, and the need to maintain law and order. Over the next few decades, the Steppe Commission worked to implement a range of reforms, including the establishment of new administrative structures, the promotion of settlement and agricultural development, and the regulation of migration and transport. One of the key initiatives of the Steppe Commission was the drafting of regulations for the governance of specific oblasts, or provinces, in the region. This included Turgay Oblast, Ural Oblast, Akmolinsk Oblast, and Semipalatinsk Oblast. These regions were among the most complex and challenging to govern, given their size, diversity, and strategic importance. It was not until 1882, seventeen years after the formation of the Steppe Commission, that Tsar Alexander II of Russia signed a draft Regulation on the governance of these oblasts. The regulation aimed to establish clear and consistent rules for the governance of these regions, including the allocation of resources, the promotion of economic development, and the maintenance of law and order. Despite these efforts, the governance of the Steppe region remained a challenge for the Russian Empire, particularly as the 19th century came to a close. The region continued to experience political instability, economic underdevelopment, and social tensions, which would ultimately contribute to the collapse of the Empire in 1917.

She is good in a number of other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant. Her singing is not funny at all, in fact it is downright beautiful, but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it.

The use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of Kitty Carlisle's role in the Marx Brothers' A Night At The Opera, but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in Opera, and McIntyre (perhaps more in other performances than here) exhibited a comedic talent of her own that Carlisle never did.

There are various types of cleaners available in the market, so it's important to choose one that's suitable for the type of stain you're dealing with. For example, if you have a grease stain, you'll need a degreaser cleaner. Once you have your cleaning solution, the next step is to blot the area with the cleaner. Make sure you don't rub the stain, as this can spread it further. Instead, use a clean cloth to dab the area until the stain starts to fade. After blotting the area, take a clean cloth and continue blotting until the stain is completely gone. If the stain persists, don't give up just yet. Tough stains may require the use of upholstery cleaner. Apply the cleaner to the stain and follow the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, rinse the area with water and use a clean cloth to dry it. It's essential to dry the upholstery thoroughly to prevent any water damage or mold growth. In conclusion, cleaning upholstery stains is not as daunting as it seems.

Give the entire wig a final spritz with water. Let your wig dry for several hours, combing every 30 minutes.","completion":"Wigs are a great accessory to change your hairstyle without committing to a cut or color change. However, once you have chosen the perfect wig, it is essential to know how to style and maintain it to keep it looking its best. One of the most crucial steps is to comb and spritz the hair regularly. The first step is to comb out the bangs to give them the desired style. A wig's bangs often look flat or crooked due to packaging, shipping, or simply being in storage for an extended time. Using a comb or brush, gently tease out any tangles or knots carefully. Be cautious and avoid using damaged or harsh combs, as they may damage the wig beyond repair. You can use a wig comb that features wide teeth and gentle bristles that won’t harm the fibers. Next, style the wig to the desired look. You may use a hair straightener, curling iron, or any other tool that is safe for synthetic or natural wigs. It is crucial to ensure that the heat setting is suitable for your wig before you expose it to any heat source. If using a hair straightener, place the hair iron above the locks and slowly but smoothly pull downwards, keeping the hair taut enough to avoid missing any strands. For a curling iron, wrap sections of hair around the barrel and hold for 5-10 seconds before releasing. After the styling process, it is essential to give the entire wig a final spritz with water. This step ensures that the hairspray, gel, or other styling products are evenly distributed throughout the hair. Ensure you don't oversaturate the wig with water to prevent it from becoming too heavy or leaving a musty smell. Finally, let your wig dry for several hours, combing every 30 minutes. Place it on a wig stand or mannequin head to restore its shape and prevent any wrinkling or bending of the hair fibers. Comb the wig every 30 minutes to avoid matting or tangling. Ensure it dries completely before storing it away. In conclusion, styling and maintaining a wig can be challenging, but with the right tools and techniques, you can keep your wig looking fresh, fluffy, and fabulous for a long time. The bangs should be combed out before styling, and the wig should be spritzed with water before drying. Give your wig time to dry before any final touches or storage. Remember, when handled with care, a wig can give you the confidence to take on any challenge with style."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this Gather supplies.

However, these quick and easy options come with a price - they are often high in unhealthy additives, preservatives, and excess sugar or sodium. To maintain a diet that is both nutritious and tasty, it's important to be mindful of the types of foods and drinks we consume. One of the simplest steps to take is to avoid canned or bottled beverages, such as soda or energy drinks, which often contain high levels of sugar or artificial sweeteners. Instead, opt for water, freshly brewed tea, or pure fruit juice. Another crucial step is to reduce your intake of fast food, which can be loaded with unhealthy saturated fats, high levels of sodium, and processed ingredients. When eating out, try to choose healthier options like salads, grilled chicken, or sandwiches with whole grain bread. When it comes to pre-packaged meals, it's important to read labels carefully and avoid items that contain added sugars, trans fats, or high levels of sodium. While there are some healthy and convenient options available, such as pre-packaged salads or fresh fruit cups, it's always best to prepare your meals at home using fresh, whole ingredients whenever possible. Finally, while breakfast cereals and granola bars can be an excellent source of fiber and nutrients, they can also be loaded with sugar and artificial additives. To make the healthiest choices, choose cereals that are low in added sugar and made with whole grains, and look for granola bars that are made with whole ingredients like nuts and dried fruit.

Labour questions if safety corners have been cut and the job rushed to prevent national humiliation.

However, the carriageway is only open to cars and lorries under 7.5 tonnes, with buses and lorries over that limit being diverted. This has raised concerns among the Labour party, which has questioned whether safety corners have been cut so that the job could be rushed to prevent national humiliation. The repair works on the motorway were complex, but it is unclear if the rush to open the road has compromised its integrity. Safeguards are critical, especially when dealing with transportation infrastructure – risk-taking is simply unacceptable. It is essential to ensure that the repairs were done correctly, and that the opening of the motorway to traffic has not put drivers' lives at risk. The decision to divert buses and lorries above 7.5 tonnes raises concerns about the impact on local traffic. The diversion will cause problems and inconvenience for those attempting to navigate their way across the area. Urgent action must be taken to mitigate the impact on traffic, ensuring that the diversion does not create problems for local communities. Moreover, the staffing shortage at Heathrow is causing significant delays for Olympic visitors. This situation is unacceptable, and more needs to be done to address these shortcomings. Visitors who come to the UK to participate in the Olympics must be able to travel with ease and without undue hardships. In conclusion, the reopening of the A4 motorway to traffic raises serious concerns regarding the safety of the road's integrity. It is essential that thorough checks are done to ensure the road isn't facing any risks. Additionally, action should be taken to reduce the impact of the diversion on local traffic, and the staffing shortage at Heathrow must be tackled to ensure visitors don't face long delays. These problems must be addressed to ensure that the Olympics are a success, and that visitors feel welcome in the UK."},{"prompt":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: a man pour wine during lunch on rural tourism which is in a beautiful nature on countryside","completion":"man, pour, wine, lunch, rural tourism, beautiful, nature, countryside."},{"prompt":"Solve 56659 69 = 1142*b 3054 for b.","completion":"First, we need to isolate the variable b on one side of the equation.

It is known as the Kett's Rebellion, or the Norfolk Rebellion, and it was a popular uprising against the enclosure of common lands and the imposition of new religious practices in England. Led by Robert Kett, a farmer and tanner from Wymondham, the rebels marched on Norwich, the second-largest city in England at the time, and established a camp on nearby Mousehold Heath. The rebellion was fueled by a combination of economic grievances and religious dissent. Many commoners were angry about the enclosure of common lands by wealthy landowners, which restricted their access to grazing and agricultural land. At the same time, there was widespread dissatisfaction with the religious changes mandated by the young Edward VI, who had recently succeeded his father Henry VIII to the throne. Kett and his followers issued a manifesto known as the \\"Articles of Complaint\\", which outlined their grievances and demands for reform. These included the abolition of enclosures, fair rents for tenant farmers, and a return to the \\"old religion\\" of Catholicism. The rebellion attracted widespread support in the eastern counties of England, and Kett's forces grew to an estimated 16,000 men. They successfully repelled a royal army under the command of the Duke of Northumberland, but were eventually defeated by a larger force led by the Earl of Warwick. Kett was captured and executed for treason, and the rebellion was suppressed. Despite its ultimate failure, the Kett's Rebellion is often seen as a key moment in English social and political history. It highlighted the struggles of common people against the ruling elite, and demonstrated the potential for popular uprisings to challenge established power structures. The legacy of the rebellion can still be felt in Norfolk today, with a statue of Robert Kett standing in Norwich and a traditional folk song commemorating the events of 1549."},{"prompt":"Objective: To get to the brakes on a car for replacement.

This was true for the three children wounded in a 1999 shooting in Los Angeles, and it is just as true for the survivors of the 2012 Connecticut school shooting. Despite the passage of time, these survivors continue to struggle with the trauma they experienced. For many of these survivors, the trauma they experienced as children has followed them into their teenage years. In interviews, they speak of the difficulties they faced trying to recover from the shooting. One survivor, Ben Kadish, recalls feeling like he couldn't be an average child after the shooting. The long-term effects of school shootings on survivors are well-documented. Children who experience these traumatic events can develop a range of mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. These issues can persist well into adulthood, impacting survivors' ability to form relationships, pursue their education and career goals, and enjoy life. As we continue to grapple with the problem of mass shootings in the United States, it is important to remember the lasting impact of these events on survivors. We must do more to support them as they navigate a long and difficult road to recovery. We must also work to prevent future tragedies by advocating for sensible gun safety measures and investing in mental health resources for those in need. Only by taking these steps can we begin to heal the wounds of the past and build a safer, more secure future for all."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this Swipe down from the top of the screen of your Kindle Fire HD to reveal the menu.

According to the victim, a man in a pizza shop approached him and called him a 'ginger p****', which resulted in a physical altercation that left him with a broken jaw. Sadly, the attack didn't only result in physical injuries for Kosuth-Phillips. He also reported feeling depressed afterwards. When his parents watched the CCTV footage of the incident, it was the first time they had seen them cry. This incident highlights the issue of verbal and physical abuse that people with red hair experience, known as \\"gingerism\\". This phenomenon has been widely documented and it affects people with red hair in different ways, including isolation, bullying, and low self-esteem. Moreover, gingerism is a form of discrimination that often goes unnoticed and unreported. The story of Alex Kosuth-Phillips serves as a reminder that hate speech and aggression towards anyone, based on their physical appearance, is unacceptable. By reporting incidents of bullying and abuse, victims can receive the support they need and raise awareness of the issue. It is important to create a society where diversity is celebrated and where individuals feel safe regardless of how they look.

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.

The expedition also included a number of indigenous people from the Caribbean, who acted as interpreters for the Spaniards. Among the people who traveled to Mexico with Cortés were soldiers, sailors, and craftsmen. Many of the soldiers had gained experience fighting in previous conquests in the Caribbean, while others were brand new recruits who signed up for the expedition because they saw an opportunity to gain wealth and status. The sailors were responsible for navigating the ships that transported the expedition to Mexico. They also helped to construct a small fleet of ships that Cortés used to transport his soldiers around the Gulf of Mexico. The craftsmen included carpenters, blacksmiths, and masons, who were tasked with building fortifications and other structures that the Spaniards used to establish a foothold in Mexico. They also helped to repair and maintain the ships that transported the expedition. In addition to these Spanish participants, Cortés's expedition also included a number of indigenous allies from the Caribbean. These individuals acted as interpreters for the Spaniards and helped them to communicate with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.

The use in brakes improves safety, due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully, or faster rise time, up to 0.5 second faster[citation needed] than an incandescent bulb. This gives drivers behind more time to react. In a dual intensity circuit (rear markers and brakes) if the LEDs are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency, they can create a phantom array, where ghost images of the LED will appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array.

The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered nullhomotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole).

They also offer an alternative to traditional academic pathways, which may not be suitable for all students. Therefore, it is crucial that schools promote vocational opportunities alongside academic routes. However, the report suggests that schools are failing to do this. This lack of promotion may result in students missing out on valuable opportunities. The report also suggests that students may be making uninformed decisions about their future careers due to the lack of guidance. The Ofsted report provides a clear message that schools need to do better in providing adequate career advice to their students. It is essential that schools work to identify the strengths and interests of each student to offer them guidance that aligns with their aspirations. There is also a need for schools to work closely with local industries to provide students with insight into potential career options. This will help students to understand the skills and qualities that employers value, which will help them prepare for their chosen career path. In conclusion, schools need to do more to promote vocational training and apprenticeships.

Because state laws exist, polygamy is not actively prosecuted at the federal level, but the practice is considered \`\`against public policy'' and, accordingly, the U.S. government won't recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes (that is, would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other), even if they are legal in the country where bigamous marriage was celebrated.

Average house price in the capital has rocketed past £500,000. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"A comprehensive photography project documenting the last ten years has revealed that some areas of London remain unaffected by the financial crash while other pockets of the city have regenerated significantly. Since the project started, the average house price in the capital has increased dramatically, surpassing the £500,000 mark. The photography project was conducted by a group of talented photographers, who spent a decade capturing images of various parts of London. The images reveal stark differences between the various boroughs in terms of their financial prosperity and regeneration status. In some areas, the project found that pockets of London look untouched by the economic downturn, while in others, significant investments have been made to regenerate and rejuvenate previously run-down areas. This project's findings are confirmed by recent figures showing that the average house price in London has surged past £500,000. This rise has been significant, partly due to the regeneration of previously underdeveloped areas, which have now become desirable places to live. However, the soaring house prices have also made it harder for many people to get on the property ladder and caused concerns about pricing young people out of the market. Despite the clear disparities between different areas of the city, the photographs also reveal that London's diversity and multiculturalism remain thriving characteristics. Parts of the city are known for their vibrant and bustling communities, with a range of shops, eateries, and cultural experiences on offer. In conclusion, the ten-year-long photography project offers a fascinating insight into the differences between various areas of London concerning economic prosperity and regeneration. While the average house price in the capital has gone up in the past ten years, there are still parts of the city that remain untouched by the financial crash, while other previously neglected areas have experienced significant rejuvenation. It's important to acknowledge the benefits of this urban regeneration but also to address the implications of the rising house prices and their impact on affordable housing in the city."},{"prompt":"Answer this question.
