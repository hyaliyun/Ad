The construction of the Suez Canal began in 1859 and was completed in 1869. However, it wasn't until the First World War that the canal became a strategic point of interest. In 1914, the Ottoman Empire joined the First World War on the side of the Central Powers. With the Ottoman Empire situated to the east of the canal, it became a vulnerable point of attack. The first Ottoman attack on the canal occurred in February 1915 when a force of 18,000 soldiers attempted to invade the British-held city of Ismailia via the canal. However, they were repelled by British forces. For the next four years, the British and their allies launched numerous attacks against Ottoman positions in Egypt while also fortifying the canal's defenses. These efforts proved successful as the Ottomans were unable to successfully breach the canal again. In August 1919, the Ottomans signed the Treaty of Sèvres, which recognized the canal as an international waterway and ensured its protection from further attacks. In conclusion, the Suez Canal was defended from Ottoman attacks for approximately four years during the First World War."},{"prompt":"A sign outside the Peachtree Restaurant reads : Pray for Eric Rudolph .

Posttraumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP) is often cause by head injury. Symptoms include depression, obesity, fatigue and chronic pain.","completion":"Misdiagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a real concern among patients who are suffering from post-traumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP) caused by head injuries. PTHP is a condition that affects the pituitary gland, which is responsible for producing and regulating hormones that control various bodily functions. Symptoms of PTHP include depression, obesity, chronic pain, and intense fatigue, which could be mistaken for CFS. When the pituitary gland sustains damage following head injuries, there is a risk of PTHP developing. Patients with PTHP may experience imbalances in their crucial hormones, such as thyroid, testosterone or cortisol hormones. As a result, patients often experience symptoms such as lethargy, anxiety, mood disorders, weight issues, menstrual and libido problems, and cognitive difficulties. Unfortunately, it can be easy to misdiagnose PTHP as CFS because of the seemingly similar symptoms that these two conditions share. It is essential that doctors conducting assessments on patients fully investigate their medical history and seek out the root cause of their symptoms correctly. Medical practitioners who are treating patients with chronic fatigue should be well acquainted with PTHP and should have adequate knowledge about how to diagnose the condition. Early diagnosis and early treatment can improve the quality of life for patients and may prevent the exacerbation of severe symptoms which are associated with PTHP. In conclusion, patients who have sustained a head injury or trauma must be aware of PTHP and its symptoms so that they can seek medical assistance from professionals who can provide a prompt diagnosis and treatment. When medical practitioners correctly diagnose PTHP, patients can receive the best possible chances of recovery, making a significant difference in the lives of both patients and their families."},{"prompt":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","completion":"\\"Today's achievements have left me feeling grateful and inspired.

Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code.

The process of transitioning can be a deeply personal experience for those involved, and it can take time for everyone to adjust. For Wren, the decision to transition from a female to male was one that he made after much reflection and introspection. It involved coming out to his family and friends, who have supported him throughout his journey. One of the steps in Wren's transition involves taking injections to delay puberty. This is a common procedure for individuals who identify as transgender and want to take their time adjusting to their new gender before undergoing any permanent changes. Delaying puberty allows Wren to have more time to explore and understand his gender identity and what it means to live as a male in society. The decision to delay puberty is not an easy one, as it involves significant medical procedures and can have long-term effects on Wren's body. However, for Wren and his family, it was an essential step in his transition process. Wren's parents have been supportive of his journey and have helped him navigate the challenges that come with transitioning. Wren's journey highlights the importance of support and understanding for those who are going through the process of transitioning. For Wren, the decision to become his authentic self was one that involved courage, determination, and a deep understanding of who he is.

Stuff your boots to help them retain their shape.","completion":"Taking proper care of your boots is essential to ensure their longevity and to keep them in top condition. One of the key strategies to keep in mind is to avoid stressing the material. This means that you should avoid any actions or storage methods that place undue pressure on the material of the boot. One way to achieve this is to store your boots individually, instead of piling them on top of one another in a crowded closet or storage area. This can help to prevent dents, creases, or other types of damage that can occur when boots are stacked on top of each other. Another important tip for boot care is to stuff your boots when you're not wearing them. This can help them to retain their shape and prevent any sagging or deformation that can occur over time. There are a variety of materials that you can use for this purpose, including newspaper, tissue paper, or specially-designed boot shapers. Simply insert the insert into the boot, and leave it in place until you're ready to wear your boots again. With regular use, this can help to keep your boots looking great and feeling comfortable for years to come. In addition to these tips, there are many other strategies that you can use to care for your boots and protect them from damage. For example, you might want to consider investing in a protective spray or other type of finish that can help to repel water and other substances, preventing stains and other types of damage. You should also be sure to clean your boots regularly, using a soft brush or damp cloth to gently remove dirt and grime.

Understand the Direction of Force. Understand Net Force.","completion":"Understanding the Concepts of Acceleration and Force To understand the principles of motion and how objects move, it is important to first understand the basic concepts of acceleration and force. Acceleration is the rate at which an object changes its velocity over time. Force, on the other hand, is a push or pull that causes an object to move or change direction. The direction of acceleration is important in understanding how an object will move. Acceleration can be either positive or negative, which indicates whether an object is speeding up or slowing down. For example, if an object is moving in a straight line and its speed increases, its acceleration is considered positive. If it slows down, then its acceleration is considered negative. The direction of force is also important in understanding how an object will move. The amount and direction of force are both factors that contribute to an object's movement. If an object experiences a force that is stronger in one direction than another, it will move in the direction of the stronger force. Net force is the amount of force that is acting on an object overall. It takes into account all of the individual forces that are acting on the object and determines their overall effect. If an object experiences a net force in one direction, it will move in that direction. In summary, understanding the direction of acceleration, the direction of force, and net force is crucial in understanding how objects move. Science and engineering rely heavily on principles of motion, and a strong foundation of these basic concepts is essential."},{"prompt":"Pat: Who's coming tonight?

Many early and lowerend LD players had poor analog audio components, and many early discs had poorly mastered analog audio tracks, making digital soundtracks in any form most desirable to serious enthusiasts. Early DiscoVision and LaserDisc titles lacked the digital audio option, but many of those movies received digital sound in later reissues by Universal, and the quality of analog audio tracks generally got far better as time went on. Many discs that had originally carried old analog stereo tracks received new Dolby Stereo and Dolby Surround tracks instead, often in addition to digital tracks, helping boost sound quality. Later analog discs also applied CX Noise Reduction, which improved the signalnoise ratio of their audio.

The key to developing this skill is to be sincere in your approach and to consistently observe the subject in question. By doing so, you can improve both the depth of your understanding and observation. To begin with, it is important to approach the subject with an open mind and to be sincere in your observations. This means being honest with yourself about what you are seeing, even if it goes against your initial assumptions or expectations. By doing so, you can gain a more accurate understanding of the subject and avoid bias or preconceived notions. Once you have established a sincere approach, it is important to continue observing the subject over time. This allows you to notice patterns, changes, and nuances that may not have been immediately apparent. By consistently observing the subject, you can develop a deeper understanding of its nature and behavior. It is also important to focus on the details when observing a subject. This can involve paying attention to small movements, gestures, or changes in behavior that may be overlooked by others. By honing your observation skills in this way, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject and its significance. Ultimately, developing your levels of observation is a lifelong process that requires dedication and perseverance.

Before the 1950s, the department store held an eminent place in both Canada and Australia, during both the Great Depression and World War II. Since then, they have suffered from strong competition from specialist stores. Most recently the competition has intensified with the advent of largerscale superstores (Jones et al. 1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Competition was not the only reason for the department stores' weakening strength; the changing structure of cities also affected them. The compact and centralized 19th century city with its mass transit lines converging on the downtown was a perfect environment for department store growth. But as residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs, the large, downtown department stores became inconvenient and lost business to the newer suburban shopping malls. In 2003, U.S. department store sales were surpassed by bigbox store sales for the first time (though some stores may be classified as big box by physical layout and department store by merchandise).

The team currently sits in 7th place with 14 points from nine games, five points off league leaders Manchester City. Graeme Souness, a former Liverpool captain, has been one of the many critics of the team's performance. Souness has been particularly critical of Liverpool's reliance on Raheem Sterling, the team's star player who has been carrying much of the offensive load. But Souness has also taken issue with the team's defensive performance, specifically their tendency to concede \\"daft\\" goals. This has been a recurring issue for Liverpool, and one that has cost them points in several games. Despite the criticism, Liverpool fans remain optimistic for the rest of the season. The team has been known for its ability to bounce back from difficult situations in the past, and there is hope that they can turn their season around in the coming weeks. Brendan Rodgers, the team's manager, has also expressed confidence in his players. He has cited injuries as a major factor in the team's underwhelming start, and has promised that they will come back stronger once their key players are back in action.

Be on the lookout for bruises, scrapes, and other injuries that your child can't explain. However, bullying can also take many other forms, including verbal abuse, social ostracization, and cyberbullying. These may be more difficult to detect, but they can still have a serious impact on your child's well-being. Look for signs like anxiety, depression, withdrawal, and changes in eating or sleeping patterns. If you suspect that your child is being bullied, the best thing you can do is talk to him about it. Ask him if anything has been bothering him at school or online, and let him know that you're there to support him. If he doesn't want to talk about it, try asking his friends or classmates if they've noticed anything out of the ordinary. You can also arrange a meeting with your child's teacher or coach to discuss your concerns and come up with a plan to address the situation. Above all, it's important to take your child's experiences seriously. Even if you don't think the bullying is a big deal, your child may be suffering in ways that you can't see. By being attentive and supportive, you can help your child feel heard, valued, and protected. Together, you can work to put an end to bullying and create a safer, happier environment for everyone."},{"prompt":"Answer the question about text: Even though i am a rocker let 's say , i had never visited TP .

Of course, it would be a mistake to ignore the geopolitical dimensions of this dynamic. The preponderance of Christian merchants owed not to any innate business sense on their part, although plenty of European observers were keen on making this point.

Mix the solution before use.","completion":"Making solutions of various types is a common practice in different fields, from chemistry to medicine, and even in cleaning products. But the process of making a solution is not as simple as just mixing two or more substances together. To make an effective solution, it is essential to follow a few essential steps. The first step is to collect all the supplies required for making the solution. This includes the raw materials like chemicals, solvents, and water, along with the equipment necessary for mixing, measuring, and storing the solution. It is crucial to read the label on every ingredient to ensure that the correct amount of each substance is measured for the solution. The next step is to combine the ingredients in the right proportions. The measurements for each component should be precise to achieve the desired outcome. Mixing the ingredients haphazardly or in the wrong amounts can result in a chemical reaction that can be dangerous or ineffective. After combining the ingredients, the solution should rest for some time. This allows the chemicals to interact with each other and dissolve properly, leading to a more homogeneous mixture. Resting times may vary depending on the specific solution being made, and it's important to follow the instructions carefully. Finally, before using the solution, it is essential to mix it properly. Even when a solution has rested adequately, settling of the components can occur, resulting in an uneven mixture. Before applying or using the solution, it should be mixed thoroughly to ensure that all the ingredients are evenly distributed. In conclusion, making a solution involves collecting the necessary supplies, carefully combining the ingredients, letting the mixture rest and, finally, mixing it correctly. Following these steps will help ensure that the solution works effectively and achieves the desired result."},{"prompt":"Yes.

However, soaking alone is not enough to ensure that your hands stay hydrated and protected. To truly lock in moisture and keep your hands feeling soft and supple, consider wearing moisture-locking gloves after soaking. These specialized gloves are designed to trap in the natural moisture of your skin, preventing it from evaporating or being absorbed by other surfaces. They can be made from a variety of materials, such as cotton or silk, and are often infused with moisturizing ingredients like shea butter, jojoba oil, or aloe vera.

In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an exciting fact directly led to a physiological response, known as emotion. To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist Carl Lange also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the James–Lange theory. As James wrote, the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, is the emotion.

For short term projects, any container with air holes will do. However, if you plan on keeping them for a longer period of time, it's best to invest in a larger tank or terrarium such as a Kritter Keeper. One crucial factor to consider is air circulation. Snails require fresh air to breathe, so make sure your tank or terrarium has adequate ventilation. Keeping the tank at room temperature is also important, as extreme heat or cold can be harmful to your pet snails. Before setting up the habitat, purchase terrarium soil or earth from outside to create a natural environment for your snails to thrive. Add a layer of natural materials on top of the soil, such as leaves or small twigs, to provide your snails with hiding spots and areas to explore. Decorating your snail's home is a fun way to personalize their space. Use non-toxic materials such as rocks or plants, but be cautious not to overcrowd the space. Snails require plenty of roaming space, so make sure you don't add too many decorations. It's also important to attach a heavy or fastened lid to the tank or terrarium to prevent escape. Snails are adept at finding their way out of containers, so make sure the lid is secure. Lastly, find snails to put in your container. You can purchase them from a pet store or gather them from your garden or local area. Remember to handle your snails gently and only touch them with wet hands to prevent damaging their fragile shells. By following these simple steps, you can create a safe, natural, and personalized environment for your pet snails to thrive in."},{"prompt":"Next question: who plays sophie's boyfriend in mamma mia?","completion":"The name of Sophie's boyfriend in Mamma Mia is Sky and he is played by actor Dominic Cooper."},{"prompt":"Add punctuation: Latest visit 19 September 2004 2134","completion":"Latest visit: 19 September 2004, 21:34."},{"prompt":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","completion":"\\"Today is a beautiful day!

Without knowing the details of the game in question, it is impossible to provide an exact answer to this question. However, we can take a look at some general statistics to understand the potential difference in yardage between the two types of plays. In general, a TD run will typically cover a shorter distance than a TD pass. According to NFL statistics, the average length of a touchdown run is around 10 yards, while the average length of a touchdown pass is around 25 yards. Of course, there are many factors that can influence the length of a play, including the skill of the players involved, the defensive strategies being used, and the specific situation in the game. That being said, we can make some educated guesses about the potential difference in yardage between a TD run by Rhodes and a TD pass caught by Gonzalez. If we assume that Rhodes's TD run was a relatively short one - say, around 5-10 yards - and that Gonzalez's TD catch was on the longer side - perhaps around 30-40 yards - then we might expect the difference in yardage to be somewhere in the range of 20-35 yards. Again, it's important to note that these are just estimates, and the actual difference in yardage could be larger or smaller depending on a wide range of variables. Ultimately, the best way to get an accurate answer to this question would be to look up the specific game in which these plays occurred and check the game statistics.

On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

First and foremost, it's crucial to clean the affected area thoroughly to prevent infection. Once the area is clean, it's time to start applying some of the remedies that will help with pain and promote healing. One of the first things to try is applying powder. This can be useful in areas where sweat or moisture may accumulate, such as under the arms or in between toes. It will help to keep the area dry and reduce friction, which can be especially helpful for rashes or chafing. If there are any cuts or scrapes, it's a good idea to apply an ointment to the affected area. Ointments can help to speed up the healing process and prevent scarring. There are a wide variety of ointments to choose from, such as Neosporin or Aquaphor, so be sure to find one that's appropriate for your particular injury. If the area is swollen or inflamed, using ice packs can help to reduce the swelling and alleviate the pain. Ice packs can be applied for 20 minutes at a time, a few times a day. Another option is to use soothing gels or oils, such as aloe vera or lavender oil, to provide relief to the affected area. For some injuries, taking a soothing bath may be helpful. Adding Epsom salts or essential oils can provide additional relief for sore muscles or bruising. For an extra pampering experience, try adding some candles and calming music to help you relax. Lastly, it's important to know when it's time to see a doctor. If an injury is severe or shows signs of infection, it's best to seek professional medical help. Signs of infection include redness, swelling, warmth, and discharge from the affected area. In conclusion, taking care of injuries at home can be a simple process. By following these steps of cleaning the area, applying powder, an ointment or ice packs, and taking soothing baths or gels, you can speed up healing and get back to your daily routine. Just remember to seek medical attention if the injury shows signs of infection."},{"prompt":"Queen (band): After fans noticed Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, rumours began to spread that Mercury was suffering from AIDS.

Denture adhesive loosens naturally in the presence of water or moisture. As a result, most denture adhesives contain a substance that absorbs saliva in order to prevent the moisture in your mouth from loosening the adhesive. OPTIONS: Wait a few days and the adhesive will begin loosening. Check your denture adhesive every three days to see if it has loosened.

Adderall is central nervous system stimulant combining amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"A woman from Florida named Heather McAuliffe has been caught red-handed after admitting that she had given her son 5mg of her ADHD medication, Adderall. Heather, who is 39 years old, had emailed her son's teacher asking for updates on his behavior after consuming the drug without a prescription. Adderall is a central nervous system stimulant that contains a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. This medication is commonly prescribed to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. However, it is a controlled substance, which means that it is illegal to use or distribute it without a prescription. Heather's move to give her son Adderall was not only illegal, but also potentially dangerous. The drug can cause side effects such as insomnia, loss of appetite, and even heart problems. Children who are not diagnosed with ADHD and take the medication can experience adverse effects such as nervousness, agitation, and behavior changes. The fact that Heather contacted her son's teacher to ask for updates on his behavior after giving him the drug shows that she knew that it was not a legal or ethical practice. It is unclear whether Heather had been taking the medication herself, and if so, whether she was doing so under a doctor's supervision. The incident serves as a reminder that using controlled substances without a prescription is not only illegal but also potentially dangerous.

Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron, that when MarieAntoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it. Price had rejoiced that the French king had been led in triumph during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on MarieAntoinette—was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman.

This occurred several times during different games, and it is not as uncommon as one may think. A field goal of 5 yards is typically attempted when a team is within the opponent's 10 yard line, but they are unable to score a touchdown or gain any more yards on the field. In this case, the team can choose to kick a field goal from the 5 yard line, which is a high percentage play for NFL kickers. In fact, the majority of NFL field goals are made from this range, as the shorter distance makes it easier to accurately kick the ball through the goal post. However, this doesn't mean that it is a guaranteed success. Kicking a field goal still require precision and skill, so even from a distance of just 5 yards, there is still a chance of missing the target.

The company reverted in name to Universal Pictures. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In 1964 MCA formed Universal City Studios, Inc., merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as Universal Television in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a fullblown, Afilm movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964.
