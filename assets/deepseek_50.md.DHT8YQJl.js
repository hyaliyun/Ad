A number of British architects in the second half of the century took up the expressive challenge of the Doric from their aristocratic patrons, including Joseph Bonomi and John Soane, but it was to remain the private enthusiasm of connoisseurs up to the first decade of the 19th century.

How to forget the boy you loved Taper off contact. Oftentimes, people hang on to their exes past what is healthy. If someone is absent from your life, it's best to work on letting go of the relationship. OPTIONS: If the person was in your life for years and you no longer have any connection to the person, it's best to work on keeping the relationship secure. Schedule something private like going to a movie or seeing a concert with the person. The first step is tapering off contact. People develop strong emotional attachments in love. If someone you love has cheated on you, it may be a good idea to lessen contact with that person as well. If it's with someone new, you may need to reduce contact.

It is important to understand the complications that can arise from the flu, especially for those who are at a higher risk, such as children, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems. The flu can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, brain inflammation, and even death. Getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to reduce the risk of these complications. While the flu vaccine is generally safe, it is important to be aware of the potential side effects. Common side effects can include soreness at the injection site, fever, and body aches. These side effects are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days. However, in rare cases, more serious side effects can occur.

Disneyland. He claimed his son had undergone.

However, it has come to light that at least £250,000 of the funds was deposited into his own personal bank account. Wright has been accused of using some of this money for personal purposes, such as a lavish trip to the Bahamas and Disneyland that cost him £60,000. Wright has attempted to justify his expenses by claiming that his son required intensive medical treatment daily during the trip. While this may be a reasonable excuse, experts point out that £60,000 is an exorbitant amount to spend, even if it is for medical treatment. Furthermore, concern over the misappropriation of charity funds has led to an investigation into Wright's activities. The revelation of Wright's alleged misuse of charity funds highlights a significant problem in the charity sector. Charities depend on public trust and support, and misconduct by those who are supposed to be working for the greater good can have long-lasting repercussions. The public may lose faith in the sector, causing donations to decrease, and ultimately hurting those who depend on the charities' services. It is vital to establish tight rules and regulations governing the administration of charity funds to prevent a similar incident from happening in the future. The Charity Commission is the official regulator, and they have issued numerous guidelines to ensure that charities are operated transparently and effectively. The public can also research charities and carefully consider where they donate their money. In conclusion, Kevin Wright's alleged misuse of charity funds is a severe offense and highlights the importance of ethics and transparency in the charity sector. Those who work for charities must recognize their responsibilities and be accountable for their actions. Furthermore, it is essential that the public continues to support charities while remaining vigilant about the organizations to which they donate."},{"prompt":"Attributes: name = The Phoenix, food = Chinese, customer rating = low, area = riverside.

Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients.

You can predict the angle of the reflected light. Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny.

However, for beginners who are just starting, learning how to cast a fishing reel can be a daunting task. One of the key elements to casting your reel successfully is understanding the mechanics behind it. To get started with casting your reel, the first thing to do is to adjust the reel's drag and tension. This is important as it helps you control how much resistance your fish feels when they pull on your line. Once you have the drag and tension set, reel your lure in about 12-15 inches from the rod tip. Next, it's time to hold the rod. Turn the rod so that the reel crank and spool are on top. Grip the rod with your thumb resting over the reel spool. This position offers a secure yet flexible grip that lets you control your cast without your hand being too loose or tight. To cast, press the reel spool release button with the thumb of your casting hand. Bring your casting arm up and back toward your shoulder, making sure to keep your elbow close to your side. As you start the forward motion, sweep the rod forward while removing your thumb from the spool wheel. This action releases the line, allowing it to fly through the air and land in the water. Finally, before the lure hits the water, it's important to brake the reel spool with your thumb just before it reaches the water's surface. This helps prevent the line from getting tangled in the water, which can be a frustrating experience. In conclusion, learning how to cast your fishing reel takes time and patience, but with this guide, you should be well on your way to catching your next big catch. Remember to set the drag and tension, grip the rod correctly, keep your elbow close to your body, and brake the reel spool just before the lure hits the water.

It is clear that incidents like this have no place in football, or indeed in any aspect of society. It is up to everyone- players, fans, and officials alike- to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting environment and to put an end to racism, once and for all. On a positive note, Alves' girlfriend posted a picture online shortly after the match which showed the player and his friends all eating bananas.

He was in his car, shooting video, when the lightning struck his arm and continued down to create a hole in the road. It all began with eerie calm, as seen in the initial footage, even showing a rainbow in the sky, before the lightning struck. Sheppard's video footage shows a cloud of smoke that was created by the crater. Being a storm chaser entails a certain level of risk - and Sheppard is no stranger to it. He regularly posts his chase videos on his social media accounts, where thousands of viewers watch in awe. Storm chasing is not just exciting, but many see it as educational and informative. By capturing footage of storms that would often be dangerous to experience firsthand, Sheppard allows people to get a glimpse of what Mother Nature is capable of. However, it's important to note that the risks outweigh the rewards. Many storm chasers have been killed while trying to capture footage of storms. In 2013, three storm chasers lost their lives while chasing an EF-3 tornado in Oklahoma. The risks to one's personal safety must always be taken into consideration when chasing storms. While Sheppard was lucky to survive the lightning strike, it's important to remember that not all storm chasers are as fortunate. The rush of adrenaline while chasing storms can be thrilling, but always be mindful of the risks. Storm chasing can be educational and enlightening, but it's important to prioritize safety above all else."},{"prompt":"Channel partners say the release of enterprise and SMB versions of Microsoft Operations Manager 2005 this week will boost Windows management but they #39;re not sure whether it will boost sales.

Tap Channel Settings. Slide the “Mute Channel” switch to the On position.","completion":"Discord is a widely popular communication platform that allows users to communicate through text, voice, and video with their friends, family, and colleagues. The platform provides users with servers that can host multiple channels within them, catering to different topics and interests. However, sometimes, users may join a channel that is too noisy or creates too many notifications, leading to distraction and loss of productivity. Fortunately, Discord provides an easy solution to this problem - muting channels. To mute a channel on Discord, you must first open the app on your device. Once open, tap the ☰ icon located in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. This will reveal a list of servers that you have joined or can join. Select the server that hosts the channel you wish to mute. After selecting the server, you will be taken to a list of channels within the server. Tap on the name of the channel you want to mute. A list of options will appear, including the ⁝ icon. Tap on ⁝ to reveal more settings. From the list of settings, select \\"Channel Settings,\\" which should be located at the bottom of the list. This will take you to a new screen where you will see various options for customizing the channel. The last setting on the list should be “Mute Channel.” Slide the switch to the right to turn it on, thus muting the channel. You will no longer receive notifications or hear any sounds from that channel. Muting channels can be incredibly useful, especially when you're trying to focus on a task or need to minimize distractions. It's a simple process that only takes a few seconds, and it can make a huge difference in your overall Discord experience. Remember that you can always unmute the channel anytime by following the same steps and sliding the “Mute Channel” switch to the off position."},{"prompt":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Crawling is a song by American rock band Linkin Park.

It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest.

Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations. Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes.

With the rise of credit and debit cards, it's becoming a less common choice, but it's still worth considering. The first benefit to paying with cash is that you can avoid interest charges. Credit cards can have interest rates as high as 30%, which means you'll pay that much more for the item you're buying. When you pay with cash, you know exactly how much you're spending, and there's no debt to worry about later. Another benefit to paying with cash is that you may be able to negotiate a better price. Cash is often preferred by merchants because they don't have to pay the fees that come with accepting credit cards. If you're willing to negotiate, you may be able to get a better deal on the item you want. Paying with cash can also help you limit your spending. When you set a cash budget for yourself, you can only spend as much money as you have. This can be a good way to avoid overspending and to make sure you stick to your financial goals. However, there are some downsides to paying with cash. For example, it can be inconvenient to carry around large amounts of money, and there's always the risk of losing it or having it stolen. Additionally, if you pay with cash, you won't have the protection that credit cards offer in case of fraud. In conclusion, using cash to make payments has its benefits and drawbacks. It can be a smart choice if you're looking to avoid interest charges or negotiate a better price. However, it's important to weigh the risks and consider how much you're willing to carry with you. Ultimately, the decision of whether to use cash or credit cards depends on your personal financial situation and preferences."},{"prompt":"Generate an approximately fifteenword sentence that describes all this data: Agremiação Sportiva Arapiraquense CHAIRMAN_TITLE President","completion":"The chairman of Agremiação Sportiva Arapiraquense holds the title of \\"President.\\""},{"prompt":"Sentence 1: That was when Natalia burst back into the room.

Ovodov identifies as a woman and claims that she has always felt like a woman inside, but cannot currently afford the operation. In Russia, transgender individuals must undergo a medical examination and provide proof of sex reassignment surgery or hormone therapy to legally change their gender on their passport. Ovodov's case challenges this requirement and raises questions about the rights of transgender individuals in Russia.

She has argued that her gender identity should be respected without any conditions, including the requirement for surgery or therapy. Her case comes at a time when the LGBTQ+ community in Russia is facing increased discrimination and persecution, with the government passing controversial laws that limit the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. Ovodov's struggle for recognition and acceptance shines a spotlight on the difficulties faced by transgender citizens in a society that discriminates against them. In spite of the legal difficulties and societal stigma, Ovodov remains determined to fight for her rights and the rights of the broader transgender community in Russia.

The study found that 24 percent of hip implants used in surgeries were not backed by sufficient evidence. This finding is cause for concern among patients who have undergone hip replacement surgeries. Among those patients are approximately 50,000 people who have received implants with \\"metal on metal\\" components. These types of implants have been linked to a higher failure rate and complications such as metal poisoning. As a result of the study's findings, patients with \\"metal on metal\\" hip replacements are advised to undergo annual checks to monitor the functioning of their implants. This recommendation could potentially affect a large number of patients who have undergone hip replacement surgeries, highlighting the importance of thorough research and evidence-based practices in the field of medicine. It's noteworthy that the study considered all hip implants used in surgeries in 2011. Therefore, it's possible that the lack of evidence supporting certain implants may persist beyond that year. This highlights the need for ongoing research to ensure that medical practices are based on the best available evidence. In conclusion, the recent study by Oxford University highlights the need for evidence-based practices in the field of medicine. Patients who have undergone hip replacement surgeries, especially those with \\"metal on metal\\" implants, should be vigilant in seeking regular check-ups to ensure the optimal functioning of their implants.

Our left brain is responsible for logical, analytical thinking, while our right brain is responsible for creativity, intuition, and holistic thinking. To tap into our right brain hemisphere, we can try using techniques such as brainstorming, mind mapping, and visualization. These techniques allow us to explore new ideas and think outside the box. When we brainstorm, we can generate a wide variety of ideas, even if some of them seem impractical at first. Mind mapping helps us organize our thoughts and ideas in a visually appealing way, allowing us to see connections that we may not have noticed before. Visualization involves imagining ourselves in different scenarios and picturing possible solutions. By using our right brain hemisphere, we can create solutions to problems that we might not have otherwise considered. We can come up with ideas that are fresh, innovative, and unique.

The Corfu European Council, held on June 19-20, 1994, aimed to strengthen the cooperation and integration among the European Union member states. A customs union was an important part of this effort, as it facilitated the movement of goods and services across borders and promoted trade. However, Greece felt that its interests were not adequately represented in the proposed customs union agreement. Specifically, Greece objected to the inclusion of Italy and Spain, two countries with whom it had territorial disputes. Greece believed that the inclusion of these countries would hurt its economic and political interests. Despite efforts to address Greece's concerns, including a special statement from the European Council, Greece remained steadfast in its opposition. As a result, the final implementation of the customs union was delayed until December 31, 1995, approximately 3 months after the Corfu European Council. The delay caused some friction among the member states, and raised questions about the efficacy of the European Union's decision-making process. It also highlighted the challenges of balancing the interests of individual member states with the broader objectives of the EU as a whole.

Mitchell, who hails from Roswell, New Mexico, the site of an infamous alleged UFO crash, claims that residents of the town were instructed by the military not to discuss their experiences. Mitchell, who was the sixth person to walk on the moon, has long been an advocate for greater transparency regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life. He claims that his own experiences as an astronaut have convinced him that intelligent life beyond our planet is not only possible, but likely. The former astronaut's claims echo those of other high-profile individuals who have suggested that governments are covering up information about UFO sightings and other evidence of extraterrestrial activity. However, many scientists and skeptics remain dubious, citing a lack of verifiable evidence to support such claims. Despite the controversy surrounding his assertions, Mitchell remains committed to increasing public awareness of the possibility of extraterrestrial life. He believes that a greater understanding of the universe around us is crucial to our survival as a species, and that we must be willing to accept the existence of other intelligent beings in order to make progress in this area.

Unless you're tech-savvy and eager to enjoy the new features, waiting to update is a wise course of action. While it's true that the new operating system brings a lot of great improvements, rushing to upgrade could ultimately lead to a worse user experience, and potential frustration. Apple is continuously upgrading their software to provide users with better features and security. With iOS 7, they have introduced a new and intuitive user interface, as well as improvements to Siri, the notification center, and many other features.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said he didn't alter footballs in AFC title game. Belichick says he has no idea how his team's footballs got deflated, as ESPN has reported. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The upcoming Super Bowl has taken an unexpected turn in the past week as allegations of deflated footballs have taken center stage. In the AFC Championship game between the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts, the Patriots were accused of using underinflated footballs to gain a competitive advantage. This has led to widespread speculation and denials from all parties involved, including Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick. According to recent reports, the NFL has assigned the Chicago Bears' equipment manager to oversee the handling of Super Bowl footballs to ensure that the integrity of the game is maintained. This decision comes after the controversy surrounding the AFC Championship game, in which the Patriots were accused of deflating footballs to make them easier to grip and throw. Tom Brady has vehemently denied any involvement in deflating footballs, stating in a press conference that he prefers his footballs at the league-mandated air pressure level. As for Belichick, he has also denied having any knowledge of how the game balls became deflated. ESPN had reported that an internal investigation by the NFL found that 11 of the 12 game balls used by the Patriots were underinflated by 2 pounds per square inch of air pressure. The NFL's response to this controversy has been swift and decisive, with many calling for severe punishments if the Patriots are found to have deliberately tampered with the footballs. As the Super Bowl approaches and tensions rise, it remains to be seen what will happen next in this ongoing scandal. One thing is for sure – the outcome of the game will be closely scrutinized, and the NFL will be under pressure to ensure that the integrity of the game is maintained at all times."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this Tour the school.

Generally, cranberries are ripe and ready to be picked between September and October. During this time, the berries will be a deep red color and plump to the touch. The timing of the harvest will ultimately depend on your location and the weather conditions in your area. It's also important to pick cranberries on a dry day. Wet or damp conditions can damage the berries and make them more susceptible to rotting. Additionally, the weather can impact how easy it is to pick the berries. A light rain or drizzle can make the harvesting process more challenging as the plants will be more slippery and difficult to navigate. Mechanical pickers are commonly used to harvest cranberries, and walking one through the fields is a relatively easy process. The machine will gently shake the plants, causing the berries to fall into a collection area. From there, the berries are sorted and transported to a processing facility. Overall, picking cranberries requires a bit of planning and attention to weather conditions. Knowing when to pick the berries and what equipment to use can make the process more efficient and ensure a high-quality product."},{"prompt":"What is the most logical next event?

However, it is worth mentioning that winning consecutive road games is considered a more challenging task than winning consecutive games overall. This is because winning on the road usually involves facing more difficult opponents, dealing with fatigue due to traveling, and dealing with hostile crowds. Despite the difficulty level, the Lakers managed to win 14 consecutive road games during the 2019-20 season. This not only helped them maintain their position at the top of the Western Conference standings but also proved their dominance on the court. It was a remarkable achievement for the team and their fans. On the other hand, winning 16 consecutive games overall was also an impressive feat for the Lakers. This streak occurred during the 2008-09 season when the Lakers were led by their star player, Kobe Bryant. They went on to win the NBA Championship that season, cementing their place in history as one of the greatest teams of all time. In conclusion, the Lakers won two more consecutive games overall than consecutive road games. However, the difficulty level of winning consecutive games on the road highlights the incredible feat they achieved during the 2019-20 season. Overall, the Lakers have set the standard high for future teams, and their legacy as a dominant force in basketball will live on for generations to come."},{"prompt":"Answer this question: what's the name of the new halloween movie??","completion":"The name of the new Halloween movie is \\"Halloween Kills\\"."},{"prompt":"ere is some data about a restaurant: name = Fitzbillies, eatType = coffee shop, food = Indian, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes.

Between 255246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of presentday Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the GrecoBactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the GrecoBactria dynasty.

Swap crisps for Twiglets, butter for lemon juice, whole milk for skimmed.","completion":"Christmas is a time when we indulge in lavish meals, delectable desserts, and unlimited snacks. It is also a time when we tend to overeat, leading us to consume three times a woman's daily recommended intake of calories on Christmas Day. According to studies, an average person can consume up to 6,000 calories on Christmas Day alone! But don't worry, there are ways to enjoy the festivities without compromising your health. Firstly, when it comes to the main course, try to avoid the turkey skin and opt for white meat instead of fattier dark meat. Cutting potatoes slightly larger for roasting can reduce the amount of fat they absorb during cooking. Also, if you prefer stuffing, go for a vegetarian option instead of sausage meat. This swap can be a healthier alternative as it contains fewer calories and is great for those who follow a vegetarian lifestyle. Another way to cut back on calories during Christmas is by switching your snacks. Instead of munching on crisps, you can opt for Twiglets. Twiglets are low in fat and calories and are an excellent source of fiber. Also, try to substitute butter with lemon juice while preparing dishes such as roasted veggies or turkey. This substitution will not only help in reducing calorie intake but also bring a zest of freshness to your dishes. Lastly, make small changes to your dairy products, such as swapping whole milk for skimmed. Skimmed milk is lower in calories and can help you cut back on saturated fats. You can sprinkle some cinnamon or nutmeg to enhance the flavor of skimmed milk. In conclusion, enjoying Christmas doesn't mean we have to sacrifice our health or fitness goals. By following simple swaps and making small changes, we can still relish our favorite foods without overindulging. So, let's make better food choices and embrace the festive season with a healthy, balanced approach."},{"prompt":"Triple: A.C. Lumezzane NUMBER_OF_MEMBERS 4150; A.C.

The formal occupation began in 1912, even though there were various other assaults by the U.S. in Nicaragua throughout this period. American military interventions in Nicaragua were designed to stop any other nation except the United States of America from building a Nicaraguan Canal. Nicaragua assumed a quasiprotectorate status under the 1916 BryanChamorro Treaty. But with the onset of the Great Depression and Augusto C.

Rinse your beans.","completion":"When it comes to cooking with dried beans, it's important to take a few extra steps to ensure that the finished product is top-quality. One of the most important steps in this process is to pick out any bad beans and rinse the remainder. Bad beans can be identified by discoloration, cracks, or irregular sizes. These beans may not cook evenly, and they may cause the final dish to have an off taste. It's important to take the time to pick out any bad beans before cooking to ensure that the final dish is delicious. Once you've picked out any bad beans, it's time to rinse the rest. Rinsing the beans helps to remove any dirt or debris that may have accumulated during the packaging and shipping process. This step is important because it ensures that the final dish is clean and free from any unwanted flavors or textures. To rinse the beans, simply place them in a colander and run them under cold water. Use your hands to gently rub the beans to ensure that they are thoroughly rinsed. This step should only take a few minutes, but it can make a big difference in the overall quality of the final dish. In summary, picking out bad beans and rinsing the remainder are two crucial steps when cooking with dried beans. These simple actions can help to ensure that the final dish is delicious, evenly cooked, and free of any unwanted flavors or textures. So the next time you're cooking with dried beans, be sure to take the time to pick out any bad beans and give the rest a thorough rinse.

This surprising finding sheds light on the complex genetic history of the region. The study, conducted by a team of researchers, aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of European populations. By analyzing the DNA of individuals from various regions, they were able to identify patterns that reveal the migration and mixing of populations throughout history. One of the most striking findings was that people in the UK have a significant genetic influence from Turkey, dating back only 1,000 years. This suggests that a group of Turkish migrants must have migrated to the region during the Middle Ages and left a lasting genetic legacy. This discovery is particularly significant because it challenges the commonly-held view that the UK has been largely isolated from such influences. Instead, it adds to the growing body of evidence that the region has been shaped by a complex interplay of migrations, invasions, and trading patterns throughout history. As further research is conducted, it is likely that even more fascinating insights into Europe's genetic history will come to light.

Some may argue that this approach reinforces traditional gender roles and goes against the principles of equality and mutual respect. One common belief is that a woman should always keep up her appearance to please her partner. While there's nothing wrong with wanting to look good for oneself and one's partner, it's essential to remember that appearances are only skin deep. A healthy relationship should be built on more than just physical attraction. Another common expectation is that women should be good cooks and serve their partners a nice meal. While cooking can be an enjoyable way to show love and care, the idea that women should be the primary providers of meals is outdated. Both partners should share the responsibility of cooking and household chores. Similarly, some believe that women should let their male partners watch sports without interruption. While it's important to respect one's partner's interests and hobbies, relationships should be about compromise and finding common ground. If one partner always dominates the TV, it can foster resentment and frustration. Finally, satisfying one's partner's desires is an essential aspect of a healthy sexual relationship. However, it doesn't mean that women should submit to their partner's every desire without regard for their own pleasure and preferences. Mutual consent and respect should always be the priority. In conclusion, while wanting to make one's partner happy is a natural desire, it's important to ensure that both partners are being respected and have equal say in the relationship. Gender roles and expectations should be challenged, and relationships should be built on mutual respect, trust, and understanding."},{"prompt":"Trying to collect every piece of metal which he thinks would help for something in the future Can you repeat this sentence, but add in punctuation?","completion":"\\"Trying to collect every piece of metal which he thinks would help for something in the future.\\""},{"prompt":"doors the dining area has a chill cave feel, outside has a nice little stream.

Instead of accepting this as a natural part of the ageing process, Donovan sought treatment to enhance his body. He underwent VASER treatment, a procedure that involves melting away unwanted fat and draining it. While the procedure cost £10,000, Donovan says he feels \\"so much happier\\" with his new body. Many people struggle with body image issues as they age. Donovan's decision to undergo VASER treatment is not an uncommon one. VASER is a popular cosmetic procedure that can help people achieve the body they want without going under the knife. It's a minimally invasive procedure that can remove unwanted fat deposits from the body. During the VASER procedure, a small incision is made, and a probe is inserted under the skin. The probe emits ultrasound energy, which causes the fat cells to vibrate and break apart. The fat is then suctioned out of the body using a cannula. Recovery time for VASER treatment is generally shorter than that of traditional liposuction, and patients can typically return to work within a few days. Donovan reportedly feels much happier with his new body and loves dancing with his shirt off in Ibiza. His experience is a powerful reminder that it's never too late to make a change and improve one's self-image. We should all feel comfortable and confident in our own bodies, and cosmetic procedures like VASER can help us achieve that goal. As with any medical procedure, it's important to do your research and speak with a qualified medical professional before undergoing treatment."},{"prompt":"Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Ranging from €2.80 to €6 per perso","completion":"Rangingfrom€2.80to€6perperson."},{"prompt":"the premise An old man sits on a terrace in the sun. true if An old man is sitting watching the sunset for the last time.?
