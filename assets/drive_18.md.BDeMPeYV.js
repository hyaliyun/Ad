One of the primary factors to consider is the purity of the platinum in the ring. Platinum jewelry should have a high level of purity, typically at least 95%, to ensure that it will last for years to come. To confirm the purity percentage of the platinum ring, you should check the hallmark on the inside of the band. The hallmark will typically show the purity percentage of the platinum and confirm that it is of high quality. If you do not see a hallmark, you should ask your jeweler about the purity of the platinum in the ring. Another important factor to consider when purchasing a platinum ring is the alloy used in the metal. Platinum is often alloyed with other metals to enhance its strength and durability. Some common alloys used in platinum rings include ruthenium, cobalt, and copper. These alloys can affect the color, durability, and price of the ring, so it is important to ask your jeweler about the specific alloy used in your ring. When it comes to the design of the ring, look for quality engraving and handcrafted filigree. High-quality engraving will give the ring a unique and personalized touch, while handcrafted filigree will add an intricate and elegant detail to the ring. In summary, to ensure you are getting a high-quality platinum ring, choose a ring with high purity, check the hallmark on the inside of the ring to confirm purity percentage, ask your jeweler about the alloy used in your platinum ring, look for quality engraving, and choose handcrafted filigree.

If the inductance is large enough, the energy will generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solidstate switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs.

Film called 'Illness' follows story of mentally ill boy called Benjamin. Ridgefield residents are furious and said Bucari is 'not welcome' Town leaders say they will not permit filming and said timing is 'poor' Bucari' appears to have removed Twitter feed and film page taken down.","completion":"Jonathan Bucari's plans to film his movie 'Illness' in Ridgefield, a town 20 miles away from the scene of the Sandy Hook shooting, have met with intense opposition from residents. The film tells the story of a young boy with mental illness named Benjamin. However, the townsfolk are vehemently against Bucari's project and have made it clear that he is 'not welcome' in Ridgefield. Leaders of the town have also refused to permit filming and cited the 'poor timing' of the project. The proposed location for the shoot is too close to the site of one of the deadliest school shootings in US history, and the community is understandably anxious about any potential disruptions that may occur. Bucari appears to have removed his Twitter feed and the film page has been taken down. The controversy surrounding Bucari's film highlights the sensitivities that surround the issue of gun violence in America. While it is critical to bring attention to mental health issues, creative projects, such as films, need to be handled with sensitivity and caution. The community's response to Bucari's film reveals the vast expanse of trauma that still lingers in the wake of such tragic events. It is important that any creative endeavors dealing with such significant events be approached with the utmost care and consideration for those directly affected. The decision to film 'Illness' near the scene of a mass shooting seems to be more than just poor timing for Ridgefield citizens, as it brings back memories of the fatal tragedy that they are still grappling with. Bucari's decision to withdraw the project, as evidenced by the removal of its online presence, is likely a wise one. In the future, filmmakers and artists alike must be mindful of the lasting effects and pain of such horrific and devastating events."},{"prompt":"Which word is used to describe any rock or soil material that has remained below zero degrees centigrade continuously for more than two years?","completion":"The word is \\"permafrost.\\""},{"prompt":"Complete the passage.

Use a steam cleaner. Steam it clean with your iron.","completion":"Maintaining the upholstery of chairs can be quite challenging, and steaming is a popular method to clean and refresh them. However, it is important to ensure that the steaming process does not cause any damage to the upholstery. A simple solution to this is to use a steam cleaner. A steam cleaner is specifically designed to clean surfaces using hot steam, which is a highly effective way to kill germs, bacteria, and remove dirt and stains. Unlike traditional irons, steam cleaners are equipped with specialized attachments that are suitable for different types of upholstery, ensuring that the cleaning process is gentle and non-damaging. To steam clean your upholstery, begin by testing a small, inconspicuous area to ensure that the steam does not cause any damage. Once you are satisfied that it is safe to proceed, fill the steamer with distilled water and switch it on. Next, select the appropriate attachment for the upholstery and start steaming. For best results, move the steamer slowly and methodically across the surface, ensuring that every inch of the upholstery is exposed to the steam. Work one section at a time, taking care to wipe away any excess moisture with a clean, dry cloth. If you do not have a steam cleaner, you can also steam your upholstery clean with your iron. Simply fill the water reservoir of your iron, set it to the steam setting and use the iron in the same manner as the steamer, being careful not to let the iron touch the upholstery as it can cause damage. In conclusion, maintaining the upholstery of your chairs is important to keep them looking new and fresh. Steaming is an effective method to clean and refresh upholstery without the use of harsh chemicals. By using a steam cleaner or your iron, you can ensure that your upholstery is well maintained without causing any damage."},{"prompt":"What is the answer to this question? who wrote we believe in god the father?","completion":"The author of \\"We Believe in God the Father\\" is unknown."},{"prompt":"Atari Games created a line of NES products under the name Tengen and took a different approach.

According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the UN, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010.

Tungsten filaments radiate mostly infrared radiation at temperatures where they remain solid – below 3,695 K (3,422 °C; 6,191 °F). Donald L. Klipstein explains it this way: An ideal thermal radiator produces visible light most efficiently at temperatures around 6,300 °C (6,600 K; 11,400 °F). Even at this high temperature, a lot of the radiation is either infrared or ultraviolet, and the theoretical luminous efficacy (LER) is 95 lumens per watt. No known material can be used as a filament at this ideal temperature, which is hotter than the sun's surface. An upper limit for incandescent lamp luminous efficacy (LER) is around 52 lumens per watt, the theoretical value emitted by tungsten at its melting point. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply unanswerable): What is not infrared or ultraviolet?","completion":"Visible light is not infrared or ultraviolet."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this summary: Place bowls of instant mashed potatoes in the rats' path. Make sure the rats have a source of water. Keep an eye out to make sure the flakes are being eaten.","completion":"Article: Dealing with rats in your home can be quite a nuisance, but did you know that instant mashed potatoes could actually help you combat this problem? By placing bowls of instant mashed potatoes in the rats' path, you can actually lure them away from other areas of your home and potentially catch them before they cause any damage. It's important to note that this method should be used in conjunction with other strategies to control the rat population, such as sealing up entry points and setting traps. However, placing bowls of instant mashed potatoes can be an effective and easy additional step. When using instant mashed potatoes as bait for rats, it's crucial that you also ensure they have access to a source of water. This is because rats need water to survive, and without it, they may become suspicious and avoid the mashed potato bait altogether. Additionally, keeping an eye out and checking the bowls of mashed potatoes periodically is important to make sure they are being eaten. So why do rats find instant mashed potatoes so appealing? The flakes have a strong aroma that is irresistible to many animals, and rats are no exception. By capitalizing on this, you may be able to keep rats away from other areas of your home while you work on more permanent solutions to your rat problem. Overall, while instant mashed potatoes may seem like an unusual solution to a rat problem, they can be a helpful tool in your fight against these pesky critters. Just remember to supplement the mashed potatoes with additional strategies to control the rat population, and to always be vigilant in your efforts to keep your home rodent-free."},{"prompt":"Write some highlights for the following article: (EW.com","completion":"I'm sorry, could you please provide the title of the article for me to give some highlights?"},{"prompt":"Summarize the following: Peel and dice a few potatoes so that you have about 2 cups.

Its thirtyone graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, i and y have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet. As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters q, w and x appear only in foreign words. The háček (ˇ) is used with certain letters to form new characters: š, ž, and č, as well as ň, ě, ř, ť, and ď (the latter five uncommon outside Czech).

Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides and is used in colored glasses.

The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than sodalime glass (108.5 vs 106.5 Ohm·cm, DC at 250 °C).

Not only does it show that you're willing to go the extra mile, but it also gives you the opportunity to make a connection with the company. Before you can send your note, you need to find the company's address. This can typically be found on the company's website or by doing a quick Google search. Make sure you have the correct address before sending your letter to avoid any delays or miscommunications. Now it's time to write your personal note. The key here is to be genuine and authentic. Start by thanking the employer for their time and consideration in reviewing your application. Mention specific aspects of the job or company that drew you in and explain why you believe you would be a good fit. It's also a good idea to include a sentence or two about yourself that didn't fit in your resume or cover letter. This could be a personal hobby or interest, or a relevant experience that showcases your skills. Finally, sign off with a polite closing and your contact information, including your phone number and email address. This makes it easy for the employer to get in touch with you if they have any follow-up questions or want to offer you an interview. Sending a personal note may seem like a small gesture, but it can make a big difference in your job search.

The report comprises several thousand pages and includes chilling pieces of evidence. One such piece shows a toddler sitting with rounds of ammunition over his little legs and a weapon propped up in the background. The report also reveals that some information has been redacted according to the law. The shooting left 20 children and six women dead at the school. The shooter, Adam Lanza, committed suicide with a handgun as police stormed the school. The release of the final report brings some closure to the families of the victims, but it also serves as a reminder of the tragedy that occurred. The Sandy Hook shooting was one of the worst mass shootings in US history and sparked a nationwide conversation about gun control. While the report sheds light on some of the details of the shooting, it also highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to mental health and gun control. Many have called for stricter gun laws in the wake of the tragedy, but others argue that mental health should be the focus of prevention efforts. Regardless of the approach taken, the Sandy Hook tragedy will continue to be a painful reminder of the need for action on issues of gun violence and mental health.

The only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960's. It hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter, which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust.

Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts.

Andre Hazout denies rape, but admits having sex with his clients. The obstetrician has admitted he may have fathered his clients' children.","completion":"Fertility Doctor Accused of Rape Amidst involvement with Sarkozy and Carla Bruni Clinic Andre Hazout, a French fertility doctor working at a clinic where former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni received treatment, has been accused of rape by one of his clients. While he denies the allegation, Hazout candidly admits to having sex with clients and has also admitted that he may have fathered some of his clients' children. With such serious allegations, it is essential to understand the nature of Hazout's work and the impact in the industry. Fertility treatments such as artificial insemination and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) are crucial options for couples struggling with infertility. However, medical practitioners are required to give their best to maintain professional standards and avoid any form of misconduct. The fact that Hazout admittedly had sexual relations with patients paints a blatantly unethical picture of the obstetrician. Just like any form of medical malpractice, clients should be able to trust their doctors and believe that their well-being is a top priority. There is no justification for abusing the trust of clients who are in desperate need of reproductive health services. Furthermore, Hazout's confession that he may have fathered children with his clients is equally concerning. It creates legal and ethical dilemmas that affect both the children and the mothers involved. Patients should have full control over their reproductive decisions, and medical professionals are responsible for upholding ethical and legal aspects of their practice. The healthcare industry is not immune to cases of misconduct, and the allegations against Hazout underline the significance of the doctor-patient relationship. Trusting a medical practitioner with your life and well-being is an enormous responsibility, and it is imperative that practitioners respect their patients and their needs. In conclusion, the accusations against Hazout are disturbing and unethical. His actions have violated the trust of his patients, and they must not be defended or excused. The healthcare industry must maintain high standards of professionalism and morality, and doctors found culpable of misconduct should be held accountable for their actions."},{"prompt":"Karen was a softball player.

McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.

One particular trend that emerged was the hashtag #IGotTheTalk, in which minorities shared experiences of being told how to behave with police. Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by officer Darren Wilson during an altercation in which Brown was said to have attempted to grab Wilson's gun. The incident was preceded by a convenience-store robbery, which authorities say Brown was involved in. The shooting of Michael Brown once again brought issues of police brutality and racial profiling to the forefront of public discourse, as well as highlighting the need for parents and communities to educate young people, particularly minorities, about how to interact with law enforcement in a way that is safe and respectful. The #IGotTheTalk trend on Twitter and other social media platforms provided a forum for people to share their personal stories of being schooled on how to act around police officers. While some criticized the trend as promoting a \\"victim mentality\\" or perpetuating stereotypes, many saw it as an important outlet for raising awareness about the realities of police interactions for people of color. In the wake of Michael Brown's death and the ensuing protests and discussions, there have been calls for increased police training on issues of racial bias and use of force, as well as greater accountability for officers who engage in abusive or discriminatory behavior.

It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste.

Keep the air circulating.","completion":"Proper tree and plant care is essential to maintain their health and beauty. Four key tasks to keep in mind are raking, pruning, watering, and air circulation. Raking is an important maintenance task that needs to be done regularly. Leaves, debris and dead plant parts on the ground create a perfect environment for pests and diseases to thrive. Raking helps prevent this by removing debris that accumulates under the tree or plant. It also allows light to penetrate to the lower canopy which in turn helps plants grow. Pruning the lower canopy of trees and plants is vital because it provides better access to the ground, allowing air to circulate freely. Pruning also keeps the plant or tree in shape, ensuring that it maintains an attractive look. As always, be careful when pruning and only use sharp and clean tools. Proper watering is essential to plant and tree health. Overwatering can lead to root rot, while under watering can cause the soil to dry out and the plant to wilt. You should water your plants and trees based on their specific needs, which can vary depending on factors such as the plant species, soil type, and weather conditions. Lastly, air circulation is crucial for tree and plant health. A well-ventilated environment allows air to move freely and keep pests and diseases from taking hold. Pruning and clearing away debris can help improve air circulation, but it's also necessary to plant trees and plants in strategic locations that allow for proper airflow. In summary, raking, pruning, watering, and air circulation are all key maintenance tasks when it comes to plant and tree health. By following these guidelines, you can keep your plants and trees thriving year-round.

By analyzing the data, policymakers can get a better understanding of how to allocate resources and develop programs to support different groups within the community. It should be noted that while families may be smaller in number than individuals, they are still a significant demographic. Families contribute to the social fabric of a community, provide support for one another, and play a key role in shaping the future generation. Understanding the needs and demographics of families can help policymakers develop initiatives that better support their well-being.

The officers were recently acquitted of any wrongdoing in Garner's death, which occurred after he was placed in a chokehold during an arrest in 2014. Perry argues that using Garner's health as a defense against the use of excessive force by the police is unacceptable. \\"One type of discrimination cannot be used to defend against another,\\" he said.

Perry's comments come amid ongoing protests against police violence and racism across the United States. Garner's death has become a symbol of these issues, and the failure to hold the officers involved accountable has fueled further anger and frustration.

To do this, you need to understand what a healthy terrapin looks like, take your terrapin for an annual wellness exam, and recognize signs of poor health. Firstly, it's important to understand what a healthy terrapin looks like. A healthy terrapin should have clear, bright eyes and a smooth, shiny shell. They should be active and alert, moving around freely and engaging with their environment. Their skin should be free from cuts or sores, and they should have a healthy appetite. To maintain your terrapin's good health, it's important to take them for an annual wellness exam. This can be done by a qualified veterinarian who will check your terrapin's overall health, examine their shell, and assess their diet and living conditions. This annual exam will help to identify any potential health problems early on, allowing you to take appropriate action to ensure the wellness of your pet. In addition to regular wellness exams, it's important to recognize the signs of poor health in your terrapin. Some signs to watch out for include: - Loss of appetite or eating habits - Changes in behavior or activity level - Abnormalities or discolourations on the skin or shell - Lethargy or a lack of energy - Breathing difficulties If you notice any of these signs, it's important to take your terrapin to a veterinarian as soon as possible for a proper diagnosis and treatment.

While both spellings are technically correct, there is a difference in usage depending on which form of English you are using. In American English, the spelling “gray” is the most commonly used, while in British English, “grey” is the preferred spelling. This difference in spelling is just one example of the many subtle variations between the two main branches of the English language. While they share a common ancestry, British and American English have evolved separately over the years, resulting in a number of differences in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. These variations can sometimes cause confusion, particularly when it comes to spelling, as the differences are often subtle and can be easily overlooked. However, it is important to pay attention to these differences, especially when writing for an international audience. Depending on where your intended readership is based, the spelling you choose could affect how your work is received. In some cases, using the “wrong” spelling could even be seen as a spelling mistake, which can harm your credibility as a writer. Ultimately, the choice between “gray” and “grey” comes down to where you are based and who your readers are.

It had been almost a year since he was first prescribed medical marijuana for PTSD. While the prescription was meant to help manage his symptoms, his bosses prohibited him from smoking while in uniform due to concerns about how it might be perceived by the public. Despite his protests that his employers didn't understand the importance of medical marijuana in treating PTSD, Corporal Francis was eventually forced to hand over his uniform. This caused him great emotional distress, as he had dedicated over two decades of his life to the force. As if this wasn't enough, Corporal Francis was later arrested for assaulting officers who were trying to help him secure treatment. Sadly, he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. This tragic story highlights the ongoing debate surrounding medical marijuana and its use by military personnel. While many argue that marijuana can be an effective treatment for PTSD and other conditions, veterans are often caught in the middle of conflicting policies and regulations. It's crucial that we take a compassionate approach to this issue, one that prioritizes the well-being of those who have served our country. This means listening to their experiences and their needs when it comes to medical treatment, and working together to find solutions that help them live healthy, fulfilling lives. As we remember Corporal Ronald Francis and honor his service to our country, let's also take this opportunity to reflect on how we can better support veterans and the unique challenges they face.

To begin, select a squash of your choice and wash it thoroughly. Then, using a sharp knife, cut the squash into small pieces that will fit into a microwave-safe dish.
