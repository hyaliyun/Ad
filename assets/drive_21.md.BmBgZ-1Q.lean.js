One crucial component of a formal outfit is thigh highs attached to a garter belt. To properly put on thigh highs, there are a few steps to follow. First, put the garter belt on around your waist and make sure it is in the right position. The belt should sit comfortably on your hips, and the suspender straps should hang down. Next, put on your pantyhose carefully, pulling them up until they meet the garter belt. Once your pantyhose are in place, it’s time to attach the garter clasps to your thigh highs. Starting at the back, clip each of the four clasps onto the top of the thigh highs, ensuring the straps lie flat against your thigh. It’s essential to take a moment to adjust the fit and the clasps after they are attached. Make sure the thigh highs are sitting correctly on your legs and that the garter belt feels secure. Finally, put on your underwear. By putting on your underwear last, you prevent any fabric from getting in the way while attaching the clasps. You also avoid any accidental exposure while adjusting the belt and clasps. In summary, to put on thigh highs correctly, put on the garter belt first, followed by the pantyhose. Attach the clasps to the thigh highs and adjust as needed. Lastly, put on your underwear.

To get started, gather all the necessary supplies. This will include bleach, a brush, a flat surface, cardboard, white chalk, and of course, a shirt to be customized. Once you have all your supplies, begin by sketching out your design on the shirt using the white chalk. This will act as a guide for when you begin applying the bleach. Make sure the shirt is on a flat surface to ensure accuracy. With your design sketched out, fold the sides of the shirt under the cardboard to protect the back from getting bleach on it. Now it's time to prepare the bleach. It's important to follow the instructions on the bleach bottle carefully and wear gloves to protect your hands. Once the bleach is ready, dip your brush into it and begin tracing the chalk lines of your design. Use steady strokes to ensure that the bleach is applied evenly to the shirt. Take your time to ensure the lines are neat and clean. Once you've finished tracing your design, let the shirt sit in the sun for at least an hour. Sunlight will help activate the bleach and create the desired effect. Make sure to keep an eye on the shirt to ensure it doesn't get over-bleached. After an hour, rinse the shirt thoroughly, and then hand wash it. Bleach can be harsh on fabrics, so make sure to hand wash the shirt rather than using a washing machine. Once it's all washed, let it dry naturally. Using bleach to customize a shirt is a fun and creative way to express individuality.

Public religious ritual had to be enacted by specialists and professionals faultlessly; a mistake might require that the action, or even the entire festival, be repeated from the start. The historian Livy reports an occasion when the presiding magistrate at the Latin festival forgot to include the Roman people among the list of beneficiaries in his prayer; the festival had to be started over.

Law enforcement in France and elsewhere in Europe are now hunting for him.","completion":"France's justice officials have spoken out about a pressing problem with the country's prison system: overpopulation. This issue has come to the forefront following the dramatic escape of notorious criminal Redoine Faid. Faid first made headlines in the 1990s for his brazen attacks on armored trucks. Once caught, he was sentenced to a lengthy prison term. However, Faid wasn't content to spend his days behind bars. Earlier this year, he held guards at gunpoint and used explosives to burst through the doors of a prison in northern France. This wasn't his first escape attempt, but it was by far his most audacious. Law enforcement officials throughout Europe are now on the hunt for Faid. The escape artist seems to have vanished, and authorities are concerned that he could strike again at any time. The escape has sparked serious concerns about France's prison overcrowding. With so many inmates locked up together, it can be difficult for guards to maintain control. This has led to a rise in prison violence and concerns about inmates becoming radicalized. In some cases, criminals are able to take advantage of the crowded conditions to facilitate their escape, as Faid did. It's not clear what the solution to France's prison overcrowding problem might be. However, it's clear that something needs to be done to prevent other dangerous criminals from following in Faid's footsteps. The hunt for the escapee is still ongoing, but hopefully, officials will be able to catch him soon and prevent him from doing any further harm."},{"prompt":"ere is a premise: A woman with a colorful skirt walking along a path.

First and foremost, it is important to choose the medium that works best for you. This might mean keeping a physical notebook, using a digital tool like a spreadsheet or task manager, or even using a combination of different methods. Once you have selected your medium, the next step is to write down every idea that comes to mind. This might include both big, overarching goals as well as smaller, more manageable ones. The key is to brainstorm without filtering or editing yourself, allowing all ideas to flow freely. Once you have a comprehensive list of goals, it is time to review and refine them. One important step in this process is to include a combination of large and small goals. Having a mix of both can help you feel accomplished as you make progress, while also keeping you focused on your bigger picture objectives. Finally, it is important to take some time to think before you begin editing your list. Resist the urge to immediately cut out any goals that seem daunting or impractical. Instead, give yourself some space to reflect on what you really want to achieve, and which goals will truly help you get there. By following these steps, you can create a roadmap for achieving your goals that is both comprehensive and manageable.

New Barca coach Luis Enrique is said to be a keen admirer of Aguero's talent, as well as his impressive record on the field. The 25-year-old scored an impressive 28 goals in 34 games for Manchester City last season, proving his worth as one of the most outstanding forwards in the game.

The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebeians; Juliet/Lavinia wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway's version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years.

These versions also eliminated elements deemed inappropriate at the time. For example, Garrick's version transferred all language describing Rosaline to Juliet, to heighten the idea of faithfulness and downplay the loveatfirstsight theme.

This table has been both surprising and interesting, as it shows a variety of changes in the league positions from the current standings. Firstly, if only goals scored by English players were counted, Arsenal would lead the Premier League. This would be due to the contributions of Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere. Interestingly though, all their wins would have been by just 1-0, which shows a lack of contribution from other players. The top four teams in the Premier League would be vastly different if only English players' goals were counted. Swansea City, Liverpool and West Brom would occupy the second, third and fourth positions respectively. Most football fans would be surprised to see such a shift in rankings, as these teams are not favourites to finish in the top four this season. On the other hand, Manchester United, a team that dominates the Premier League with their star players, would be sitting in mid-table. Only Wayne Rooney would be contributing to their goal tally, which shows a lack of diversity in scoring. What is perhaps most shocking in this table is the position of the current Premier League leaders, Chelsea. If only goals scored by English players were counted, they would find themselves in relegation places. This shows how heavily Chelsea rely on international players for their success. Overall, this table provides an interesting insight into how the Premier League would look if only English players' goals were counted. It also shows that English players can hold their own within the league and contribute to their team's success."},{"prompt":"What is the subject line for this email? Hey Mat! How are ya?

This number was arrived at by counting every person living in the United States as of April 1, 2010, including citizens, non-citizen legal residents, and non-citizen long-term visitors. When it comes to households, the census found that there were approximately 116.7 million occupied housing units in the United States in 2010.

Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.

As with any pet, proper care and attention are crucial to their health and well-being. When it comes to breeding cichlids, there are several steps you can take to ensure success. Firstly, ensure you have both males and females of the species you wish to breed. Next, be sure to feed them an appropriate amount of food. Overfeeding can lead to health issues and even death, so moderation is key. Any health issues that arise should be treated promptly. Be on the lookout for any signs of illness, such as strange behavior or physical abnormalities, and take action as soon as possible. When your cichlids are ready to breed, they will become more active and aggressive. Females may lay eggs on flat surfaces, so be sure to provide appropriately sized and placed substrate for spawning. At this point, it’s crucial to monitor the cichlids for attraction and breeding behavior. The male may display bright colors and enlarge his finnage to attract the female. Once mating occurs, the male will fertilize the eggs and both parents will tend to them. If you notice that the breeding process isn’t progressing as expected, you may need to step in and provide some assistance. This could involve removing any eggs or fry that are in danger or adding supplements to the water to encourage spawning. The final step is simply to observe the breeding process and ensure that the eggs are properly cared for until they hatch.

Then it may be said that the coil has lengthened the antenna to achieve an electrical length of 2.5 meters. However, the resulting resistive impedance achieved will be quite a bit lower than the impedance of a resonant monopole, likely requiring further impedance matching. In addition to a lower radiation resistance, the reactance becomes higher as the antenna size is reduced, and the resonant circuit formed by the antenna and the tuning coil has a Q factor that rises and eventually causes the bandwidth of the antenna to be inadequate for the signal being transmitted. This is the major factor that sets the size of antennas at 1 MHz and lower frequencies.

Is there: Check out a conflict style indicator and or a personality style indicator.","completion":"Effective communication is crucial for the success of any workplace. It facilitates efficient accomplishment of tasks, fosters a positive work environment, and improves employee satisfaction. However, communication breakdowns can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and decrease productivity. To ensure that communication in the workplace is effective, organizations can use tools such as conflict style indicators or personality style indicators. A conflict style indicator identifies the preferred style of an individual in conflict situations. These indicators typically outline five styles, namely accommodating, avoiding, collaborating, competing, and compromising. Accommodating individuals prioritize the needs of others over their own, and seek to find common ground. Avoiding individuals tend to withdraw from conflict situations to avoid confrontation. Collaborating individuals seek win-win solutions that benefit all parties involved. Competing individuals prioritize their own needs over others and seek to win the conflict. Compromising individuals try to find solutions that partially satisfy the needs of all parties. Personality style indicators help to identify an individual's personality traits, their strengths, and weaknesses. They provide insights into how an individual communicates, interacts, and approaches work-related situations. The commonly used personality style indicator is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which categorizes individuals based on their preferences on four dimensions: Extraversion vs Introversion, Sensing vs Intuition, Thinking vs Feeling, and Judging vs Perceiving. Using these tools can help individuals and teams understand their communication styles better, as well as identify areas for improvement. For example, if a team member prefers an accommodating conflict style, they may need to practice communicating their own needs more assertively. Similarly, if a team member tends to avoid conflicts, they may need to learn how to communicate their thoughts and feelings more effectively. In conclusion, communication breakdowns can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and decreased productivity. To ensure effective communication in the workplace, organizations can use conflict style indicators or personality style indicators to identify individual communication styles and improve them where necessary. This approach will foster a positive work environment, improve employee satisfaction, and ultimately benefit the organization's success."},{"prompt":"Can we conclude that Bill was hungry. if the statement Bill passed the halfempty plate to John because he was hungry. is true?

Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the liquid pig iron to create steel. Puddling was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In 1858, Sir Henry Bessemer developed a process of steelmaking by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow. Mangalloy, an alloy of steel and manganese exhibiting extreme hardness and toughness, was one of the first alloy steels, and was created by Robert Hadfield in 1882.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The UK Government's decision to appoint Lynne Featherstone as the Equalities Minister has sparked controversy after she made a move that contradicts the recommendations of the government's own equality quango. Featherstone's decision has put the Government at odds with the quango, which was set up to provide guidance on equality-related issues. Featherstone's move is centered around the issue of transgender rights. The Minister has announced plans to make it easier for transgender individuals to change their legal gender, including by removing the requirement for medical procedures such as gender reassignment surgery. This move has been criticized by some as a departure from the recommendations of the government's own equality quango, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The EHRC has previously recommended that the process for legal gender recognition should include medical procedures, arguing that this provides a safeguard against people who might fraudulently claim to be transgender. Featherstone's move, however, has been welcomed by transgender rights advocates, who argue that the current process is overly intrusive and medicalized. The decision has raised concerns about the government's commitment to its own equality agenda. Critics have accused Featherstone of disregarding the EHRC's recommendations and undermining the work of the quango, which was established to provide independent guidance on equality-related issues. Featherstone, however, has defended her position, arguing that the government has a duty to protect the rights of transgender individuals, who often face discrimination and harassment. She has also emphasized the importance of allowing individuals to define their own gender, rather than being subject to medical diagnosis. The controversy highlights the complex nature of navigating issues related to equality and human rights. While the government has established the EHRC to provide guidance on these issues, it is ultimately responsible for making policy decisions that balance competing interests and conflicting perspectives. Whether Featherstone's move represents a positive step forward for transgender rights, or a departure from the government's own equality agenda, remains a matter of debate."},{"prompt":"Goal: To clean the lens of your camera, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?

The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later.

He says international aid could repair Gaza's economy, and Israel could ease blockade.","completion":"Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the United States, believes that the ongoing crisis in the Middle East presents a unique opportunity for creative diplomacy. In his opinion, the model solution should be the successful removal of chemical weapons from Syria, which shows that peace can be achieved through international cooperation. The Middle East has been plagued by conflict and instability for decades, but Oren believes there is hope for a peaceful resolution to the region's problems. One key element to this resolution is the removal of Hamas rocket stockpiles from Gaza. Oren suggests that United States inspectors could oversee this process, ensuring that the rockets are safely removed and the threat of future attacks is eliminated. In addition to this, Oren believes that international aid could play a crucial role in repairing Gaza's economy, which has been decimated by years of conflict. By providing financial assistance and investment, the international community could help to rebuild the region and create new opportunities for its residents. Finally, Oren suggests that Israel could ease the blockade on Gaza, allowing for the free flow of goods and services. This would not only help to stimulate the region's economy, but also help to build trust and cooperation between Israel and Palestine. In conclusion, Michael Oren's ideas for a peaceful resolution of the Middle East crisis offer a model for effective and creative diplomacy.

However, the wrong undergarments can ruin your mood and make you feel uncomfortable. To help you choose the right undergarments for support and comfort, consider the following tips. First and foremost, it is crucial to wear undergarments that fit. Undergarments that are too tight or too loose can make you feel uncomfortable and cause chafing or irritation. Therefore, choose undergarments that are your correct size and make you feel comfortable. Secondly, avoid undergarments that offer no support. Supportive undergarments help to hold everything in place and prevent sagging. On the other hand, unsupported undergarments can cause discomfort and ruin the look of any outfit. You may also want to try body-slimming undergarments. These undergarments are designed to give you a smoother, slimmer appearance by cinching and shaping the body. They can help you avoid panty lines and give you a little extra confidence with your outfit. Lastly, consider wearing nylon stockings with a \\"control top\\". These stockings provide additional support to help keep everything in place while also smoothing out any bumps or bulges. Plus, they provide an extra layer of warmth during cooler months. In summary, wearing the right undergarments can make a big difference in how comfortable and confident you feel. Therefore, choose undergarments that fit, offer support, consider body-slimming options and try nylon stockings with a “control top” to give you the support and comfort you need."},{"prompt":"Question: How many tourist visas were granted in 2003?

Dozens of Native Americans have died serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. Geronimo was an Apache leader in the late 1800s. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Native American officials and activists are speaking out against the use of Geronimo's name in connection with Osama bin Laden's death, arguing that it undermines the military service of Native people. Geronimo was an Apache leader in the late 1800s, and dozens of Native Americans have died serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. To link Geronimo with bin Laden is to perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Native people as savage and violent, say critics. The controversy began when it was revealed that \\"Geronimo\\" was the code name used for bin Laden in the military operation that killed him. This prompted immediate backlash from members of the Native American community, who see the use of Geronimo's name as an insult. According to Harlyn Geronimo, the great-grandson of the Apache leader, \\"We are very saddened as Native peoples to be used in this way, when one of our own is used to describe one of the most hated enemies of the United States.\\" Native American leaders have also pointed out that the use of Geronimo's name is not just offensive, but historically inaccurate. Geronimo was a warrior who fought to defend his homeland against invaders, whereas Bin Laden was a terrorist who targeted innocent civilians. To tie Geronimo to Bin Laden is to erase the contributions that Native Americans have made to the US military over the years, say activists. As noted by Deb Haaland, a Native woman who is now the Secretary of the Interior, \\"Native Americans have served in the military at the highest rate of any demographic group. We have sacrificed so much for our country and our people. Using the name of a Native American hero to describe a terrorist is just wrong.\\" In conclusion, the use of Geronimo's name in connection with bin Laden's death has sparked outcry from Native American activists, who argue that it erases the contributions of Native people to the military and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. Moving forward, it is important that we honor the sacrifices of Native Americans who have served in the military by using their names with respect and accuracy."},{"prompt":"ere are some concepts: cause, close, pier What is a sentence about these concepts?","completion":"The cause of the accident was a close encounter with a pier."},{"prompt":"This is some data: The Rice Boat eatType restaurant; The Rice Boat priceRange less than £20; The Rice Boat customer rating low; The Rice Boat area city centre; The Rice Boat familyFriendly no; The Rice Boat near Express by Holiday Inn.

He says Obama's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake.","completion":"Renowned political commentator, David Gergen, believes that President Obama's State of the Union address could be a critical turning point for his second term. Gergen cautions that failure to bring the Republican Party to the negotiating table could result in a high-stakes budget fight that the country cannot afford. Gergen further argues that it would be an error for Democrats to adopt an uncompromising stance and assume they can win solely by refusing to negotiate. This approach could have dire consequences for the country in the long run as it risks exacerbating partisan division and gridlock in Washington. Moreover, Gergen opines that Obama's recent shift towards a more partisan approach is a big mistake. It sends the wrong message to Americans who are increasingly disillusioned with politics as usual, and this strategy will only serve to alienate further an already divided country. In conclusion, David Gergen's insights highlight the importance of President Obama's State of the Union address. It is an opportunity for the president to set the tone and chart a path for his second term.

The baby was found dead in the back of the car by her older brother who spotted her on the way back from school. This horrific incident highlights the dangers of leaving children unattended in a car, especially in high temperatures. Leaving a child in a car can have devastating consequences. Heatstroke is the leading cause of child vehicular deaths, and it can occur even on a mild day. The temperature inside a car can rise rapidly, even with the windows slightly open. This can lead to dehydration, heatstroke, and death. It is crucial for parents and other caregivers to be aware of their surroundings and never leave a child unattended in a vehicle. In this case, James Hollingsworth, the grandfather of Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth, was the responsible party. As a result of his forgetfulness, he will now face criminal charges. This serves as a reminder that there are legal consequences for leaving a child unattended in a car. However, more important than avoiding criminal charges is preventing such tragedies from happening in the first place. It is the responsibility of adults to keep children safe. Those responsible for the care of children must develop strategies to ensure that no child is left unattended in a car. Parents, caregivers, and family members can take simple steps like placing a diaper bag or a purse in the backseat next to the child as a reminder. In conclusion, the death of Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth is a tragic reminder of the importance of being vigilant when it comes to the safety of children.
