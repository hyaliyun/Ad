To achieve the best results possible, it’s important to trim the top of your hair in sections. This will allow you to work on one area at a time and ensure precision in each cut.

After seeking legal advice, it is important to compare the original agreement or contract to the work that has been completed to ensure that both parties are on the same page.

Make sure to smooth out any bubbles or wrinkles in the paper to ensure it adheres properly. After the picture is in place, allow it to dry. Once the picture is dry, use a damp cloth to soak the back of the paper. Rub the paper off of the wood gently to reveal the picture.

The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn't able to excite, really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that I thought was gruesome but even that didn't redeem it. I did get to like the character of Kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not actually needed for this film and I think the director/writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose, if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on Kate's part, it may have worked Jeremy's acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it.

'No matter what you fine me, I cannot pay the BBC or anyone connected with it' Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Leisha Brookes, a woman who claims to have been abused by Jimmy Savile, has spoken out about her traumatic experience. Brookes alleges that she was introduced to Savile by a cameraman friend of her family when she was just nine years old. She says that Savile then subjected her to horrific abuse. Brookes' testimony is just one of many that has come out in recent years regarding Savile's predatory behavior. The former BBC star has been accused of abusing hundreds of young people over the course of several decades. Despite the mounting evidence against Savile, he was never brought to justice. He passed away in 2011, just a year before allegations of his sexual abuse began to surface. In the years since, many of his victims have spoken out, demanding justice for the crimes that were committed against them. For Brookes, justice may never truly be served. In a statement, she declared that she could never afford to compensate the BBC or anyone else connected with Savile's abuse. But by coming forward and sharing her story, she hopes to help prevent similar abuses from happening in the future. The case of Jimmy Savile is a troubling reminder of the power dynamics at play in cases of sexual abuse. Victims are often silenced by fear and shame, while abusers are able to operate with impunity due to their positions of authority. It is up to all of us to break this cycle by speaking out and demanding justice for those who have been victimized."},{"prompt":"Solve 1550*a 1998*a = 273196 for a.

Keep in mind that I am by no means an expert in beer, but the whole flight was not very good overall, too bitter in my opinion, and the 'carrot cake' Heff tasted very basic without a hint of the carrot cake that I was expecting.

As the American Revolution approached, General David Wooster and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain could be resolved short of rebellion. On 23 April 1775, which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day, the Second Company, Governor's Foot Guard, of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British parliament. Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a threeday march to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge.

On average, a professional football field measures 100 yards, endzone to endzone. Therefore, a touchdown is usually credited with 100 yards, even though the actual gain is usually much shorter. In the case of the two longest scoring touchdowns of a game, the yardage accumulated is usually significant. However, the answer to this question varies from game to game, depending on the teams, players, and strategies employed. To determine the yardage accumulated on the two longest scoring touchdowns of a game, one usually needs to review the game's statistics or watch a recap or highlight of the game. The statistics will usually include the length of each touchdown pass or run, which can be used to calculate the total yardage. For example, in a recent NFL game, the two longest scoring touchdowns were a 60-yard pass and a 75-yard run. Therefore, the total yardage accumulated on the two longest scoring touchdowns of the game was 135 yards. In summary, the yardage accumulated on the two longest scoring touchdowns of a game is an important statistic for anyone interested in football. It reflects the teams and players' performance, and it can provide valuable insights into the game's strategy and outcome."},{"prompt":"What is the answer to this question? how many episodes are there in moon lovers?","completion":"There are 20 episodes in Moon Lovers."},{"prompt":"w do you do this: To allow the cookie butter to soften to eat after storing OPTIONS: You can let it sit out at room temp for 30 minutes prior to eating You can let it sit in the freezer for 30 minutes prior to eating","completion":"To allow cookie butter to soften for eating after storing, you can let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes or in the freezer for 30 minutes."},{"prompt":"1.

Pin the casing just below the waistline you marked on the dress.","completion":"When making a dress, it's important to create a smooth and comfortable waistline. One way to achieve this is by adding a waist casing. Here's how you can do it: First, cut a strip of fabric that's 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than the circumference of your waistline. The width of the strip can vary depending on your preference, but typically it's around 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Next, mark the waistline on your dress with a removable fabric marker or chalk. The waist casing should be pinned just below this line. Make sure the casing is centered and straight before pinning. Once the casing is pinned in place, sew it onto the dress using a straight stitch. You can use a sewing machine or hand stitch it. Be careful not to sew over the pins, and remove them as you go. After the casing is securely sewn, you can insert elastic or a drawstring into it to cinch the waistline. Alternatively, you can leave the casing empty and use a belt to define the waist. Adding a waist casing can give your dress a more polished look and provide a comfortable fit. With these simple steps, you can easily create a waist casing on your own."},{"prompt":"Premise: Revealed Clinton family troubles immediately after his pastoral visit.

Young Muslims embrace a call to arms for a war of cultures, he adds. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The period between 1914-1945 was said to be a modern version of the Thirty Years War, which gave way to a four-decade-long Cold War, according to Frank Furedi. The origins of the \\"Culture Wars\\" can be traced back to around August 1914. Young Muslims today are embracing a call to arms for a war of cultures. The comparison drawn between the Thirty Years War and the period between 1914-1945 is not unwarranted. The Thirty Years War was a devastating conflict that ravaged Europe between 1618-1648. Similarly, the period between 1914-1945 was characterized by the two World Wars, which saw countless deaths and destruction on an unprecedented scale. This second Thirty Years War gave way to the Cold War, a geopolitical conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, which lasted from 1947-1991. The Cold War was marked by a tense arms race, propaganda battles, and intense political rivalry. It was a period of great instability, as the world was divided into two opposing blocs, each vying for global dominance. The origins of the \\"Culture Wars\\" as we know them today can be situated around August 1914, according to Frank Furedi. This was the time when many intellectuals began to question the moral and cultural foundations of Western civilization. The horrors of the First World War led many to question the values and beliefs that had underpinned Western society for centuries. Today, we see young Muslims embracing a call to arms for a war of cultures. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the proliferation of extremist groups such as ISIS can be seen as a response to perceived Western cultural imperialism. Young Muslims are rejecting the values and beliefs of the West and instead embracing a more traditional, conservative interpretation of Islam. In conclusion, the period between 1914-1945 was a time of great upheaval and conflict, which gave way to the Cold War and the \\"Culture Wars.\\" The rise of Islamic fundamentalism can be seen as a response to perceived Western cultural imperialism, and it remains to be seen how this conflict will play out in the years to come."},{"prompt":"Select the topic that this about: BERLIN, Germany Brazilianborn striker Kevin Kuranyi scored the equalizer to earn Germany a 11 draw with Brazil in a friendly in Berlin, that was a rematch of their 2002 World Cup final.

If you're a beginner, it's better to start with a student violin, which is designed to be affordable and easy to play. As you become more skilled, you may want to upgrade to an intermediate violin, which offers better quality and sound. Advanced violinists, on the other hand, require a professional-grade instrument to really showcase their skills. These violins are made of high-quality materials and are designed for optimal sound production. Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced violinist, it's important to choose an instrument that suits your needs and skill level. Another factor to consider is the style of music you want to play. Acoustic violins are great for classical and folk music, but if you're interested in playing rock or jazz, an electric violin may be a better option. Electric violins have a sharper, more modern sound that can be amplified, making them ideal for playing in live performances or recording studios. If you're not sure which violin is right for you, it's worth considering a rent-to-buy program. These programs allow you to rent a violin for a set period of time and then purchase it outright if you're happy with the instrument. This can be a great way to try out different types of violins and find the one that best suits your needs. In conclusion, when buying a violin, it's important to think about your skill level, the style of music you want to play, and whether or not a rent-to-buy program might be a good option. With these factors in mind, you can make an informed decision and find the perfect violin to help you achieve your musical goals."},{"prompt":"Problem: Solve 343*t = 336*t 21 for t.

Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an overlayer of yellow pigment.

Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields.

The incident, which took place in a forest reserve, highlights the brutal nature of animal conflicts in the wild. Reports suggest that the brawl between the bull and cow was caused by a territorial dispute or a competition for resources such as food or water. Although such conflicts are not uncommon in the animal kingdom, it is a rare sight for humans to witness them firsthand. The incident also sheds light on the intensity of fights between animals. Elephants, for example, are known to engage in violent conflicts. However, what is interesting is that fights between male and female elephants are comparatively rare. This could be because male elephants are more focussed on competing with other males for mating rights. It is worth noting that while watching animals fight each other may be fascinating, it is crucial to remember that these are wild animals and must be treated with caution and respect. The savage jungle brawl in Assam serves as a reminder that as humans, we must not interfere in the natural course of things in the animal kingdom, but instead ensure that we protect their habitats and ensure their conservation."},{"prompt":"John Robert Gamble (born 1948) is a former professional baseball shortstop.

This type of symbiosis is relatively uncommon in rudimentary reference texts, but is omnipresent in the natural world.[citation needed] There are two types of amensalism, competition and antibiosis. Competition is where a larger or stronger organisms deprives a smaller or weaker one from a resource. Antibiosis occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion. An example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree. The mature tree can begin to rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and, if the mature tree is very large, it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients. Throughout the process the mature tree is unaffected. Indeed, if the sapling dies, the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling. Note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling's decomposition, rather than from the living sapling, which would be a case of parasitism.[citation needed] An example of antibiosis is Juglans nigra (black walnut), secreting juglone, a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone.","completion":"The title of this article is \\"Amensalism: A Type of Symbiosis Where One Organism is Inhibited or Destroyed While the Other is Unaffected\\"."},{"prompt":"Table5.1.CalculatedtotalNloss,NH3emissionsandNaccessibleforpercolationinDenmarkatdifferenthallarrangementsseeninanoverallperspective(hall,warehouse,field),tons1999.Nlosstotal,tonsNH3,tonsNaccessibleforpercolation,tonsA.Hallwithtroughsandweeklycleanout6,2563,2292,755B.Hallwithtroughsanddailyautomaticcleanout5,7502,3782,949C.Hallwithouttroughsandwithweeklycleanout(20%percolationinhallassumed)7,5133,7363,113C3.

Subsequent administrative costcutting triggered the start of a longterm population decline whereby those who could afford to do so tended to leave the island for better opportunities elsewhere. The latter half of the 19th century saw the advent of steam ships not reliant on trade winds, as well as the diversion of Far East trade away from the traditional South Atlantic shipping lanes to a route via the Red Sea (which, prior to the building of the Suez Canal, involved a short overland section). These factors contributed to a decline in the number of ships calling at the island from 1,100 in 1855 to only 288 in 1889. By 1889 how many ships were going to the island?

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Although it can be found in most grocery stores, some people may not have access to it or prefer to make their own. This is where substitute buttermilk comes in handy. Substitute buttermilk can be made by adding an acid, usually vinegar or lemon juice, to regular milk. The acid reacts with the milk, curdling it and producing a similar tangy taste to buttermilk. This substitute can be used in any recipe that calls for buttermilk, such as pancakes, biscuits, and fried chicken. However, if you are interested in the traditional process of making buttermilk, it involves churning cream until it separates into butter and buttermilk. The creamy, tangy buttermilk that remains after the butter is removed is the real deal. This homemade buttermilk can be used in the same way as the substitute version, but the taste and texture may differ slightly. To make buttermilk at home, simply pour a quart of heavy cream into a stand mixer and let it churn until it separates. You can also use a jar and shake the cream vigorously. Once the butter separates from the buttermilk, strain the liquid through a cheesecloth to remove any leftover butter pieces. Your homemade buttermilk is now ready to use. In conclusion, substitute buttermilk is a great option for those who can’t access or don’t want to make real buttermilk. It can be made easily by adding an acid to regular milk and can be used in the same way as real buttermilk. However, if you’re interested in the traditional method of making buttermilk and want to experience its unique taste and texture, you can easily make it at home using heavy cream."},{"prompt":"Generate a short movie review that has positive sentiment.","completion":"This movie is fantastic!

Long has now scored four goals in his last four games, cementing his position as a vital asset for Ronald Koeman's team. Speaking after the match, Koeman praised his team's performance and indicated that the title challenge was still on. \\"Nothing is impossible,\\" Koeman said. \\"We have shown that we can compete with the best teams in the league, and we will continue to fight for every point.\\" Southampton has been the surprise package of the Premier League this season, with many predicting them to struggle following the summer sale of several key players.

Their next match is a crucial encounter with third-place Manchester City, who are currently four points behind Southampton in the table.

Consumers are advised to thoroughly wash their hands after handling raw chicken and to ensure that it is cooked to an internal temperature of 75°C to kill any bacteria. The FSA also advises against washing raw chicken before cooking, as this can spread the bacteria onto surfaces and cause cross-contamination. Instead, it is recommended that chicken be cooked straight from the packaging. Campylobacter infection can cause symptoms such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and fever, and in severe cases, it can lead to long-term health complications. Therefore, it is essential to handle raw chicken with care and cook it thoroughly. In addition, the FSA is working closely with the poultry industry to reduce the level of campylobacter in chicken production. Measures such as improving hygiene on farms and better packaging are being implemented to reduce the risk of contamination. In conclusion, the latest report from the FSA highlights the need for consumers to be vigilant when handling raw chicken and to ensure that it is cooked properly. By following these guidelines, consumers can reduce their risk of contracting foodborne illness and contribute to the reduction of campylobacter in chicken production."},{"prompt":"Answer a question about this article: The storage in sensory memory and shortterm memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, longterm memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span). Its capacity is immeasurable. For example, given a random sevendigit number we may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in our shortterm memory. On the other hand, we can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in longterm memory.

Camouflage the lace on the wig with concealer. Use heat styling tools only on human hair wigs. Style the wig in an updo, if desired.","completion":"Wigs can be a great way to change your look or add some flair to your style. However, to make your wig look as natural as possible, it's important to follow a few tips. One common issue with wigs is the visibility of knots or lace, which can detract from the overall look. One solution is to bleach the knots or lace to make them less noticeable. Another trick to hide the lace is to use concealer. Find a concealer that matches your skin tone and apply a thin layer over the lace. This will help to blend the wig with your natural skin and make it look more realistic. When it comes to styling your wig, it's important to be mindful of the type of wig you have. If you're working with a human hair wig, you can use heat styling tools to create the look you want. However, synthetic wigs cannot withstand high heat, so it's important to stick to other styling methods. If you're interested in an updo, this is also possible with a wig. To create an updo, start by putting your hair in a ponytail. Next, pin the wig to your head over the ponytail, being careful not to damage the wig. Then, take sections of the wig and pin them into the ponytail to create your desired updo.

Fill a graduated cylinder halfway full with water. Read the starting water level in the cylinder. Drop the gold into the vial and record the new water level. Subtract the measurements to find the difference in the water level. Divide the gold’s weight by the difference in the water level.","completion":"Article: If you've ever had a piece of gold and wondered how much it weighs, you might have found that it's not as simple as placing it on a scale. However, there is a method that's fairly easy and accurate that you can use to determine the weight of your gold. In this article, we will guide you through the process step-by-step. First, get yourself a reliable and accurate scale. You can find them at most jewelry or hardware stores. Place your piece of gold on the scale and take note of the measurement. Keep in mind that the unit of measurement should be either grams or ounces, depending on your preference. Next, get a graduated cylinder and fill it halfway with water. Be sure to keep the cylinder on a flat surface to ensure accurate readings. Record the starting water level on the cylinder. Then, carefully drop your piece of gold into the cylinder, making sure it's fully submerged in the water. The gold will displace some of the water, causing the water level to rise. Read the new water level in the cylinder and record it. To find out the difference in the water level, subtract the starting water level from the new water level. This will give you an accurate measurement of how much water was displaced by the gold. Finally, divide the weight of your gold by the difference in the water level. This will give you an accurate measurement of your gold's density, which will help you calculate its weight. For example, if your gold weighed 10 grams and the difference in the water level was 5 milliliters, then your gold has a density of 2 grams per milliliter. Therefore, its weight is 5 grams. In conclusion, determining the weight of your gold using a scale and a graduated cylinder is a simple and accurate process. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can confidently determine the weight of your gold with ease and accuracy."},{"prompt":"One of them said they were not from around there and had no idea .

First and foremost, it's important to wash your legs thoroughly, removing any dirt or sweat that may have accumulated throughout the day. This not only helps to keep your legs clean, but it also provides a fresh canvas for the next step: exfoliation. Exfoliating your legs is vital for removing dead skin cells and promoting skin cell turnover. There are many ways to exfoliate your legs, from using a loofah or body scrub to dry body brushing. Whichever method you choose, be sure to use gentle circular motions and avoid any areas with cuts or abrasions. After exfoliating, it's time to shave your legs. Whether you prefer a razor, electric shaver, or waxing, make sure you are using a high-quality product and following the instructions carefully. Shaving can be a little tough on your skin, so be sure to hold off on any further exfoliation or application of lotions or oils until after you've finished shaving. Once you've finished shaving, gently pat your legs dry with a towel, being careful not to rub too harshly. While it's important to remove excess moisture, your skin should still be slightly damp before moving on to the next step. This allows any subsequent products you apply to absorb more easily into the skin. Overall, washing, exfoliating, and shaving your legs is a great way to promote healthy skin and achieve a smooth, polished look. By following these simple steps and choosing quality products, you'll be well on your way to achieving legs that feel as great as they look."},{"prompt":"Write a brief sentence.","completion":"Sure thing, what should I write a brief sentence about?"},{"prompt":"Nicole tried it but no one else was even brave enough to give it a try .

He created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants. These monopolies included salt, iron, and liquor production, as well as bronzecoin currency. The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty. The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court. The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d. 68 BC).

Seek professional medical care if you have a more severe virus.","completion":"When we experience pain, fever or other symptoms during a regular viral infection, taking over-the-counter drugs can be a useful option. These medications can help to alleviate discomfort and assist in managing symptoms. However, it's essential to choose the right type of medication for your specific symptoms. For instance, for nasal congestion caused by the virus, nasal sprays can provide relief. They work by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion. It's important to note that nasal sprays should not be used for more than three days as they can cause rebound congestion. If coughing is the primary symptom caused by the virus, then a cough syrup can be of benefit. It can help to suppress coughs, making it easier to sleep at night and manage symptoms during the day. However, it's also essential to choose the correct type of cough syrup as some are designed for dry coughs while others target a productive or wet cough. However, if you experience severe symptoms such as high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe headaches, it's time to seek professional medical care. These symptoms can be an indication of a more serious condition that requires a medical assessment by a healthcare professional.
