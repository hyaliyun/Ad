Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 11 of its major languages official status), which was seen by them as a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation. Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system. Some other languages have received semiofficial recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. It is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools, and English language is a compulsory subject.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

This rebirth can be traced to the movement of New Urbanism and postmodern architecture's embrace of classical elements as ironic, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith, began to consider classicism seriously. While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the University of Virginia, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully. Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence. Today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style, since a generation of architects trained in this discipline shapes urban planning.

However, embracing vulnerability can help us grow and become more resilient. Here are five steps to help you find your vulnerability and strengthen your ability to cope with difficult situations. 1. Identify Your Vulnerabilities: It can be difficult to identify the things that make us vulnerable to emotional pain. However, taking the time to reflect on your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can help you recognize triggers that leave you feeling exposed. 2. Take Small Steps: Exposing yourself to situations that make you feel vulnerable can be daunting. However, taking small steps to gradually expose yourself can help you build the confidence to face challenges head-on. 3. Have a Forgetting Ritual: Dwelling on negative experiences and emotions can be draining. Instead, develop a forgetting ritual - a physical or mental action that represents letting go of difficult experiences and moving on. 4. Put Less Stock in What Others Think: We often rely on external validation to feel secure, which can leave us feeling vulnerable to others' opinions. However, recognizing that we cannot control what others think can help us focus on our own internal values and beliefs. 5. Distract Yourself from Hard Feelings: When we feel vulnerable or exposed, it's easy to get caught up in negative emotions. Instead, focus your attention on something else - whether it's a hobby, exercise, or spending time with loved ones. In conclusion, embracing our vulnerabilities can be a powerful tool for growth and resilience. By identifying our triggers, taking small steps, embracing forgetting rituals, putting less stock in what others think, and distracting ourselves from hard feelings, we can build our capacity to cope with whatever comes our way."},{"prompt":"The breakfast buffet used to be very good, but both the size and quality have diminished over recent years.

Our hands come into contact with a lot of germs and bacteria throughout the day, and when we touch our face, we introduce those germs and bacteria to our nose, mouth, and eyes. This can lead to illnesses, infections, and even exacerbate existing health conditions. To reduce the likelihood of contracting illnesses, it's important to avoid touching your face as much as possible. This can be a lot harder than it sounds, as many of us touch our faces without even realizing it. However, with some conscious effort, you can minimize the number of times you touch your face throughout the day. One way to avoid touching your face is to keep your hands busy. Fidget toys, stress balls, or simply holding a pen or pencil can give your hands something to do, reducing your urge to touch your face. Additionally, practicing good hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly and avoiding touching surfaces in public places, can also help reduce your risk of infection. Another way to curb the habit of touching your face is to practice mindfulness techniques. Mindfulness involves being present in the moment and being aware of your thoughts and actions. By staying present and aware, you can catch yourself before you touch your face and redirect your hands to other activities. In conclusion, while it may seem like a difficult habit to break, avoiding touching your face is essential to your overall health and well-being. By practicing good hygiene, keeping your hands busy, and staying present in the moment, you can reduce your risk of illness and promote a healthier lifestyle. Remember, not touching your face is a small action that can have a big impact on your health."},{"prompt":"Life as i know it is relatively enjoyable .

Try a pencil eraser. Use toothpaste.","completion":"When it comes to removing stains, there are numerous methods that you can try. However, some of them may be more effective than others. If you are dealing with a tough stain, it's always best to start with the basics. Here are three simple ways to remove a stain: 1. Wipe the Stain with a Clean, Damp Cloth This is the first and most basic step to try when tackling a stain. It's important to act fast and remove as much of the stain as possible before it sets in. Start by blotting the stain gently with a clean, damp cloth. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can cause it to spread or set in deeper. Repeat the process until the stain is no longer visible. 2. Try a Pencil Eraser If wiping the stain with a damp cloth doesn't work, try using a pencil eraser. This trick works well for small stains, such as ink or food stains on clothing. Simply rub the eraser over the stain gently until it starts to lift. Be sure to use a clean eraser, and avoid applying too much pressure, as this can damage the fabric. 3. Use Toothpaste Toothpaste isn't just for cleaning teeth. It can also be used to remove stubborn stains. This method works best for stains on hard surfaces, such as countertops or walls. Squeeze a small amount of toothpaste onto the stain and rub it in gently with a damp cloth. Let the toothpaste sit for a few minutes, then wipe it away with a clean, damp cloth. Repeat the process until the stain is gone. In conclusion, removing stains can be a tedious and frustrating process. However, by using these simple methods, you can easily tackle stains and keep your clothes and surfaces looking clean and fresh. Don't be afraid to experiment with different methods until you find the right one for your particular stain."},{"prompt":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: James Wilkinson, Ms. Rice's communications director, was shoved against a wall by guards as he tried to enter the meeting.

Brazil says at least four Brazilians were among the dead. Calderon says criminals are extorting migrants as Mexican government weakens cartels. Three suspects and a member of the Mexican military were killed in a shootout. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"At least 19 dead bodies were found in northern Mexico near the US border, and it is believed that they were Central and South American migrants who were crossing the country. Brazilian authorities confirmed that at least four Brazilians were among the dead. The discovery was made on November 20th, 2019, in the municipality of Camargo in Tamaulipas, a state known for its violence and drug trafficking. Mexican President, Felipe Calderon, stated on his Twitter profile that the situation is a result of the Mexican government's weak stance on the drug cartels, which is leading to criminal organizations controlling the migrant routes and extorting money from the migrants. Mr. Calderon blames the current government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for not acting fast and thoroughly to uproot cartel activity throughout the country. According to the state prosecutor's office, three suspects and a member of the Mexican military were killed in a shootout that began when patrol officers found a truck that was believed to be holding the migrants. The perpetrators of this heinous act dumped the dead bodies in a remote area to avoid detection, and it is yet unknown who they were and what their intentions were. The migration of people from Central and South America to the US via Mexico has been on the rise in recent years, and many of them have fallen victim to the oppression of cartels that exert control over the routes. The current situation leaves people in despair, with no other options but to risk their lives in hopes of a better future. This tragedy calls for a systematic and prompt response from the Mexican government to uproot the cartels' activities and secure the country's borders, enabling people to migrate safely and legally. The Mexican government must take steps to alleviate the plight of these migrants and work with other countries in the region to address the underlying causes of migration, providing better economic opportunities and fighting against corruption and criminal activity."},{"prompt":"Next question: when is the world cup going to end?","completion":"The current World Cup is not ongoing, the next World Cup is scheduled to be held from November 21 to December 18, 2022."},{"prompt":"hasabuiltinrechargeablebatterypackwithanoperatingtimeofapproximately12hoursandalsocomeswithaSubconnconnectorforattachingacamera.

Sudden failures, although rare, can also occur. Early red LEDs were notable for their short service life. With the development of highpower LEDs the devices are subjected to higher junction temperatures and higher current densities than traditional devices. This causes stress on the material and may cause early lightoutput degradation.

In 1976, the Lebanese Civil War was raging on, and the Syrian government, led by President Hafez al-Assad, decided to intervene on behalf of the Lebanese Christian factions that were fighting against the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and its allies. The Syrian troops helped stabilize the situation in the country and provided support for the Christian militias, effectively turning the tide of the war against the PLO. However, this intervention was not without controversy, as it violated the sovereignty of Lebanon and caused tensions between the two countries. In 1982, a few years after the Syrian intervention, a cease-fire agreement was reached between the warring parties in Lebanon, following the invasion of the country by Israeli forces. The agreement was brokered by the United States and called for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon and the implementation of a multinational force to monitor the situation. While the cease-fire agreement was a significant milestone in ending the conflict in Lebanon, it came after the Syrian intervention, which had already played a crucial role in changing the course of the war. The events that led to these two milestones were complex and intertwined, and their impact on Lebanon and the region as a whole remains a topic of debate and analysis. In conclusion, Hal al-Assad sending troops into Lebanon happened before the cease-fire agreement.

In order to calculate this difference, one must first identify the lengths of the longest and shortest touchdown plays. Let's assume that we are analyzing a single game and have access to the full play-by-play data. We can start by scanning through each touchdown play to identify the length of the play in yards. Once we have identified the length of the longest and shortest touchdown plays, we can simply subtract the length of the shortest touchdown from the length of the longest touchdown to determine the difference in yards. For example, let's say that in a particular game the longest touchdown was a 75-yard pass and the shortest touchdown was a 1-yard run. To calculate the difference in yardage between these two plays, we would subtract 1 from 75 to get a total difference of 74 yards. This information can be useful in a number of ways, including analyzing the overall offensive performance of the teams, identifying which types of plays are more effective in certain situations (such as long passes or short runs near the goal line), and determining which plays had the greatest impact on the outcome of the game. In conclusion, the difference in yardage between the longest and shortest touchdowns scored in a football game provides valuable insight into the dynamics and intensity of the game.

With the right equipment and techniques, players can survive and thrive in this virtual world. In this article, we will focus on how to defend against mobs using a bow. Step 1: Obtain a bow The first step in defending against mobs with a bow is to obtain one. Bows can be crafted by using string and sticks, or they can be obtained from various sources, such as trading with villagers or looting in dungeons. Step 2: Keep your distance When facing mobs, it is important to keep your distance. Bows are best used from a distance, as they allow the player to attack without risking close combat. This is particularly helpful when dealing with mobs that can deal significant damage, such as zombies or skeletons. Step 3: Shoot it three times When attacking mobs with a bow, it is essential to aim and shoot accurately. Mobs can move quickly, making it challenging to hit them with just one shot. Aiming for the head can deal more damage, and aiming for the legs or feet can slow down the mob. Shoot each mob three times to take them down. Step 4: Build a dirt tower If there are multiple mobs attacking, it is advisable to build a dirt tower. This will allow the player to retreat to a vantage point and attack the mobs from a higher position. Dirt is easy to obtain and can be crafted into blocks quickly. Step 5: Create arrow holes or a roof post When retreating to a dirt tower, it's best to create some arrow holes to attack the mobs while remaining safe. Additionally, creating a roof post can provide cover against mobs that can attack from the air, such as phantoms. Step 6: Enchant your bow Finally, it's essential to enchant your bow. Enchantments can improve the bow's accuracy and inflict more damage on the mobs. Enchantments can be achieved through enchanting tables, librarians, or enchanting books. In conclusion, using a bow to defend against mobs in Minecraft requires careful planning and effective execution. By following these steps, players can gain an advantage against various mobs and increase their chances of survival in this virtual world."},{"prompt":"Please add punctuation to this: Hotel Zagreb Pore Location Driving directio","completion":"Hotel Zagreb Poreč.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding the exact number of rebellious towns, historians generally agree that the events of 1704 were significant in challenging Spanish authority in the region. The uprising highlighted the discontent of the colonists with their treatment at the hands of the Spanish government, and it played a role in sparking further rebellions in the following years. Ultimately, the rebellion of 1704 marked a turning point in the struggle for independence in the Spanish colonies, and its impact can still be felt in the region's political and social landscape today."},{"prompt":"ere are two sentences: He was convicted by a Ventura County Superior Court jury and sentenced in absentia to 124 years in prison .

After DNA replication is complete, the cell must physically separate the two copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membranebound cells.:18.2 In prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membranebound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase.:18.1 What is another thing the cell must do once DNA replication is complete?","completion":"The cell must physically separate the two copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells."},{"prompt":"Which is the best book for Python beginners to advance?

Others of note are Wild at Heart, From Dusk Til Dawn, and to a certain extent Natural Born Killers. Good films like those spawned junk like Highway 666, Destiny Turns on the Radio and this ineptly surreal antimasterpiece Under The Hula Moon. It's a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone, attains it, but keeps going to the point of irritation.

To begin, you'll want to right-click on the USB drive's partition in Disk Management. Once you've done this, you'll see a menu of options pop up. Among these options, you'll want to select \\"Format\\". This will bring up a new window that will allow you to customize the formatting process. One of the first things you'll want to do is select \\"FAT32\\" as the file system. This is the most commonly used file system for USB drives and is compatible with most operating systems. It's important to note that if you have a particularly large USB drive, you may want to consider using a different file system such as NTFS. Next, you'll want to uncheck the \\"Perform a quick format\\" box. While a quick format may seem like a faster option, it can leave behind remnants of previous data and make your USB drive less reliable. It's best to take the extra time to perform a full format and ensure that your USB drive is clean and ready to use. Once you've made these selections, simply click \\"OK\\" and the formatting process will begin. Depending on the size of your USB drive, this process may take a few minutes. Once it's complete, you'll have a freshly formatted USB drive that's ready to be used for all your personal and professional needs. In summary, formatting a USB drive is a quick and easy process that can be done through your computer's Disk Management. By selecting \\"FAT32\\" as the file system and unchecking the \\"Perform a quick format\\" box, you'll ensure that your USB drive is formatted properly and ready for use. With these simple steps, you can ensure that your important files are stored safely and securely on your USB drive."},{"prompt":"February 29, 2000 Received 2/29/00 11:30 am Posted 2/29/00 11:30 am Dear Producers and Shippers, In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.

But where do you start? How do you come up with lyrics that accurately capture how you feel? The key is to focus on the person you're writing the song for. In this article, we'll take you through the steps of how to create a song for the girl you love. Step 1: Create a List of Words Start by brainstorming a list of words that relate to the girl you're writing the song for. Write down anything that comes to mind, from physical attributes to personality traits to shared experiences. Don't worry about making sense or being poetic - this is just a brainstorming session. Step 2: Arrange the Words into Phrases Once you have a list of words, start to arrange them into phrases or statements. Focus on creating lines that capture the essence of who she is and how she makes you feel. Play around with different combinations until you find something that works. Don't be afraid to be vulnerable or romantic - this is a love song, after all. Step 3: Incorporate the \\"Possibles\\" List Take a look at your original list of words and phrases and see if there are any additional ones you can incorporate into your song. These might be words that didn't quite fit in your earlier lines, but that you still want to include. Try to work them into longer lines or connecting lines to create a cohesive song. Step 4: Create a Title Once you have your lyrics written, it's time to create a title. This title should capture the essence of the song and the person it's written for. Think about the main theme or emotion of your song, and use that as a starting point. You can also draw inspiration from your list of words and phrases. Writing a song for someone you love can be a daunting task, but it's also one of the most rewarding things you can do. By focusing on the person you're writing for and using your words to capture how they make you feel, you can create a heartfelt and meaningful tribute to your love.

Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms, including runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, and skin rashes. If you suspect that you have an allergy, it's important to seek medical advice. The first step in determining whether you have an allergy is to talk to your general practitioner. Your GP will be able to ask you questions about your symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle to help determine whether you have an allergy. If your GP suspects that you may have an allergy, they may suggest further tests to confirm the diagnosis. One of the tests that your GP may suggest is a visual inspection of your nasal cavity. This involves using a small camera to look inside your nose to see if there are any signs of inflammation or swelling. Another test that your GP may suggest is an allergy skin prick test. This test involves applying a small amount of allergen to your skin and then pricking the surface to see if there is a reaction. This is a quick and safe test that can help to confirm whether you have an allergy. If the skin prick test is not conclusive, your GP may suggest an allergy blood test. This test involves taking a blood sample and analyzing it for antibodies that are produced in response to allergens. This test can be more accurate than a skin prick test but can take longer to get the results. If your symptoms are severe or your GP suspects that you may have a more serious condition, they may suggest that you undergo a CT scan. This is a type of X-ray that can provide detailed images of the inside of your body. A CT scan may be helpful in identifying any underlying conditions that could be causing your symptoms. In conclusion, if you suspect that you have an allergy, it's important to seek medical advice. Your GP can help to determine whether you have an allergy and suggest appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis. Talk to your GP, have a visual inspection of your nasal cavity, take an allergy skin prick test, have an allergy blood test, and undergo a CT scan if necessary.

But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn. 'Presque Rien' might not be the most exciting film ever made; but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the preconceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme.
