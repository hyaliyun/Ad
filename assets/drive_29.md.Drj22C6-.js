This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was British Indophobia, which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and nonracialessentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English commonsense view that Indians constituted a separate, inferior and unimprovable race.

This timeout will help them understand that there are consequences for not following rules and that they need to take them seriously.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.

When most people think of coupons, they think of a certain percentage or dollar amount off of a product or service. But, there are many other creative ideas that can make your coupons stand out and entice potential customers. For example, instead of just offering a discount, try offering a buy-one-get-one-free promotion or a free gift with purchase. This encourages customers to spend more and feel like they are getting a better deal. You can also offer coupons for exclusive experiences or limited-time offers to create a sense of urgency and scarcity. Another creative coupon idea is to give away something for free that is related to your business. For instance, if you own a bakery, you could offer a free cookbook with a purchase or a free cupcake on your customer’s birthday. The possibilities are endless when it comes to creating unique coupons that will grab people’s attention. Just make sure that the coupon aligns with your brand and business goals. And, remember to keep track of your coupon campaign’s success by analyzing the data and feedback from customers.

Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place. Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling 4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007. They also argue that the Federal Reserve’s classification of CRA loans as “prime” is based on the faulty and selfserving assumption that highinterestrate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal “subprime” loans.

Find out about your girlfriend’s past.","completion":"Jealousy can be a powerful and overwhelming emotion, but it is important to recognize that it often stems from deeper emotions. If you find yourself feeling jealous in your relationship, take a moment to evaluate why that might be. Is it because you fear your partner might leave you for someone else? Or perhaps because you feel insecure about your own worth? Understanding the root of your jealousy can help you address those underlying insecurities and improve your relationship. One way to address jealousy in a relationship is to evaluate your partner's self-confidence. If your girlfriend lacks confidence in herself, she may feel threatened by other women and become jealous easily. Encourage her to take up new hobbies or activities that boost her self-esteem, and be sure to offer praise and encouragement when she achieves something great. Another factor to consider is your girlfriend's past experiences. If she has been hurt or betrayed in the past, she may be more likely to feel jealous in her current relationship. Talk to your girlfriend about her past experiences and be understanding of any lingering emotional wounds she may be carrying. By addressing these issues together, you'll be more likely to build trust and open communication in your relationship. Ultimately, jealousy can be a tricky emotion to navigate, but it is important to remember that it often stems from deeper emotions such as insecurity or fear of loss. By addressing these underlying issues and supporting your partner's self-esteem, you can build a strong and healthy relationship based on trust and mutual respect."},{"prompt":"Generate an approximately fifteenword sentence that describes all this data: London, leaderTitle, Parliament of the United Kingdom; London, governingBody, Greater London Authority; Alfred Garth Jones, deathPlace, Sidcup; Alfred Garth Jones, deathPlace, Londo","completion":"London serves as the leaderTitle of Parliament of the United Kingdom and the governingBody of Greater London Authority; Alfred Garth Jones died in Sidcup and London."},{"prompt":"wever there are many other irregularities waiting to be clarified.

While many may be disappointed to hear that four of the five fish will be dissected, it is important to note that dissection can provide valuable information for researchers. By studying the fish's anatomy and biological makeup, scientists can learn more about the species and its behavior. Overall, the survival of these five Japanese beakfish is a testament to the resilience of marine life, and a reminder that even the most unexpected journeys can lead to new discoveries."},{"prompt":"Same meaning?

This feat has been achieved by multiple quarterbacks, including Tony Romo, Tom Brady, and Brett Favre. The 99-yard touchdown pass requires significant skill, perfect timing, and a bit of luck. It also requires a receiver who can outmaneuver defenders and run the entire length of the field without getting caught. The first 99-yard touchdown pass in NFL history occurred in 1983 when Ron Jaworski of the Philadelphia Eagles threw a long pass to Mike Quick, who ran the remaining distance for the touchdown. Since then, only a handful of quarterbacks have been able to complete this impressive feat. The most recent 99-yard touchdown pass was thrown by Eli Manning of the New York Giants in 2011. It happened during a game against the Jets, where Victor Cruz caught the pass and ran 99 yards to score the touchdown. This incredible play proved to be one of the defining moments of the game and still stands as the longest touchdown pass in the history of the NFL. In conclusion, the longest touchdown pass in the NFL is 99 yards. It requires a combination of skill, timing, and a bit of luck. Players who achieve this feat cement their name in the history books of the NFL and provide fans with unforgettable moments on the field."},{"prompt":"Article: Pantheism holds that God is the universe and the universe is God, whereas Panentheism holds that God contains, but is not identical to, the Universe.

Share your concerns with your best friend to maintain honesty. Establish the boundaries of your new relationship to avoid misunderstandings. Avoid making assumptions about what your partner wants.","completion":"When it comes to transitioning from friendship to a romantic relationship, communication is key. Starting a relationship with someone who you already have a strong connection with can be exhilarating, but it can also be challenging. It’s important to maintain honesty and clarity in order to avoid misunderstandings and preserve the friendship that you already have. The first step when considering starting a relationship with a friend is to be upfront about your feelings. It’s best to state your interest simply and clearly to avoid any confusion. This can be difficult, but it’s necessary in order to prevent the other person from feeling blindsided or caught off guard. Being honest about your feelings can also lead to a more productive and open conversation with your friend. Once you’ve expressed your interest, it’s important to share any concerns that you have with your friend. You may worry about losing the friendship or causing discomfort in the group dynamic. Talking through these concerns with someone you trust can help you gain better insight into the situation. Another crucial step is establishing boundaries. A new romantic relationship can be exciting, but it’s important to remember that you and your friend were friends first. Discussing boundaries can help you both navigate the new dynamic and avoid unintentionally crossing lines. This can include things like public vs. private displays of affection, date nights vs. group hangouts, or time spent together vs. time spent with the larger friend group. Lastly, it’s important to avoid making assumptions about what your new partner wants. Both parties should have open and honest communication about their expectations and desires. Assuming that your partner wants the same things as you can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. All in all, starting a romantic relationship with a friend can be a wonderful thing, but it requires careful consideration and communication. With honesty, transparency, and clear boundaries, you can navigate this transition while preserving the strong friendship that brought you together in the first place."},{"prompt":"Write highlights for this article: JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN","completion":")- Highlights: - Location: Johannesburg, South Africa - Topic: Unspecified article related to Johannesburg (not provided) - No additional information provided to create highlights"},{"prompt":"w would someone go about accomplishing this goal?

Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere.

Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon.

Washington admitted they might have inadvertently encouraged Argentina.","completion":"In the early 1980s, the United States found itself in a delicate situation regarding Argentina. The country was ruled by a military dictatorship that had come to power through a coup in 1976. The regime was notorious for its human rights violations, which had led to widespread condemnation from the international community. Despite this, the US maintained diplomatic relations with Argentina, viewing it as an important ally in the region. However, behind the scenes, there were concerns about Argentina's confidence in the US. In 1982, CIA boss William Casey raised these concerns with the Reagan administration. He worried that Argentina might be emboldened by its close ties with the US and could undertake aggressive actions, such as a military takeover of the Falkland Islands, which were then under British control. His concerns were not unfounded. Just a few months later, Argentina did indeed invade the Falklands, sparking a war with the UK. As the conflict escalated, Washington found itself in a difficult position. On the one hand, it had to support its close ally, the UK. On the other hand, it could not be seen as abandoning Argentina, with which it had maintained close ties. In the aftermath of the war, Washington admitted that it might have inadvertently encouraged Argentina. The Reagan administration came under heavy criticism for its handling of the situation, with some commentators accusing it of turning a blind eye to the dictatorship's human rights abuses in order to maintain its strategic interests. The events of the early 1980s illustrate the complexities of US foreign policy. The US must balance its own interests with its responsibilities to the international community. In the case of Argentina, it found itself torn between its desire for a stable ally in the region and its commitment to human rights and the rule of law. Ultimately, it was a difficult lesson in the consequences of unintended consequences."},{"prompt":"Trivia question: Which Southern English city has districts called Shirley, Bassett Green and Thornhill ?

Allow the strawberries to sit for 2030 minutes.","completion":"Removing the stems from strawberries is a common practice before consuming them. However, it is often overlooked that allowing the strawberries to sit for 20-30 minutes after removing their stems can enhance their flavor and texture. When strawberries are harvested, enzymes within the fruit begin to break down its complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars. This process, known as ripening, is what gives strawberries their characteristic sweet taste. However, if the strawberries are picked when they are not fully ripe, they can lack the full depth of flavor expected from the fruit. Allowing the strawberries to sit for a short period after removing their stems can help to trigger the ripening process. The enzymes within the fruit continue to break down the complex carbohydrates and create new flavor compounds, resulting in a sweeter, more flavorful berry. In addition to enhancing their flavor, allowing strawberries to sit after removing their stems can also improve their texture. Strawberries contain a significant amount of water, which makes them prone to becoming soggy or mushy. By removing the stems and allowing the strawberries to sit, some of the excess water can drain away, resulting in a firmer texture that is more pleasing to the palate. To take advantage of this delicious and simple technique, start by removing the stems from your strawberries using a sharp knife or a specialized tool designed for this purpose. Then, place the strawberries in a bowl and allow them to sit for 20-30 minutes at room temperature. Once the time has passed, the strawberries will be sweeter, firmer, and more delicious overall. In conclusion, removing the stems from strawberries is an essential step in preparing them for consumption. However, taking the extra step to allow the strawberries to sit for 20-30 minutes afterward can result in a more flavorful and enjoyable eating experience. So, the next time you have fresh strawberries, try removing the stems and waiting a bit before digging in.

The taste receptors are located around the small structures known as papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus, the cheek and epiglottis. These structures are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception: salty, sour, bitter, sweet and umami; through the combination of these elements we detect \`\`flavors.'' A popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue. Via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with the taste receptors. These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds. The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves.

However, the actual cost of growing rice exceeds the price at which it is sold. As a result, the U.S. government pays billions of dollars in subsidies to rice farmers each year to bridge this gap. According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, the federal government spent approximately 14 billion on farm subsidies in 2019. Of that amount, rice subsidies accounted for around 1 billion. These subsidies are designed to help rice farmers remain profitable and encourage them to continue growing rice despite its high production costs. Despite these subsidies, the cost of growing rice in the United States still exceeds the price at which it is sold. In fact, a 2018 study by the University of Arkansas found that the average cost of producing a hundredweight of long-grain rice was 16.63, while the average price received by farmers was only 13.71. This means that the government is spending approximately 2.92 per hundredweight on subsidies to make up the difference. While this may seem like a small amount, it quickly adds up when you consider the massive quantities of rice that are grown in the United States each year. According to USDA data, American rice farmers produced 225 million hundredweight of rice in 2019 alone. Using the above figures, this means that the government spent approximately 657 million on subsidies for rice farmers that year. In conclusion, the U.S. government pays billions of dollars in subsidies to rice farmers each year in order to support the domestic rice industry. While these subsidies help bridge the gap between the cost of production and the market price, they do not fully cover the total cost of growing rice. In 2019, the government spent approximately 657 million on rice subsidies, as the cost of production exceeded the price at which rice is sold."},{"prompt":"Text: The Color Purple is a 1982 epistolary novel by American author Alice Walker which won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Award for Fiction.

This can help them feel more comfortable and provide an opportunity for them to ask questions or share their thoughts. Additionally, providing childcare during the service can help parents feel more at ease and allow them to fully engage in the worship experience. Beyond the service itself, it's essential to invite new visitors to church programs and events in order to deepen their engagement with the community. Whether it's a small group, a volunteer opportunity, or a special event, these activities provide an opportunity for visitors to connect with others and build relationships that can last a lifetime. Finally, following up is key when it comes to engaging with new visitors. After they attend a service or event, be sure to reach out and ask about their experience. Showing that you care about their spiritual journey can make a big difference in whether they decide to come back and become a part of your community permanently. In short, building a welcoming and inclusive church community requires genuine conversations, a willingness to invite new visitors to sit with you, providing childcare during the service, inviting new visitors to church programs and events, and following up with new visitors after their initial visit.

While many players have scored one yard touchdowns throughout the history of the sport, some have done so more frequently or memorably than others. Here are some examples of notable one yard touchdown scorers in football: - Running backs: Since they typically carry the ball closer to the goal line than other positions, running backs have some of the highest chances of scoring one yard touchdowns. Some of the all-time leaders in this category include Emmitt Smith (69 career one-yard rushing touchdowns), Shaun Alexander (61), Marcus Allen (54), John Riggins (46), and Larry Csonka (39). All of these players are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and won at least one Super Bowl during their careers. Current running backs who excel in short-yardage situations include Ezekiel Elliott, Todd Gurley, and Derrick Henry, among others. - Quarterbacks: Although they often pass or hand off the ball to running backs near the goal line, quarterbacks can also sneak into the end zone themselves by diving or lunging forward for one yard touchdowns. Some of the most successful quarterbacks in this regard include Steve Young (14 career rushing touchdowns of one yard or less), Cam Newton (13), Tom Brady (12), and Russell Wilson (11). These players are all considered dual threats who can run and pass effectively, especially in critical situations. - Receivers/tight ends: Though they usually catch touchdowns from farther away, receivers and tight ends can also score one yard touchdowns by lining up as blockers or running short routes that fool defenders. Some of the notable players who have done this in the past include Mike Vrabel, a former linebacker turned touchdown machine with 10 career receptions for scores, all from inside the one-yard line; Rob Gronkowski, a tight end who has scored many touchdowns in the red zone, including some from one yard out; and Hines Ward, a wide receiver known for his toughness and clutch plays, who scored nine career one-yard touchdowns. Of course, scoring one yard touchdowns is not just about individual skill or talent. It also requires good blocking, smart playcalling, and a bit of luck. Moreover, some teams may prioritize scoring touchdowns from farther away to show off their creativity or to avoid any mistakes near the goal line. Nevertheless, one yard touchdowns remain a crucial part of football strategy and history, and the players who score them deserve some recognition for their contributions to the game."},{"prompt":"This movie should not classify as cinema.

Burke's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources. His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism. Philip Francis wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of MarieAntoinette was pure foppery. Edward Gibbon, however, reacted differently: I adore his chivalry. Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the Duchesse de Biron, that when MarieAntoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it.

OPTIONS: Yes It's impossible to say No","completion":"It's impossible to say."},{"prompt":"Write an article that answers the following question: Were there more yards in touchdowns or field goals in the first half?","completion":"In any given football game, touchdowns and field goals serve as the primary methods of scoring points. In the first half of a game, it is common for both teams to put up a significant amount of points in an effort to establish a lead. To determine whether there were more yards in touchdowns or field goals during the first half of a game, one would need to gather specific information regarding the scoring methods used by both teams. If a team scores a touchdown, they are awarded six points. The ball must be carried or caught in the end zone in order for the touchdown to count. Field goals, on the other hand, are worth three points each and are typically attempted when a team is unable to score a touchdown. In order to successfully kick a field goal, the ball must be kicked through the opposing team's goalposts. Throughout the first half of a football game, it is not uncommon for both touchdowns and field goals to be scored. However, the total number of yards accumulated during either type of scoring play can vary greatly. For example, a touchdown may involve a long pass down the field or a run by a running back that covers a significant amount of ground. A field goal, on the other hand, may only require a few yards to be gained in order to put the kicker within range. In order to determine whether there were more yards gained by touchdowns or field goals in the first half of a game, one would need to look at the individual scoring plays of both teams. By adding up the total number of yards gained during each scoring play, one could arrive at a total for both touchdowns and field goals. A comparison of the two totals would then reveal which scoring method resulted in more yards. In conclusion, it is impossible to say definitively whether there were more yards gained in touchdowns or field goals during the first half of a football game without examining individual scoring plays. While touchdowns may involve more yards on average, the shorter range required for a field goal means that they too can result in a significant number of yards. Ultimately, the choice to attempt a touchdown or field goal will depend on a variety of factors including the game situation and the skill level of the players involved."},{"prompt":"Generate an approximately fifteenword sentence that describes all this data: A.F.C.

The usual design is that the camera's parameters for interpreting the sensor data values into sRGB values are fixed, and a number of different EI choices are accommodated by varying the sensor's signal gain in the analog realm, prior to conversion to digital. Some camera designs provide at least some EI choices by adjusting the sensor's signal gain in the digital realm.

Of course, when something provokes thought, it can then be scrutinized. The reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions. The link that What the Bleep... would have you see between science and spirituality is, in fact, not rooted in science at all. The Transcendental Meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area, Washington D.C. in this case. In reality the HRA (Homicides, Rapes, and Assaults) crime rate was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 19881992. There was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study. In fact, each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked. My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. Either way, I suggest that you do not waste your time.

This demand comes just three months after asking for an extra £10 billion, leaving many questioning the EU's financial management. The Eurocrats in charge have stated that the sudden flurry of invoices at the end of the financial year is to blame for the shortfall. However, this explanation has done little to dispel the growing concerns around the EU's financial management. Leading Conservative MEP, Marta Andreasen, has been one of the most vocal critics of the EU's financial management, accusing the institution of treating public money with disdain. This latest demand for extra funding is only likely to fuel her anger and that of others who believe that the EU's financial practices are becoming increasingly unsustainable. At a time when many member states are already facing significant economic challenges, the EU's request for additional funding is likely to cause further tensions.

Greek allies had their own traditional cults to rulers as divine benefactors, and offered similar cult to Caesar's successor, Augustus, who accepted with the cautious proviso that expatriate Roman citizens refrain from such worship; it might prove fatal. By the end of his reign, Augustus had appropriated Rome's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his reformed and thoroughly integrated system of government. Towards the end of his life, he cautiously allowed cult to his numen. By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed, first in the Eastern Provinces, then in the West. Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context; bathhouses, shrines and temples to Roman and local deities, amphitheatres and festivals. In the early Imperial period, the promotion of local elites to Imperial priesthood gave them Roman citizenship. What form of government did Cesar seem to be attempting? What is the answer?

The protests, predominantly peaceful in nature, were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement and aimed to challenge the current political and economic systems. Similar protests have been held in cities around the world, including London where Julian Assange addressed the crowd. The calls for the protests began on Facebook and Twitter, as social media platforms continue to play an influential role in mobilizing masses for political and social causes. While the vast majority of protesters remain peaceful, some have engaged in violent behavior, leading to confrontations with police. This has led to concerns about the effectiveness of these protests, and whether or not they ultimately help or harm the causes they aim to support. Despite the clashes, the Occupation movement has gained significant attention and has raised important questions about inequality, economic justice, and democracy. The movement has brought together people from diverse backgrounds and has created a platform for social and political engagement, making it an important development in contemporary politics. However, the success of the movement ultimately depends on its ability to engage and mobilize a wider population. As the protests continue to unfold, it will be important to assess their effectiveness in creating real change and a more just society."},{"prompt":"Context:Before we did that we got some dinner at a small authentic Serbian restaurant simply called ' ?

But Chris Christie declined to spend time campaigning for 'Cooch,' even though his own New jersey race was a cakewalk. And the Republican Governors Association, some Virginia GOP insiders think, abandoned them when victory was within reach. Now Cuccinelli claims Christie's 'Bridgegate' scandal will drag down other governors, meaning he should step down as the RGA's chairman. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Losing candidate for Virginia governor, Ken Cuccinelli, is calling for Chris Christie to step down as chairman of the Republican Governors Association (RGA) after the organization allegedly shut off the money spigot in Cuccinelli's political race. Despite closing a considerable gap in the final weeks of the election, Cuccinelli lost by a narrow margin to his opponent, Bill Clinton's former fundraising chief. Cuccinelli's frustration stems from the fact that even though his race was potentially winnable, Christie, who was at the time RGA chairman, declined to spend time campaigning for him. Meanwhile, Christie's own race for governor of New Jersey was considered a cakewalk. Some Virginia GOP insiders share Cuccinelli's sentiment, claiming that the RGA abandoned them when victory was within reach. Now, with Christie embroiled in the scandal surrounding the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge, Cuccinelli believes that Christie's negative image will drag down other governors associated with the RGA. Therefore, he is calling for Christie to step down as chairman of the organization. Christie's involvement in the Bridgegate scandal has brought unwanted attention to the RGA, and Cuccinelli fears that other Republican governors may suffer the consequences. While some may see Cuccinelli's call for Christie's resignation as an attempt to shift blame for his own loss, it is clear that the RGA's involvement, or lack thereof, in Virginia's gubernatorial race has caused tension between the organization and some members of the Virginia Republican party. As the RGA works towards the 2022 midterm elections, it remains to be seen whether Christie will retain his position as chairman, or if Cuccinelli's calls for his resignation will gain momentum within the organization. For now, Virginia GOP insiders and losing candidate Ken Cuccinelli believe that Christie's association with the RGA is more of a hindrance than a help."},{"prompt":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: GM has initiated criminal investigations in Germany and the US on the basis of their suspicions that Mr Lopez and his team stole confidential information before defecting to VW in March.

She worked as mental health carer and had articles published in the Journal of Health Psychology. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said ban was to ‘protect the public’ and prevent ‘misery’ Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"A former pupil of A-star Catholic girls' school died after suffering a heart attack recently. She had been working as a mental health carer and also had articles published in the Journal of Health Psychology. While this may seem like a tragedy in and of itself, it's compounded by the fact that Home Office minister Jeremy Browne has recently called for a ban on certain drugs in order to \\"protect the public\\" and prevent \\"misery.\\" It's unclear which drugs Browne specifically wishes to ban, but it's clear that the issue of drug use and abuse is one that frequently surfaces in discussions about mental health. On the one hand, drugs can help people manage their conditions and lead more normal lives. On the other hand, they can be expensive, addictive, and even lethal. Given the recent death of a mental health worker, one can't help but wonder whether policies aimed at curtailing drug use are really the best way to prevent \\"misery\\" in the long run. After all, if people are denied access to drugs that may help them manage their conditions, they may resort to more dangerous means of coping. At the same time, the lack of regulation and oversight surrounding certain drugs can also make them risky. Ultimately, the issue of drug use and mental health is a complex one that requires thoughtful consideration and debate. While banning certain substances may seem like a straightforward solution, it's important to weigh the potential benefits against the possible harms. As we mourn the death of a promising mental health carer, we must also reflect on what we can do to ensure that those who struggle with mental health have access to the resources and support they need to live full and healthy lives."},{"prompt":"Ask a question about Queen Victoria.","completion":"Who was Queen Victoria and what was her impact on the British monarchy?"},{"prompt":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? 26 August 1933 Plymouth Argyle Return the answer as pairs of triples.","completion":"I'm sorry, but the sentence \\"26 August 1933 Plymouth Argyle\\" doesn't provide enough context for me to determine which concepts it is referring to.

With over 1,700 points scored, and an impressive career field goal percentage of over 87%, he has made some incredible kicks throughout his career. Looking at Gostkowski's longest and shortest field goals can help give us an idea of the range of his abilities. According to the NFL's official records, Gostkowski's longest field goal was 62 yards. He achieved this feat in a game against the Oakland Raiders in Mexico City in 2017. On the other hand, his shortest field goal was only 18 yards, which he has made multiple times throughout his career. These shorter kicks typically come during situations where the ball is turned over deep in the opponent's territory, or in blowout games where the team is comfortable taking points off the board. So, how many yards difference is there between Gostkowski's longest and shortest field goals? The answer is approximately 44 yards (62 - 18).

Use spices with intention. Make a pan sauce. Create a sauté. Learn how to caramelize. Sweat your vegetables. Blanch your veggies. Adjust the flavor. Don’t be afraid to experiment.","completion":"Cooking is an art that requires creativity, experimentation, and attention to detail. Whether you are an experienced chef or a novice in the kitchen, there are always new techniques and skills to learn that can take your dishes to the next level. In this article, we will discuss some essential tips for transforming an ordinary recipe into a mouthwatering masterpiece. One of the easiest ways to elevate a recipe is by using spices with intention. Spices are the backbone of any flavorful dish, and when used correctly, they can bring out the best of the ingredients. Invest in a good collection of spices and experiment with different combinations to find the ones that work well together. Remember, a little goes a long way, so start with small quantities and adjust as needed. Another crucial technique is making a pan sauce. A pan sauce is a sauce made from the juices left in the pan after cooking meat or vegetables. To make a pan sauce, deglaze the pan by adding a flavorful liquid like wine or broth and scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. This will add depth and complexity to your dish. Sautéing is another skill that every cook should master. To achieve a perfectly sautéed dish, use high heat and plenty of oil, and make sure to toss the ingredients frequently to prevent burning. Sautéed vegetables are a healthy and delicious side dish, and they can add color and texture to any plate. Caramelizing is a technique that involves browning sugar or other sweeteners to create a rich, golden-brown color and deep, toasty flavor. Caramelizing can be used on everything from vegetables to meats and even fruit. Use a heavy-bottomed pan and low-medium heat for best results. Sweating vegetables is a technique that involves cooking them in a covered pan with a small amount of oil or butter. Sweating vegetables will release their moisture, making them softer and more flavorful. This cooking method is best for delicate vegetables such as onions, garlic, and mushrooms. Blanching is a cooking technique that involves briefly boiling vegetables or fruit and then plunging them into ice water to stop the cooking process. Blanching is an excellent way to preserve the color and texture of the produce while removing any unwanted bacteria. Lastly, never be afraid to experiment with flavors and ingredients. Adjust the seasoning to your liking, add new ingredients to an old recipe, and try cooking techniques you’ve never tried before. Cooking is all about creativity, so let your imagination run wild. In conclusion, cooking is a wonderful hobby that can be both fun and rewarding. By incorporating these essential tips into your cooking routine, you can transform an ordinary recipe into a culinary masterpiece. Remember to use spices with intention, make a pan sauce, sauté your vegetables, caramelize sugar, sweat your vegetables, blanch your produce, adjust the flavors, and always experiment.

Add pigment for bolder colors. Apply the plaster","completion":"When it comes to plastering, there are a few techniques you should know to make sure your finish is flawless. One of the most important aspects of plastering is mixing the compound correctly. Avoid under- or over-mixing the plaster, as this can lead to a poor finish and decrease the strength of the compound. Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions when it comes to mixing ratios and timings. If you want to achieve bolder colors, add pigment to your plaster mixture. This is a simple way to customize your plaster finish without having to use paint or other materials. Start with a small amount of pigment and test it on a small area before applying it to the entire surface. Once the plaster is mixed and any pigments are added, it's time to apply it to the surface. Make sure to work in small sections and apply the plaster evenly. Use a trowel or similar tool to spread the plaster and smooth out any bumps or imperfections. Make sure not to apply too much pressure, as this can lead to ridges and an uneven finish. When applying multiple layers of plaster, make sure to wait for each layer to dry before applying the next one. This will ensure that the surface is even and smooth. Finally, make sure to clean up any excess plaster or tools once the job is complete. In conclusion, mixing plaster correctly and knowing how to apply it are key to achieving a flawless finish. Keep in mind the importance of avoiding under- or over-mixing, adding pigments for custom colors, and working in small sections to ensure an even finish. With these tips in mind, you'll be well on your way to mastering the art of plastering."},{"prompt":"f a dish includes 'Du Barry' in its name what ingredient does it contain?","completion":"If a dish includes 'Du Barry' in its name, it typically contains cauliflower as the main ingredient."},{"prompt":"Wow!

There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush coal swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A midCarboniferous drop in sealevel precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit crinoids and ammonites especially hard.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Socialism confronted consumerism in the chain State Department Stores (GUM), set up by Lenin in 1921 as a model retail enterprise. It operated stores throughout Russia and targeted consumers across class, gender, and ethnic lines. GUM was designed to advance the Bolsheviks' goals of eliminating private enterprise and rebuilding consumerism along socialist lines, as well as democratizing consumption for workers and peasants nationwide. GUM became a major propaganda purveyor, with advertising and promotional campaigns that taught Russians the goals of the regime and attempted to inculcate new attitudes and behavior. In trying to create a socialist consumer culture from scratch, GUM recast the functions and meanings of buying and selling, turning them into politically charged acts that could either contribute to or delay the march toward utopian communism. By the late 1920s, however, GUM's gandiose goals had proven unrealistic and largely alienated consumers, who instead learned a culture of complaint and entitlement. GUM's main function became one of distributing whatever the factories sent them, regardless of consumer demand or quality.

One example of his work is a series of images from a photoshoot that involved covering a model in pints of milk, which were then captured in fast exposure shots.

JeanJacques Rousseau's Dictionnaire de musique (published 1767 in Geneva and 1768 in Paris) was a leading text in the late 18th century. This widely available dictionary gave short definitions of words like genius and taste, and was clearly influenced by the Enlightenment movement. Another text influenced by Enlightenment values was Charles Burney's A General History of Music: From the Earliest Ages to the Present Period (1776), which was a historical survey and an attempt to rationalize elements in music systematically over time. Recently, musicologists have shown renewed interest in the ideas and consequences of the Enlightenment. For example, Rose Rosengard Subotnik's Deconstructive Variations (subtitled Music and Reason in Western Society) compares Mozart's Die Zauberflöte (1791) using the Enlightenment and Romantic perspectives, and concludes that the work is an ideal musical representation of the Enlightenment.

Polish your glass to restore hard water damage.","completion":"Hard water can wreak havoc on your glass surfaces, leaving behind a buildup of minerals such as calcium and magnesium. If left untreated, these deposits can damage your glass, leaving it cloudy and unsightly. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to identify hard water buildup and restore your glass to its former shine. The first step is to identify whether hard water is the culprit behind your glass damage. Hard water can leave behind water spots, etching, or a white, hazy film on the glass. Simply examining the glass for these signs can confirm the presence of hard water deposits. Once you've determined that you have hard water buildup, it's time to assemble your supplies. You'll need a polishing agent, such as vinegar or baking soda, and a soft cloth or sponge. You may also want to invest in a commercial hard water remover for more stubborn buildup. To start the restoration process, wet the glass surface with water and sprinkle a small amount of your polishing agent onto the affected areas. Gently scrub the glass with your cloth or sponge, being careful not to scratch the surface. You may need to repeat this process several times for heavily damaged glass. If your hard water buildup is particularly stubborn, you can try using a commercial hard water remover. These products contain stronger acids that can break down mineral deposits more effectively. However, it's important to follow the instructions carefully and use caution to avoid damaging your glass. After you've removed the hard water buildup, be sure to rinse the glass thoroughly with water and dry it with a clean, soft cloth. This will help prevent any additional water spots from forming. In conclusion, identifying hard water buildup and restoring your glass to its former shine is a simple process that can be accomplished with a few household supplies. With a little elbow grease and patience, your glass surfaces can look as good as new."},{"prompt":"Problem: Solve 112 = 18*z + 46*z for z.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface.

In 2017, an outage at Amazon Web Services caused problems for millions of users, while a DDoS attack took down popular sites like Twitter and Reddit in 2016. To avoid these types of issues, experts are urging companies to invest in upgrading their infrastructure to keep up with the growing demand. This includes improving network capacity and security, as well as investing in new technologies like 5G and edge computing. If companies fail to take action, the potential losses from online downtime could cost businesses and users millions of pounds. As such, ensuring the internet infrastructure is up to par should be a top priority for anyone operating in the digital world."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence that describes the following data: Arlington, Texas, isPartOf, Texas; Texas, largestCity, Housto","completion":"Arlington, Texas is part of Texas, which has Houston as its largest city."},{"prompt":"Very trendy coffee place on McGill.

Reines is a close friend and colleague of Abedin, and has been working on the Clinton campaign to help her in any way possible. However, Reines found himself in the middle of the latest Weiner scandal when he berated the former congressman on a conference call just hours before new allegations of sexting emerged. Reines was not afraid to speak his mind and express his disappointment in Weiner's actions, despite the fact that he and Abedin have been longtime friends with the former congressman. Since the scandal broke, Reines has taken on the role of advisor to Abedin, urging her to distance herself from her husband's faltering mayoral campaign. Reines has reportedly been telling Abedin to focus on her work with the Clinton campaign and to let Weiner handle his own problems. Despite the scandal, the Clinton camp has remained relatively quiet on the issue, with Clinton herself only commenting that \\"we have no idea what will happen in that course.\\" However, Reines' involvement in the situation has raised questions about the extent of the Clinton camp's involvement in the personal lives of its top aides.

Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings, from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass and matter. As such, there is no single universally agreed scientific meaning of the word matter. Scientifically, the term mass is welldefined, but matter is not. Sometimes in the field of physics matter is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and leptons.
