This information is readily available through various sports websites and can be easily accessed by those who are interested in knowing which players contributed in this way. There are a number of factors that can influence the likelihood of a player scoring a rushing touchdown, including their position on the field, the strength of the opposing defense, and their own physical attributes and skill level. Some players are particularly well-suited to scoring rushing touchdowns, such as those who are particularly fast, strong, or agile. Some of the most notable players who have been known for scoring rushing touchdowns include Walter Payton, Emmitt Smith, Barry Sanders, and Jim Brown. These players were all incredibly talented at their positions and were both physically gifted and skilled in their ability to elude opposing defenders and find openings in the defense. Other players who have scored rushing touchdowns include quarterbacks, fullbacks, and even wide receivers. These players may not be known for their rushing ability, but they are often called upon to carry the ball in situations where the team needs to score quickly or gain vital yardage. Ultimately, the identity of the players who have scored rushing touchdowns will depend on the specific game and circumstances in which those touchdowns were scored.

Gaius Gracchus' ultimate goal was to weaken the senate and to strengthen the democratic forces. In the past, for example, the senate would eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions or by passing a senatus consultum ultimum (ultimate decree of the senate). Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared the senatus consultum ultimum to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. This last proposal was not popular with the plebeians and he lost much of his support. He stood for election to a third term in 121 BC, but was defeated and then murdered by representatives of the senate with 3,000 of his supporters on Capitoline Hill in Rome.

The fact that these captains were fined suggests that their actions were not considered acceptable by authorities, and may have been seen as a form of bribery or corruption. It is also possible that the amount of gold francs they were accused of receiving was significant enough to warrant such a penalty.

He had fled to Angola after the Rwandan genocide in 1994, but was eventually arrested in 2002. Approximately 800,000 people were killed during the genocide, which occurred over the course of just 100 days. The war crimes tribunal found Bizimungu guilty of crimes that included the murder of Tutsi civilians and the ordering of massacres in different locations around Rwanda. He was also convicted for his role in the murder of ten Belgian peacekeepers who were in Rwanda as part of a United Nations peacekeeping mission. The conviction of Bizimungu, who was once one of the most powerful figures in Rwanda's military, is significant. It represents a step towards justice for the victims of the genocide and their families, who have waited for years to see those responsible held accountable for their actions. The Rwandan genocide began in April 1994 and was the result of years of tension between the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority. Political and ethnic violence had been building for years, and the assassination of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana acted as a spark for the violence to erupt. During the genocide, Tutsi civilians were targeted for extermination by the government and extremist militia groups. The killing was carried out on a massive scale, with hundreds of thousands of people being hacked to death with machetes or shot dead. Although the conviction of Bizimungu marks a step towards justice for the victims, many other perpetrators of the genocide remain at large. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has been investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the genocide for more than two decades, but many of the accused have not been brought to justice. The verdict in the case of Augustin Bizimungu is a reminder of the horrors that occurred during the Rwandan genocide, and of the importance of ensuring that those responsible are held accountable for their actions."},{"prompt":"Trivia question: Which cable suspension road bridge, known as Galloping Gertie, was completely destroyed due to aeroelastic flutter on 7 November 1940?

Begin with the strongest evidence. Explain why the source is important or valuable. Make good use of time.","completion":"How to Answer Questions Directly with Strong Evidence Answering questions directly is a valuable skill that can make you stand out in any conversation. However, it's not enough to just give an answer; you must also be able to back it up with strong evidence from credible sources. Here's a quick guide on how to answer questions directly using solid documentation. Begin with the Strongest Evidence When answering a question, start with the strongest evidence you have that supports your point of view. This means using sources that are reliable, up-to-date, and relevant to the question being asked. For example, if you're answering a question about climate change, you might cite data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is widely regarded as the most authoritative source of scientific information on the topic. Explain Why the Source is Important or Valuable After you've presented your evidence, take a moment to explain why the source is important or valuable. This helps validate your answer and demonstrates that you've done your research. For instance, if you're citing a study published in a peer-reviewed academic journal, explain why peer review is significant and how it improves the reliability of research findings. Make Good Use of Time It's important to make good use of your time when answering questions. This means focusing on the most relevant and compelling evidence and avoiding tangents that don't directly address the question. If you're asked a difficult question and don't have a ready answer, it's okay to take a moment to gather your thoughts or ask for clarification. It's better to give a thoughtful response based on reliable evidence than to rush through an incomplete or incorrect answer. In conclusion, answering questions directly with strong evidence is an important skill that requires preparation and practice. By starting with your strongest evidence, explaining why your sources are important, and making good use of your time, you can confidently respond to any question with a well-supported answer."},{"prompt":"Attached is the Enron Americas Gas Trading notification memo for Daily Loss for May 30, 2001.

Sanders is, as one would expect, casually, indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy; indeed, the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy doubtless the Hays office insisted. Preminger's direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal. Stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words.

She wants age restrictions and controls on the amount that can be bought. 16yearold Sarah has battled anorexia for two years. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency polices drug sales. It has no plans to restrict sales but will put stronger warnings on packets.","completion":"A mother's nightmare: The call for laxative sale restrictions Carolyn Jones, a mother-of-five from Liverpool, was left in shock and distress when her 16-year-old daughter Sarah was hospitalised after taking 28 laxatives. This incident was not the only one, as the mother later found 150 packets of laxatives hidden around their home. Sarah had been battling anorexia for two years, and the use of laxatives had become a serious and dangerous problem. In the aftermath of these events, Mrs Jones is now calling for restrictions to be brought in over the sale of laxatives. She believes that age restrictions and controls on the amount that can be bought would be effective measures in preventing similar incidents from taking place. While the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency polices drug sales, it currently has no plans to restrict the sale of laxatives. Mrs Jones's call for change is not unwarranted, as the misuse of laxatives is a growing concern. Many people, particularly young girls, turn to laxatives as a means of controlling their weight. However, the misuse of these drugs can lead to serious health problems, such as dehydration, organ damage and even death. It is important that we take steps to prevent the misuse of laxatives and ensure that they are used safely and under proper guidance. While the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency may not be ready to implement stricter controls, they have agreed to put stronger warnings on packets. The case of Carolyn Jones and her daughter Sarah is a powerful reminder of the dangers of laxative misuse. It is our responsibility to take necessary actions to protect vulnerable individuals from the ill-effects of these drugs. By regulating their sales, we can ensure that they are used safely and effectively."},{"prompt":"Thomas E.

The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. Clive Stace describes this as having direct access to the genetic basis of evolution. As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals. Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below – fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.

Determine exponential smoothing.","completion":"One of the most common methods used in analyzing data is the moving averages method. This method allows you to detect trends and patterns in time-series data by calculating the average of a fixed number of periods. However, two other popular methods are the weighted moving average (WMA) and exponential smoothing, which offer greater flexibility and precision in analyzing data. The weighted moving average is similar to the traditional moving average method, but with a varying weight factor applied to each period. This means that the more recent periods are given a greater weight, producing a more accurate result. The WMA is particularly useful for volatile and seasonal data that require more attention to recent trends. Exponential smoothing is another popular method that is particularly helpful in predicting future values of a time-series data. It involves computing a weighted average of past observations, where the weight decreases exponentially as the time interval between the observation and the current period increases. This approach assigns greater importance to more recent observations, and can provide more accurate and reliable predictions. In conclusion, while the traditional moving averages method is useful in analyzing time-series data, using the weighted moving average and exponential smoothing methods can provide greater precision, particularly for volatile and seasonal data, as well as more accurate predictions. Whether you are an analyst, data scientist or a business owner, understanding these methods can help you to make more informed decisions based on accurate and insightful data."},{"prompt":"Premise: (Budget Director Frank Raines dismissed such details as boring.

The quarterback must have the arm strength and accuracy to make a long throw, while the receiver must have the speed and route-running ability to get behind the defense and make the catch. The play also requires the offensive line to provide protection for the quarterback for an extended period of time. Although the 99-yard touchdown pass is a significant accomplishment, it is not the only measure of success in football. Shorter touchdown passes, as well as rushing touchdowns and defensive touchdowns, all contribute to a team's success on the field.

Fold the remaining two sides to the same point.","completion":"When it comes to creating a perfectly folded item, whether it's a sandwich, burrito, or any other food wrapped in a similar way, it all comes down to the technique. One commonly used technique is the \\"envelope fold,\\" also known as the \\"business letter fold.\\" This technique involves bringing two adjacent sides together over the filling and then folding in the remaining two sides to meet the same point. To begin, you will need to start with a flat surface to work on, such as a cutting board or plate. Lay your tortilla or sandwich wrap out flat and add your desired fillings, spreading them evenly across the center of the wrap. Remember not to overfill your wrap, as this will make it difficult to fold and may cause it to tear. Next, take the bottom edge of the wrap and bring it up and over the filling, pressing it down slightly to create a crease. Then, take one side of the wrap and fold it in towards the center, also creating a crease. Repeat this step with the opposite side, folding it in towards the center and making sure it meets the first fold at the same point in the center of the wrap. Finally, take the top edge of the wrap and fold it down towards the center, pressing down to seal the edges. You should now have a perfectly folded \\"envelope\\" that holds all your fillings securely inside. This folding technique is not only aesthetically pleasing but it also helps to keep your fillings from falling out and makes it easier to eat on the go. It is also versatile and can be used with a variety of different fillings, from deli meats to vegetables or even breakfast items like eggs and cheese. In conclusion, the envelope fold is an easy and effective way to create a perfectly wrapped sandwich or burrito. Remember to start with a flat surface, evenly distribute your fillings, and follow the steps in the proper order. Once you master this technique, you will be able to impress your friends and family with your perfectly folded creations."},{"prompt":"libyan leader moamer kadhafi is to meet president hosni mubarak in egypt next week to discuss the fate of palestinians trapped between their nations ' borders , egypt 's mena news agency said wednesday .

To begin using this cleaning mixture, you will need to make sure that your soap is pH balanced. You can check the pH level of your soap by using pH test strips that can be purchased at most hardware stores. Once you have confirmed that your soap is pH balanced, you should mix it with water in a ratio of one tablespoon of soap per two cups of water. This mixture can be used to clean various surfaces, including floors, tiles, countertops, and even fabrics. When using the mixture, it is important to apply it to the surface and then use a soft-bristled brush or cloth to scrub away any dirt or stains. After scrubbing, rinse the surface with clean water to remove any remaining soap residue. Overall, using a mixture of pH balanced soap and water is an effective and safe way to clean various surfaces.

Not only do you have to keep the water clean and balanced, but you also need to make sure the pool deck is well-maintained. Here are some quick tips to help you keep your pool deck in top shape. First, check your baskets regularly. These are the skimmer and pump baskets that catch debris before it enters your pool's filter system. If they become too full, they can impede water flow and cause damage to your equipment. Empty them as needed to keep the water circulating properly. Next, skim the surface of your pool daily. Use a leaf skimmer to remove any leaves, insects, or other debris that have fallen into the water. This helps to prevent clogs in your filter and keeps the water looking pristine. Don't forget to brush the edges of your pool. This is especially important if you have a tiled surface, as grime can build up quickly. Use a pool brush to scrub the walls and floor of your pool, paying close attention to the water line where oils and other contaminants can accumulate. Lastly, maintain a clean pool deck. Sweep or hose down the area regularly to prevent debris from becoming slippery and posing a safety hazard. You can also use a mild detergent and a scrub brush to remove any stubborn stains. By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your pool stays clean and safe for you and your family to enjoy all summer long."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

He has always maintained his innocence and has been attempting to rebuild his career since his release. However, his attempts to return to football have been met with controversy. His former club, Sheffield United, faced fierce backlash in 2014 when they initially offered him a contract to return to the club following his release. At the time, the club faced a backlash from sponsors and fans, prompting them to withdraw their offer to Evans. The PFA has since been working to help Evans find a club where he can continue his football career. The decision to ban Evans from training with Sheffield United is likely to cause further controversy. However, it reflects the deep divisions that exist around the issue of his return to football. While some argue that Evans has the right to attempt to rebuild his career, others feel that his criminal conviction means he should not be allowed to play professional football again.

Householders in Benfleet, Essex, received letters informing them they will no longer receive post.","completion":"Royal Mail has been forced to stop delivering mail to certain households in Benfleet, Essex, due to concerns over uneven road surfaces. According to bosses at the Royal Mail, these surfaces present an 'unacceptable risk' to their postmen, who may fall off their bikes while delivering post. Residents of Benfleet were recently left disappointed and surprised after receiving letters informing them that they will no longer receive post deliveries. The reason behind this decision is understandable, as the safety of the postmen cannot be compromised. Uneven road surfaces can cause injuries, and the Royal Mail cannot take such risks with the safety of its employees. This decision by the Royal Mail highlights the importance of road safety infrastructure. Local authorities must prioritize the development and maintenance of smooth and safe road surfaces, particularly in densely populated areas. Uneven surfaces are not only a danger to pedestrians but also to road users such as cyclists, motorcyclists, and delivery drivers. Moreover, as the Royal Mail delivers to millions of homes and businesses across the UK, it has a responsibility to ensure the safety of its employees. The decision to stop mail deliveries to certain households in Benfleet is not just about protecting the postmen but also about the public perception of the company. If the Royal Mail were to continue delivery services in the area despite the risks, they would be perceived as negligent and irresponsible. To sum up, the decision of the Royal Mail to stop post deliveries to Benfleet households shows why it is imperative for local authorities to maintain safe road surfaces. The safety of all road users, including delivery drivers and postmen, must be considered. The Royal Mail has demonstrated its commitment to safety, and other delivery companies should follow suit by prioritizing safety over other considerations. Ultimately, it is better to put safety first and avoid preventable accidents than to take unnecessary risks and suffer the consequences."},{"prompt":"Myron is making Suzie's claim that dead is better than red.

He is one of the most accurate kickers in the history of the National Football League (NFL) and has scored many points throughout his career. In terms of Gould's total points, it is important to note that kickers primarily score points through field goals and extra point attempts. Field goals are worth three points, while extra points are worth one point. Looking at Gould's career statistics, he has scored a total of 1,725 points as of the end of the 2020 NFL season. This is an impressive feat, considering that he has only played in the league since 2005. In terms of his breakdown of scoring, Gould has made 407 field goals and 504 extra points throughout his career. This means that he has scored a total of 1,323 points through extra points and 1,221 points through field goals. It is important to note that Gould's total points may continue to increase if he decides to continue playing in the NFL. Additionally, if he is able to continue his high level of play, he may break some of the all-time scoring records for NFL kickers. In conclusion, Robbie Gould has scored an impressive 1,725 points throughout his NFL career so far. This is due to his accuracy and consistency when it comes to kicking field goals and extra points. As he continues to play, it will be interesting to see if he can continue to increase his scoring totals and solidify his place among the all-time greats of NFL kickers."},{"prompt":"w does the next paragraph end?

To do this, we will add 90 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 90 = 15m - 90 + 90 Simplifying the equation: 90 = 15m Finally, we can solve for m by dividing both sides of the equation by 15: 90/15 = 15m/15 Simplifying the equation: 6 = m So the solution to the equation 0 = -14m + 29m - 90 is m = 6."},{"prompt":"Continue writing the next sentence.

Witnesses said the gunmen arrived on three-wheel taxis and opened fire on a group of vaccinators, killing at least 10 people. The attack is a further setback to efforts to eradicate polio in Nigeria, which is one of only three countries where the disease is endemic. Religious clerics in the country have been preaching that vaccines would sterilise children and have urged families not to let their children be vaccinated. This has led to a drop in vaccinators visiting some parts of the country, leaving children vulnerable to the disease. The government has been trying to persuade the clerics to back down, but the message is still being spread in some areas. The attack on the vaccination team was clearly designed to disrupt the polio vaccination programme, and comes after threats from Boko Haram that it would target vaccinators. The group has previously carried out attacks on health clinics, and has claimed that polio vaccination is a Western plot to sterilise Muslim children. The use of violence to disrupt vaccination programmes is a worrying trend. It is vital that communities are engaged and convinced of the benefits of vaccination. Health authorities need to work closely with local leaders and clerics to address concerns, and to ensure the safety of vaccinators.

Because they are easy to keep and breed, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have long been the most intensively studied metazoan model organisms, and were among the first lifeforms to be genetically sequenced. This was facilitated by the severely reduced state of their genomes, but as many genes, introns, and linkages lost, these ecdysozoans can teach us little about the origins of animals in general. The extent of this type of evolution within the superphylum will be revealed by the crustacean, annelid, and molluscan genome projects currently in progress. Analysis of the starlet sea anemone genome has emphasised the importance of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates, also being sequenced, in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to the Eumetazoa.

Hollingsworth's comments come as he himself has been sent back to Australia for his own controversial comments about Pearson, which were deemed to be in breach of the team's code of conduct. Despite the distractions, Pearson remains focused on her quest to win gold in Glasgow. She has indicated that she will be relying on her extensive experience to carry her through, saying: \\"I've been doing this for a long time and I know what I need to do to perform at my best. I've got a great team around me and we're all working together to make sure that I'm in the best shape possible.\\" So far, Pearson's performances in Glasgow have been strong, with the hurdler breezing through her heat in the 100m hurdles with a time of 12.69 seconds. She will be looking to build on this success in the final, but will face stiff competition from the likes of Jamaica's Danielle Williams and England's Tiffany Porter. Regardless of the outcome of the final, Pearson's performance in Glasgow will be closely watched by fans and critics alike, as she seeks to cement herself as one of the greats of Australian athletics."},{"prompt":"What is the most logical next event?

For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when a decision was taken to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the buildup of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace.

However, it's also important to consider what we should eat leading up to a fast. Making your meals somewhat lighter in the days leading up to a fast can help prepare your body and mind for the experience. One example of a lighter diet is found in the first Book of Daniel, where the Prophet ate only vegetables, fruit, and water for 10 days. This type of diet is also known as a Daniel Fast, and many people still follow it today as a way to prepare for spiritual or physical challenges. In addition to making your meals lighter, it's important to be mindful of the foods to avoid. There are several agreed-upon foods to avoid during a fast, such as processed foods, refined sugar, and caffeine. These foods can cause spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, leading to feelings of fatigue and hunger. To make sure you're avoiding these foods, it's important to carefully read food labels. Look for hidden sugars and additives, and stick to whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible. This can include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.

When mixed, they create a reaction that can tackle tough stains and odors. Using this powerful combination in your laundry routine can help your clothes come out cleaner and fresher. To create a laundry booster, combine baking soda and hot water in a bowl. Slowly add vinegar to the mixture, stirring as you go. Be careful, as the mixture will fizz and bubble. Once the fizzing has stopped, you can scent the mixture with essential oils or fabric softener, if desired. To use the laundry booster, pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) into your washing machine during the rinse cycle. This will allow the mixture to penetrate the fabric fibers and remove any lingering odors or stains. Be sure to run the rinse cycle as usual, and avoid adding any additional detergent or fabric softener. Not only is this laundry booster effective, but it is also an eco-friendly alternative to traditional laundry products. Baking soda and vinegar are natural cleaners that do not contain any harsh chemicals, making them safe for you, your family, and the environment.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Fungi have long been known for their medicinal and culinary value, but now scientists are exploring their potential as a sustainable source of energy. A recent breakthrough at Montana University has demonstrated that a fungus called Laricifomes officinalis can be used to make biofuel comparable to diesel. This renewable energy source offers a promising alternative to fossil fuels and could play a significant role in combating climate change. Paul Stamets, a prominent mycologist based in the United States, believes that fungi could be used to develop a universal insecticide. This could have substantial benefits for agriculture and pest control, reducing the reliance on harmful chemicals. Additionally, Stamets envisions that mushrooms could play a crucial role in fighting climate change. He argues that fungi’s ability to break down organic material and sequester carbon makes them a valuable tool in the battle against global warming. Eben Bower, CEO of Ecovative, has taken this vision a step further by suggesting that fungi fuel could one day power electric cars. According to Bower, the unique properties of certain fungi make them an ideal material for the construction of car components. By combining this with the biofuel developed at Montana University, the result could be an eco-friendly car that takes advantage of all that fungi has to offer. In conclusion, these developments represent exciting advances in our understanding of fungi and their potential applications. From biofuels to insecticides and even car parts, this versatile organism could revolutionize multiple industries while helping to reduce our carbon footprint. As we continue to explore the possibilities of fungi, we may find that it holds the key to a sustainable and prosperous future."},{"prompt":"gasp How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?

But plants that heard the wind, despite having a similar acoustic sound, knew not to waste their defensive capabilities. This suggests plants are able to identify sounds in their environment. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Plants may have a more advanced form of self-defense than previously thought, according to researchers from the University of Missouri. The team discovered that plants can identify sounds in their environment and respond accordingly. In a study published in the journal Oecologia, the researchers found that the sound of caterpillars eating caused plants to become more defensive. The plants responded by releasing more mustard oils, which are known to be unappealing to caterpillars and can discourage them from feeding on the leaves. Interestingly, the plants were able to differentiate between the sound of caterpillars eating and the sound of the wind, which has a similar acoustic profile. Plants that heard the wind did not waste their defensive capabilities, indicating that they can distinguish between different sounds in their environment. These findings suggest that the ability to respond to sound could be an important part of a plant's defense system. By being able to identify potential threats, such as the sounds of herbivorous insects, plants may be able to mount an effective defense and protect themselves from damage. While previous research has shown that plants can respond to a range of stimuli, including light and temperature, this is the first study to demonstrate that they can respond to sound. The researchers hope that further studies will shed more light on this fascinating aspect of plant biology and help us to better understand the complex interactions between plants and their environment."},{"prompt":"Please answer this question: who has the prime responsibility for environmental protection?","completion":"The prime responsibility for environmental protection varies depending on the jurisdiction, but in general, it is shared by governments, corporations, communities, and individuals."},{"prompt":"Does word push have the same meaning in the following two sentences?
