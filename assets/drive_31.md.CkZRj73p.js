The educational ad shows a mother taking on all the Christmas tasks, from cooking to setting the table, while other family members relax and enjoy themselves. While some have applauded the ad's realism, others find it sexist and emblematic of outdated gender roles. The ad has elicited intense reactions, with the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) receiving 620 complaints. Despite the negative feedback, the ASA has stated that the ad is not sexist and reflects everyday life. Numerous households are still led by women who bear the brunt of domestic duties, especially during the holidays. The ad simply demonstrates this reality, according to the ASA. The ASA's ruling has been met with mixed reactions. While many agree that the ad is indeed reflective of the gender roles that persist, some believe that it reinforces these roles and is therefore inappropriate. Opponents argue that the ad feeds into the oppressive narrative that women are solely responsible for domestic work, despite advances in gender equality. Asda, for its part, has stood by its advertisement, stating that they wanted to showcase the \\"mountain of work\\" that mothers typically endure during the holiday season. The ad was intended to honor English mothers, who frequently take on the lion's share of holiday preparation and planning.

If they're particularly busy or have an important deadline approaching, it may not be the best time to approach them with your request. Try to choose a time when they're likely to be available and have the mental space to give your conversation their full attention. Once you've found a convenient time, make sure you're concise in your explanation.

Consider summarizing your key points in advance so that you can present them quickly and efficiently. Finally, don't leave it too long to bring up your topic of discussion. If you wait too long, your boss may assume that it's not important or that you've forgotten about it altogether.

At the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics. But they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation and the notion of class. Please answer a question about this article.

The internet and its related technologies have given people countless tools to engage with others in new and exciting ways. Unfortunately, some individuals choose to use these tools to harass, insult, or embarrass others, leading to incidents of cyber-bullying. It's unacceptable to try and put someone down based on your superiority complex or to make yourself feel better. It's important to teach your kids that creating websites or message boards for the sole purpose of upsetting, embarrassing, or talking badly about another person is a form of cyber-bullying. They should understand that such activities can be detrimental to their mental and emotional health as well as the person they're targeting. Remind them that the victim may have to deal with the negative consequences for a long time, and it's never worth making someone else's life miserable. In addition, make sure your children know that cyber-bullies may assume others' identities. They might use fake accounts on social media, forums, or other sites to hide their true identity while they harass or threaten someone else. Teach them to be cautious about trusting strangers online and heavily emphasize the importance of privacy settings on social media accounts. They must know that they should never share personal information with anyone they don't know or trust online. Children should also learn the importance of respecting others and treating people the way they would want to be treated. It's necessary to have an open conversation with them about how their actions affect others and emphasize the fact that their words can be as hurtful as physical actions. They should understand that cyber-bullying is a form of harassment and that they can face the legal consequences if caught. Above all, they should know that cyber-bullying is not acceptable and must be reported immediately."},{"prompt":"Based on the premise If he had to use too much force, it would almost certainly creak., can we conclude the hypothesis It would most probably make a noise if he had to use too much force. is true?

Bend the tips of the wings up. Crease the back of the ship to create a spoiler.","completion":"Building a spaceship from paper is an enjoyable and creative activity for anyone interested in science fiction or imaginative play. With just a few folds and creases, an ordinary sheet of paper can easily transform into a spaceship that will take you soaring through the stars. Here are some simple steps to fold the edges of the top-most piece to make the windows of the spaceship. To begin, place your piece of paper on a flat surface with the coloured side down. Fold the paper in half vertically, bringing the left edge over to meet the right edge. Unfold the paper, and then fold it in half horizontally. Next, fold the top-left and top-right corners of the paper towards the centre crease, creating two diagonal folds. Bring the two folded edges together to make a triangle, then fold the triangle in half vertically, bringing the bottom point of the triangle up to meet the top point. Now it's time to create the windows of your spaceship. Take the top layer of paper and fold it down towards the bottom edge about a third of the way down. Then, fold it back up towards the top along the same crease to create a new crease line. Repeat this process for the left and right sides of the paper, bringing each edge down and then back up to create three evenly spaced creases. With the folds complete, carefully open up the paper, revealing three diamond-shaped windows. To make the wings of your spaceship, bend the tips of the paper upwards, tucking them slightly behind the windows. For added stability, you can fold each wing in half diagonally so that the tips of the wings point downwards towards the back of the ship. Finally, to create a spoiler for your spaceship, fold down the back edge of the paper slightly along the centre crease, creating a slight crease. Then, fold each side of the paper, bringing the edges inwards towards the centre. Unfold the sides, and then tuck each one into the pocket created by the crease you made earlier. With those simple steps, your paper spaceship is now ready to take off into the stars. You can fly it around your room or use your imagination to explore the far reaches of the universe.

To determine which player scored the final points of a game, there are a few steps that must be taken. The first is to identify the sport in question. Different sports have different rules and scoring systems, and therefore, the process of determining the final points will vary. For instance, in basketball, the final points are determined by the team with the highest score at the end of the game. The player who made the last basket or free throw may have contributed to the final score, but they are not necessarily the player who scored the final points. In football, the final points are determined by the team with the most points at the end of the game. This can be achieved through touchdowns, field goals, and extra points. In this case, the player who scored the final points may be the player who scored the last touchdown or kicked the last field goal or extra point. In soccer, the final points are determined by the team with the most goals at the end of the game. The player who scored the final points is typically the player who scored the last goal of the game. In conclusion, to determine which player scored the final points of a game, it is important to identify the sport in question and understand its specific rules and scoring system.

Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity.:61–65 Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles.

It could be a sports team, a painting club, a cooking group, or any other activity that brings us joy. By doing something we love, we automatically connect with like-minded people and have a common ground to start a conversation. Secondly, volunteering with a charitable organization not only helps a good cause, but it also allows us to meet new people in a new setting. By working alongside others who share our values and goals, we build trust and a bond that can lead to long-lasting friendships. Lastly, something as simple as befriending our neighbor or co-worker can go a long way. Often, we spend more time with our colleagues than our friends, and building a healthy relationship with them can improve our work environment and well-being. Similarly, saying hi or inviting our neighbors over for dinner can build a sense of community and make us feel more connected to our neighborhood.

Drying your hydrangeas is a great option that will allow you to enjoy them for months to come. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started. 1. Prepare the flowers for drying The first step is to choose the flowers you want to dry. Hydrangea blooms should be cut from the plant when they are just beginning to show color but are still tight and firm. Remove any leaves from the stem and cut the stems to your desired length. 2. Prepare the drying container For drying your hydrangeas, you'll need a container that is airtight and has enough room for the blooms to be evenly spaced. You can use a plastic container or a cardboard box, but make sure it has a tight-fitting lid. 3. Place the blooms in the container The next step is to place the hydrangea blooms in the container. Make sure they are evenly spaced and not touching each other. This will ensure they dry evenly and don't stick together. 4. Add more silica gel Silica gel is a desiccant that will absorb moisture from the flowers and speed up the drying process. Add enough silica gel to cover the bottom of the container, then gently pour more silica gel over the blooms until they are covered. 5. Start the drying process Once your blooms are covered in silica gel, seal the container tightly and leave it in a dry, warm place. Check on the blooms after a few days to see how they are drying. Depending on the moisture content and humidity in your area, it may take up to two weeks for the flowers to dry completely. 6. Remove the blooms from the container When the flowers are fully dry, gently remove them from the silica gel using a soft brush or a pair of tweezers. Be sure to handle them carefully, as they will be fragile and delicate. 7. Store or display the dried hydrangeas Now that your hydrangeas are dry, you can store them in an airtight container until you're ready to use them, or display them in a vase or a wreath. Dried hydrangeas make a beautiful and long-lasting addition to any floral arrangement. In summary, drying your hydrangeas is a simple and effective way to preserve their beauty. With a little bit of patience and the right materials, you can enjoy your hydrangeas all year round."},{"prompt":"Same meaning?

For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just that portion of the envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064.

They gave up an average of 9.7 points in the first quarter of their games. This statistic is undoubtedly concerning for the Cowboys and their fans because it sets them back early in games and makes it challenging for them to come from behind. To make matters worse, the Cowboys struggled defensively throughout the entire game, giving up an average of 29.6 points per contest, which was the fifth-worst mark in the league. The culprit for the Cowboys' struggles on defense last season was a combination of factors, including injuries, poor coaching, and lack of execution. Their secondary was decimated by injuries, which left them vulnerable to big plays in the passing game. Additionally, their defensive coordinator, Mike Nolan, who was in his first year on the job, struggled to get his players to buy into his system, which contributed to their overall lack of production. Moving forward, the Cowboys will need to make significant changes if they hope to compete at a high level. They have already made some moves in the offseason, most notably hiring Dan Quinn as their new defensive coordinator. Quinn has a proven track record of success in the NFL, having coached the dominant Seattle Seahawks defense during their Super Bowl runs in the early 2010s. If he can get the Cowboys' defense to play at even an average level, it will go a long way towards helping the team win more games in 2021 and beyond."},{"prompt":"Write a positive yelp review.","completion":"\\"Amazing experience!

He reminisces about his time there, talking about the energy and camaraderie that comes with working in a restaurant kitchen. But as he walks along the shoreline, he also notes the stark contrast between the idyllic beauty of Cape Cod and the harsh realities of addiction.

For example, in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook crossborder surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals. A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by Prussian police of Karl Marx during the years he remained resident in London.

Sam was cut by the Rams on Saturday, leaving his NFL future in question. However, it appears that the Cowboys are happy to give him a chance to prove himself. Taking to the practice field in Irving wearing his new No. 46 jersey, Sam looked comfortable with his new teammates, displaying his strength and agility for the coaches. Head coach Jason Garrett appears to be encouraged by what he has seen so far from the 6-foot-2, 260-pound defensive end.

It is no secret that Sam has been a controversial player, having come out as gay earlier this year. However, the Cowboys seem willing to give him the chance he deserves. This is not the first time that the franchise has taken a chance on a player, having signed former Dallas Mavericks basketball player, Eduardo Najera, in 2002.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. The first and last Roman known as a living divus was Julius Caesar, who seems to have aspired to divine monarchy; he was murdered soon after.

By the end of his reign, Augustus had appropriated Rome's political apparatus – and most of its religious cults – within his reformed and thoroughly integrated system of government. Towards the end of his life, he cautiously allowed cult to his numen. By then the Imperial cult apparatus was fully developed, first in the Eastern Provinces, then in the West. Provincial Cult centres offered the amenities and opportunities of a major Roman town within a local context; bathhouses, shrines and temples to Roman and local deities, amphitheatres and festivals.

Part of alpaca's herd instinct to protect youngsters and chase predators off.","completion":"In Berkshire, a group of 10 spring lambs are under the watchful eye of some unlikely guardians - a herd of South American alpacas. Despite being only 5ft tall, these gentle animals are fiercely protective of their young charges and have taken it upon themselves to ward off any potential predators. It may seem surprising that these fluffy creatures from the Andes would be tasked with protecting lambs in rural England, but it actually makes perfect sense. Alpacas are known for their strong herd instinct, and part of that instinct is to protect the young from harm. In fact, when confronted with a perceived threat, alpacas will not hesitate to use their powerful legs and sharp teeth to fend off predators. This makes them particularly effective at keeping foxes and other small predators at bay, which is essential for farmers looking to protect their flocks. But these guardians aren't just effective - they're also incredibly cute. With their soft, fluffy coats and gentle demeanour, the alpacas have become a hit with visitors to the farm where they reside. And while they may not be the most conventional protectors, they certainly get the job done. So if you ever find yourself wandering through the fields of Berkshire and come across a group of lambs being watched over by some furry, 5ft-tall guardians, rest assured that they're in good hands (or paws, as the case may be). The alpacas may be small, but they're definitely mighty when it comes to protecting their charges."},{"prompt":"@Vince_Craine Glad to see you've toned down your sell.

This year’s exercise involves a massive array of 40 ships, showcasing the scale and complexity of the drill. One of the participating countries, China, marks its first-ever involvement in the world’s largest naval exercise. Despite this, concerns have arisen over China’s involvement, given the presence of spy ships that the country has deployed to observe other nations.

The advertisement, created by show creator Matthew Weiner, features an image of a man falling from a high-rise building. Critics have called the image \\"cruel\\" and \\"tasteless,\\" with some saying it is reminiscent of the \\"Falling Man\\" photograph taken during the September 11, 2001 attacks. The billboard was displayed all over Manhattan, including in areas close to Ground Zero. As a result, some New Yorkers found the image offensive and insensitive. The use of the image has sparked a debate about the appropriateness of using sensitive images in advertising, particularly in a city still coping with the trauma of the 9/11 attacks. Weiner has defended the billboard, stating that the image is meant to reflect the show's theme of change and transformation. According to the show creator, the man in the image represents the show's protagonist, Don Draper, who has gone through a similar transformation throughout the course of the series. Despite Weiner's explanation, some critics believe that the use of the image was a misstep. The controversy has highlighted the importance of sensitivity in advertising, particularly when it comes to images related to national tragedies. While advertising is often intended to be provocative, it is important for advertisers to consider the potential impact their images may have on viewers.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. In 1926 Joseph P. Maxwell and Henry C. Harrison from Bell Telephone Laboratories disclosed that the recording pattern of the Western Electric rubber line magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic. This meant that as frequency increased in the treble, recording amplitude decreased. Conversely, in the bass as frequency decreased, recording amplitude increased. Therefore, it was necessary to attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250 Hz, the bass turnover point, in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head. Otherwise, bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove. When played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region, a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary. G. H. Miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records, the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form.

Build the name. Recognize and name transition metals.","completion":"This article will provide a comprehensive guide on understanding ionic compounds and naming conventions for transition metals. Ionic compounds are formed when ions with opposite charges attract and combine with each other. This means that an atom that loses an electron to become positively charged (cation) will combine with an atom that gains an electron to become negatively charged (anion). To identify and name an ionic compound, it is important to understand what makes a compound ionic. Ionic compounds are composed of a metal cation and a non-metal anion. For example, Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound because Sodium (Na) is a metal cation and Chloride (Cl) is a non-metal anion. Ionic compounds are named using the Stock system, which involves the use of roman numerals to identify the charge of the metal cation. Transition metals, such as Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (Zn), have variable charges, which means that they can form different cations with different charges. To name transition metals, you must first determine their charge. This can be done by either looking at the charge on the anion or by using the charge balance rule. The charge balance rule states that the net charge of an ionic compound must be zero. For example, Iron (Fe) can form cations with a charge of +2 and +3. If Iron combines with Chloride (Cl) which is an anion with a charge of -1, then the net charge of the compound must be zero, which means we need two Chloride ions for every Iron ion with a charge of +2 or three Chloride ions for every Iron ion with a charge of +3. The name of the compound is written by first writing the name of the metal cation, followed by the roman numeral that represents the charge on the ion in parentheses, and then the name of the non-metal anion. For example, the compound formed when Fe combines with Cl is named Iron(II) Chloride (FeCl2) for the cation with a charge of +2 and Iron(III) Chloride (FeCl3) for the cation with a charge of +3. In conclusion, understanding the characteristics of ionic compounds, and transition metals' charge can help you name them correctly. By using the Stock system and charge balance rule, you can accurately name ionic compounds, allowing you to communicate your findings effectively."},{"prompt":"Sentence: This oven bakes potatoes well.

Japan, one of the countries invested in the F-35 program, has ordered 42 of the single-engine stealth jets. This is a significant investment, and the grounding of these jets may have an impact on their military capabilities. Grounding the F-35s is necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of these jets. As costly as the program may be, it is important to prioritize safety over financial concerns.

Bars can get busy and the bartenders may be working hard to keep up with orders. Don't get frustrated if your drink takes a little longer to arrive than expected. Also, make sure you order your drinks the right way. Different regions have different names for popular drinks, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the local terminology. Additionally, it's always best to stick to simpler drinks, as bartenders may not be able to make more complex cocktails. Another important rule is to never ask for drinks after the bar has closed. Bartenders have been working hard all night and are likely ready to go home. If you come across as demanding or disrespectful, it can create a negative experience for everyone. Speaking of respect, always approach the bar with a positive attitude and treat the bartenders with respect. This means refraining from any inappropriate or aggressive behavior. Finally, it's essential to know how to tip properly when you travel. While tipping customs vary depending on the region, it's generally a good idea to leave 15-20% of the total bill for good service.

Sadly, the babies were not properly restrained in their car seats, which appeared to be too big for them. The accident highlights the importance of proper child safety seat use and installation. Car accidents are the leading cause of death for young children, making it crucial for parents to ensure their children are properly restrained in car seats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants be placed in rear-facing car seats until they are at least two years old or until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by their car seat manufacturer. It is also important to note that not all car seats are the same, and it is essential to choose the appropriate car seat based on the child’s weight, height, and age. Installing the car seat correctly is just as important as choosing the right one. Many car seat manufacturers offer installation videos or in-person installation assistance to ensure proper installation. Parents should also ensure that their child’s car seat is not too big, particularly for infants. Car seats are designed to fit specific weight and height ranges and should be chosen accordingly. If a car seat is too big, it may not provide the necessary support and protection in the event of an accident. This tragic accident serves as a reminder of the importance of proper child safety seat use and installation. It is every parent’s responsibility to ensure that their children are properly restrained in car seats every time they ride in a vehicle.
