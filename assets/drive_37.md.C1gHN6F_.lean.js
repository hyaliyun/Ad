All seven of the Toffees' corners at the Etihad were poorly executed, failing to give their team any advantage. Manager Roberto Martinez had admitted that he prefers to score from open play, and some fans and critics alike believe that his neglect of set pieces may have cost Everton the match. While it's true that set pieces are not the be-all and end-all of football, they can make a significant difference in a game such as this one. Unfortunately for Everton, their lack of prowess in set pieces was not the only issue they faced. Defender Phil Jagielka's challenge on James Milner led to a penalty, allowing City to take the lead and snatch the win from Everton. It's clear that Everton will need to work on their set-piece strategies if they hope to compete at the highest level. While Martinez's focus on open play is admirable, it's important to remember that a well-executed set piece can be just as effective in scoring goals and winning games."},{"prompt":"Melbourne Melbourne universities have campuses all over Australia and some internationally.

American eggs are kept refrigerated for safety reasons, whereas UK eggs are stored at room temperature.","completion":"Eggs are a staple food around the world and are consumed in many different ways. However, there are significant differences in how eggs are regulated and treated in different countries. For example, eggs in the UK would be illegal in the US because they are not cleaned, and American eggs don't comply with UK laws because they are cleaned. In the UK, eggs are not washed or cleaned before they reach the supermarket shelves. This is because the eggs have a protective layer called a bloom or cuticle that prevents bacteria from entering the egg. Cleaning or washing the egg could damage this protective layer and increase the risk of bacterial contamination. Therefore, UK eggs are stored at room temperature and do not require refrigeration. On the other hand, American eggs are washed and treated with chemicals to remove any dirt or bacteria that may be present on the eggshell. This removes the protective cuticle, which means the eggs are more vulnerable to contamination. To compensate for this, American eggs must be refrigerated at all times to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. These differences in regulation and treatment of eggs are due to variations in food safety laws and cultural preferences. However, it does raise the question of which approach is safer. While there is no clear answer, both the US and UK have low rates of egg-related illnesses, suggesting that both approaches are effective. In conclusion, eggs are an essential part of the global diet, but their regulation and treatment can vary significantly between countries. Therefore, it is important to be aware of these differences when cooking and consuming eggs in different parts of the world."},{"prompt":"During the 16th and 17th centuries slave traders began to raid the region as part of the expansion of the Saharan and Nile River slave routes.

His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832.

In recent weeks, candidates have been defending America's failed Cuba policy, making themselves look quite silly in the process. It seems that only candidate Ron Paul has the right idea about Cuba. For decades, American policy toward Cuba has been to isolate and punish the island nation. This policy has been a complete failure, accomplishing nothing but keeping the Cuban people in poverty and under the thumb of the Castro regime. Despite this, many candidates for the Republican nomination seem determined to cling to this outmoded approach. Ron Paul, however, has consistently spoken out against America's failed Cuba policy. He argues that the best way to bring about change in Cuba is through engagement, not isolation. By opening up trade and travel with Cuba, the United States can foster greater economic ties and provide an alternative model to the Castro regime. It is unfortunate that other candidates have failed to see the wisdom of Ron Paul's approach.

Attach boards with 2.5 inch (6.3 cm) Kreg screws. Sand the surface. Cut the breadboard ends. Attach the breadboard ends.","completion":"Building a Perfect Tabletop: A Step-by-Step Guide To build a quality tabletop, you need to follow precise instructions. Here's how to go about it: 1. Cut the Lumber for the Tabletop: Start by cutting your lumber into desired sizes. Arrange the boards on a flat surface to fit snugly together without gaps. 2. Mark the Pocket Hole Locations: Once you have arranged the boards, mark the locations where you want to drill pocket holes. Make sure that you mark them on the bottom side of the tabletop and along the joints of each board. 3. Adjust the Kreg Jig Depth: Set your Kreg Jig to the correct depth, depending on the thickness of the boards you're using. This will ensure that you create a strong joint. 4. Adjust the Jig Placement & Drill the Pocket Holes: Position the Kreg Jig on the marked spots on the boards and drill pocket holes. Ensure that you make the pocket holes in opposite directions to prevent the lumber from splitting. 5. Lay Out the Boards & Attach with Screws: Arrange the boards in a pattern you like, and then attach them using 2.5-inch Kreg screws. Work your way from the center outwards, so you don't end up with any bowing or warping. 6. Sand the Surface: Sand your tabletop surface, starting with coarse sandpaper to remove any rough spots, and then move on to fine sandpaper until you achieve a smooth surface. 7. Cut the Breadboard Ends: Cut the breadboard ends to the desired length, making sure that they fit flush with the tabletop's ends. 8. Attach the Breadboard Ends: Secure the breadboard ends using your Kreg Jig and screws. This will give your tabletop a polished look, and also help prevent the boards from expanding or contracting too much. In conclusion, building a perfect tabletop is easy if you follow these simple steps. Remember to take your time and follow each step carefully to ensure that your tabletop is both sturdy and aesthetically pleasing."},{"prompt":"Answer a question about this article: For the first several decades of disc record manufacturing, sound was recorded directly on to the master disc at the recording studio. From about 1950 on (earlier for some large record companies, later for some small ones) it became usual to have the performance first recorded on audio tape, which could then be processed and/or edited, and then dubbed on to the master disc. A record cutter would engrave the grooves into the master disc. Early versions of these master discs were soft wax, and later a harder lacquer was used.

Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 11 of its major languages official status), which was seen by them as a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation. Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system. Some other languages have received semiofficial recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. It is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools, and English language is a compulsory subject. As in other postcolonial African societies, the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school dropouts and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low.

The elderly woman was lowered into a scalding bath, leading to her death. Yesterday, the care home was fined just £5,000 at Flintshire Magistrates. The court was informed that the home had no effective control over water temperature, which could have been as high as 50C, while the safe level is 44C. The company that owned this care home is now in liquidation with no assets. The judge presiding over the case remarked that it was unlikely that the fine imposed would ever be collected. This appalling incident has once again highlighted the carelessness of some care homes, where the vulnerable elderly are placed in the hands of poorly trained, understaffed and underfunded facilities. This has renewed the conversation on how we can provide quality care and ensure the safety of our elderly population, especially those residing in care homes. Regulators must tighten regulations to ensure that care homes are held accountable for their actions, and those who break the rules should face severe penalties. There should be a thorough investigation into the care homes' practices before they are permitted to operate. Furthermore, the government must invest in more resources and provide stricter guidance to care homes on how to maintain the safety and well-being of their residents. It is important to remember that the elderly in our society should be cherished and looked after with the utmost respect and care, and not treated as dispensable objects. In conclusion, the death of Beatrice Morgan is a tragedy that could have been prevented. The inadequacies of this care home were shocking and the fine imposed upon it negligible. Let us hope that regulators and policymakers take swift action to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future."},{"prompt":"did n't matter how much time she did spend with Severus , she still wanted more .

Early 20th century critics such as Ezra Pound, T. E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental slop (Hulme)[citation needed] or an old bitch gone in the teeth (Pound) and wanted to go back to a more manly, authoritarian society such as (they believed) existed in the Middle Ages. Postmodern critics who are selfdescribed antihumanists, such as JeanFrançois Lyotard and Michel Foucault, have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature, which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal, suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger).

The film falters in nearly every aspect. From the confusing storyline to the incredibly creepy and unappealing character designs, it's hard to find anything positive to say about this movie. The CGI work is poorly executed, making the actors look more like strange, anthropomorphic humanoids rather than graceful feline creatures. The music is equally as forgettable, with none of the songs sticking out as particularly memorable or well-composed. The entire movie feels like a surreal fever dream, and not in a good way. The pacing is slow and plodding, with no real sense of direction or momentum. Even the talented cast, including Judy Dench, Ian McKellen, and Jennifer Hudson, can't save this movie from being an utter disaster. In fact, some of their performances are downright cringe-worthy, with awkward cat-like movements and exaggerated facial expressions that border on parody. Overall, Cats is a misfire of epic proportions.

Chris Taylor, 23, to prove condition won’t hold him back. Heartshock device under his skin similar to footballer Fabrice Muamba.","completion":"Chris Taylor, a 23-year-old runner, is about to embark on a truly unique marathon attempt despite a serious health risk. He plans to prove that his condition will not hold him back, and will run a marathon with a heart-shock device similar to that of footballer Fabrice Muamba installed under his skin. A heart-shock device, also known as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), is a small device inserted under the skin near the collarbone. The device is designed to detect and correct potentially dangerous heart rhythms. Muamba’s career in football was cut short after he collapsed due to a cardiac arrest during a match. The event prompted him to have an ICD fitted, as would be the case with Taylor. Taylor, who has a hereditary heart condition, will attempt to run the Manchester Marathon with his ICD. While he is aware of the risk involved, he is determined to go ahead with his plan. His aim is to show that living with heart disease does not mean a life without exercise or physical exertion. It is not uncommon for people with heart conditions to avoid rigorous physical activity. But as Taylor puts it, “I want to inspire others with heart conditions to show them that they can do something they want to do. Even with my condition, I’ve decided that there is no reason why I can’t attempt a marathon. I just have to take precautions, listen to my body, and adjust my pace as necessary.” The fact that Taylor is willing to take on such a challenge despite his health risks is admirable. It’s refreshing to see someone not let their condition define them or hold them back. It may serve as an inspiration to others with similar conditions to take calculated risks and challenge themselves to go beyond what they thought was possible. In conclusion, Taylor’s marathon attempt is not only unique but also brave. He is a true inspiration to others with hereditary heart conditions, and his story serves as a reminder that with the right mindset, anything is possible. It’s important for people with heart conditions to consult with their doctors before engaging in physical activities, and to take on tasks that are safe and feasible."},{"prompt":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","completion":"Sentence: The cat sat on the windowsill in the sunlight.

Moussavi was known for his efforts to modernize and develop the country's infrastructure, industries, and institutions. His policies helped to build a strong foundation for the country's economic growth and development. However, Moussavi's hardline stance on Iran's nuclear program put him at odds with the international community. He vehemently opposed any move to suspend the country's enrichment program, insisting that it was essential for Iran's energy security and sovereignty. Despite his past accomplishments, Moussavi has been absent from politics for the past 10 years. His absence has been attributed to his involvement in the 2009 Iranian presidential elections, marred by allegations of fraud and rigging.

This will induce an additional current in the antenna element, changing the current at the feedpoint for a given feedpoint voltage. Thus the antenna's impedance, given by the ratio of feedpoint voltage to current, is altered due to the antenna's proximity to the ground. This can be quite a significant effect when the antenna is within a wavelength or two of the ground. But as the antenna height is increased, the reduced power of the reflected wave (due to the inverse square law) allows the antenna to approach its asymptotic feedpoint impedance given by theory. At lower heights, the effect on the antenna's impedance is very sensitive to the exact distance from the ground, as this affects the phase of the reflected wave relative to the currents in the antenna. Changing the antenna's height by a quarter wavelength, then changes the phase of the reflection by 180°, with a completely different effect on the antenna's impedance.

Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck is where the most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier – for example, the fact that it is a ship means that a fulllength runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects takeoff procedure, as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced takeoff load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself.

Try to be the first one to end the conversation.","completion":"When it comes to texting someone you're interested in, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, don't feel like you need to wait a certain amount of time before responding. While it's important to not come on too strong, waiting too long can give the impression that you're not interested. Another tip is to avoid using a lot of slang in your texts. While it may seem like a good way to come across as casual and cool, it can actually be off-putting and make it hard for the other person to understand what you're saying. Instead, try to keep your texts lighthearted, especially at first. It's also important not to overthink it. Texting is meant to be a casual form of communication, so don't stress too much about coming across perfectly. And while it's great to be responsive, try not to text the other person way more than they text you. This can make you come across as clingy or desperate. Finally, try to be the first one to end the conversation. This shows that you're respectful of the other person's time and that you're not expecting them to be available to text all day long.

The crisis began on January 16, 2013, when militants linked to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) attacked a gas facility near In Amenas in eastern Algeria. The militants took hundreds of workers hostage, including 132 foreign nationals from over 20 countries. The hostage takers demanded the release of Islamist prisoners and an end to French intervention in Mali. The Algerian government refused to negotiate with the militants and instead launched a military operation to end the crisis. After a four-day siege, the military stormed the facility, resulting in the deaths of 38 hostages and 29 militants. While there have been other high-profile hostage situations involving tourists and resort workers, such as the 2002 Bali bombings and the 2015 attack on the Sousse beach resort in Tunisia, the number of hostages in those situations was significantly lower.

However, her meeting with then-Prime Minister David Cameron proved to be awkward. The visit was meant to strengthen UK-German relations, but instead, tensions rose. When Merkel arrived at No 10 Downing Street, there was a sense of unease in the air. As soon as the two leaders shook hands, it was clear that there was something wrong. Reports suggest that Cameron was frustrated with Merkel's handling of the Eurozone crisis and was hoping for more support from Germany. Merkel, on the other hand, had her own domestic issues to deal with and reportedly found Cameron's demands difficult to manage. The meeting was brief and uncomfortable, with both leaders appearing anxious to get it over with. While they posed for photographs outside No 10, the body language between them was tense. The awkwardness of the meeting was visible to everyone in attendance. After the meeting, there was little indication that any progress had been made in UK-German relations.

Even after cutting thousands of jobs, increasing taxes, and reducing pensions for public workers, the city still owes more than 18 billion, and its future is uncertain. One potential source of revenue that officials have considered is selling assets owned by the city, including the art collection housed in the Detroit Institute of Arts. The DIA's collection is home to over 60,000 works of art, including priceless masterpieces from some of the world's most renowned artists. However, the city's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, has asked for a detailed inventory of the art to assess its value, causing an outcry from many who are worried about its possible sale. Local residents and art enthusiasts have rallied to the defense of the museum, arguing that selling off the collection would be a short-sighted solution that could irreparably harm Detroit's cultural heritage. Many have also voiced concerns about the potential loss of jobs if the museum were to close or significantly scale back its operations. Despite the concerns raised by many, a spokesman for the emergency manager has issued a statement saying that a sale of the art collection is not currently being planned. However, the possibility of selling the collection remains a topic of discussion among city officials, leaving many to wonder about the fate of Detroit's cultural treasures. In the end, the fate of the art collection in the Detroit Institute of Arts remains uncertain. Although officials have denied plans to sell it, the ongoing budget crisis in the city means that all options must be considered.

Look for curlers that have replaceable pads, so you can easily swap them out when they become worn or dirty. When using your eyelash curler, make sure to position it as close to the base of your lashes as possible. Gently clamp down and hold for a few seconds before releasing. For an extra boost, heat your curler gently with a hairdryer before using – just make sure it's not too hot!

If humans can only exist for about a hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them.

To ensure that your gardenia plants thrive, it is essential to plant them correctly and provide them with the proper care. Here are some steps that you can follow to plant and care for your gardenia plants. 1. Water the spot where you're planting the gardenia: Before planting your gardenia, it is crucial to water the soil thoroughly. This will help the plant establish strong roots and ensure that it receives the necessary moisture to thrive. 2. Dig a hole as deep as the root ball of the gardenia and twice as wide: The hole for your gardenia should be dug as deep as the root ball of the plant and twice as wide. This will ensure that the plant has enough room to grow and establish strong roots. 3. Set the gardenia in the hole: Place the gardenia in the hole and gently press the soil around the plant's base. Make sure that the plant sits at the same depth it was in the container or ground. 4. Mulch around the gardenia's base: Mulching around the base of your gardenia will help keep the soil moist and cool. Apply a layer of mulch, such as bark, wood chips, or pine needles, around 2-3 inches thick, but not touching the plant's base. 5. Keep the gardenia watered: Gardenias need to be kept moist but not waterlogged. Water your gardenia deeply, but infrequently to promote root growth. Water your gardenia when the top few inches of soil are dry. 6. Fertilize once a month during spring and summer: Fertilize your gardenia once a month with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season. This will help provide the plant with the necessary nutrients to produce healthy foliage and flowers. 7. Prune the gardenia: Pruning your gardenia will help it maintain shape and promote healthy growth. Prune your gardenia after it has finished blooming by removing any dead or diseased wood. 8. Look for signs of pest infestation: Gardenias are prone to pest infestations, such as whiteflies or mealybugs. Look for signs of pest infestation, such as yellowing leaves or sticky residue on the leaves, and treat with a horticultural oil or insecticidal soap. By following these simple steps, you can help ensure that your gardenia plants thrive and produce beautiful blooms for years to come."},{"prompt":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: front, palace, statue","completion":"The front of the palace features a magnificent statue."},{"prompt":"The explosion, while killing one of the Cossacks and seriously wounding the driver and people on the sidewalk, had only damaged the bulletproof carriage, a gift from Napoleon III of France.

One of the best ways to cook a steak is by using a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. To begin with, make sure to coat the skillet with a high-heat oil to prevent the steak from sticking. It is recommended to cook one steak at a time to ensure that the heat is distributed evenly. Once you have placed the steak on the skillet, let it cook for about 4-6 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the steak. To flip the steak over, use tongs or a fork, and avoid using a spatula as it can pierce the steak and cause the juices to escape. After cooking on both sides, you can lower the heat and finish cooking the steak to your desired doneness. This is especially important if you want a medium or well-done steak. By lowering the heat, the steak can cook evenly, allowing the flavors to develop perfectly. In conclusion, cooking a steak in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat is a great way to achieve a perfectly cooked steak with a crispy exterior and juicy interior.

For nearly 2000 years, Sanskrit was the language of a cultural order that exerted influence across South Asia, Inner Asia, Southeast Asia, and to a certain extent East Asia. A significant form of postVedic Sanskrit is found in the Sanskrit of Indian epic poetry—the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The deviations from Pāṇini in the epics are generally considered to be on account of interference from Prakrits, or innovations, and not because they are prePaninian.

Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field.

This means that if the team kicks a field goal on their first possession, we can expect them to gain around 36 yards. On the other hand, the length of a touchdown can vary greatly depending on the play. A short run or pass could result in a touchdown as short as 1-2 yards, while a long bomb could result in a touchdown of 50 yards or more. However, the average touchdown length in the NFL is around 20 yards. So, if the team scores a touchdown on their first possession, we can expect them to gain around 20 yards. Adding these two figures together, we get a total of approximately 56 yards gained. Again, it's important to remember that this is just an average and the actual number could be higher or lower depending on the specific game.

Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone).

In addition to using the right hair care products, it's important to take care of your hair by avoiding heat as much as possible. High temperatures can damage your hair and lead to breakage and split ends. Try to air dry your hair whenever possible and avoid using hot tools such as hair dryers, straighteners, and curling irons. Regular haircuts are also crucial for keeping your hair healthy. Trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to prevent split ends and promote healthy growth. This will also help to maintain the shape of your hairstyle and prevent it from becoming dull and lifeless. While it's important to take care of your hair, it's also important to embrace your hair's natural style. Rather than trying to force your hair into a certain style or texture, work with what you have and try to enhance it. This will not only make your hair look its best, but it will also be easier to maintain. Finally, a balanced diet can also contribute to healthy hair. Make sure to eat a diet that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein, as these nutrients are essential for healthy hair growth. Drinking plenty of water can also help to keep your hair hydrated and looking its best. In conclusion, taking care of your hair may require some effort, but the results are worth it. By finding the right hair care products, avoiding heat, getting regular haircuts, embracing your hair's natural style, and eating a balanced diet, you can achieve beautiful, healthy hair that looks and feels amazing."},{"prompt":"Apple UK has confirmed the company will be selling its most unusual recent product iPod Socks in the UK.

To do this, simply divide the numerator by the denominator, and the resulting number is the decimal equivalent of the fraction.

To do this, divide both the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number. This will produce a fraction with the same value but different numerator and denominator. Finding equivalent fractions can be helpful when adding or subtracting fractions, as it allows for easier manipulation. Reducing fractions to their lowest terms is also important when working with fractions. To do this, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor.

Reducing fractions to their lowest terms is particularly helpful when working with larger numbers, as it allows for simpler arithmetic operations and easier comparison of fractions.

For one thing, getting around becomes a nightmare, which is especially true when your Sat Nav decides to stop working. It's frustrating and can sometimes leave us feeling helpless. But, Sat Navs aren't the only thing we rely on these days. In fact, sometimes, it's the little things that can cause the most problems. Like, for instance, losing your false teeth. It's not something we want to admit, but as we age, our memory can start to fail us. And, if you're someone who wears dentures, losing them can be a real problem. So, what do you do when you can't find your false teeth? The best thing to do is to retrace your steps and think about where you might have left them. Moving on to another common problem, what happens when you need to go out of town and bring your furry friend with you? But, what happens when you can't take your dog with you and need a dog-minder? Fortunately, there are several options available today, from professional dog-sitters to boarding kennels. These services can give you peace of mind and ensure that your dog is well looked after while you're away. Finally, the weather is always a topic of conversation, and for a good reason. The weather can dictate how we plan our day and often affects our mood. Checking the weather forecast has never been easier thanks to modern technology, but what happens when you need to know the weather on the go? There are several apps available, such as Weather Pro and AccuWeather, which can provide up-to-minute updates on the weather and help you plan your day accordingly. In conclusion, while technology has made our lives easier in some ways, it's still just as important to know how to deal with problems when it fails us. Whether it's losing your false teeth, needing a dog-minder, or getting caught in unexpected weather, there are always ways to cope and find a solution."},{"prompt":"Produce a long descriptive sentence that uses all these words: Abel Caballero, birthPlace, Spain; Abel Caballero, office, Mayor of Vigo; Abel Caballero, birthPlace, Galicia (Spain)","completion":"Abel Caballero, born in Galicia (Spain), holds the position of \\"Mayor of Vigo\\" in his office, which is located in the same birthplace region that shaped his character and led him to become a renowned politician such as himself."},{"prompt":"Test sentence: The metal was hammered flat.
