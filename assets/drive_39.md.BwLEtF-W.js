The 28-year-old started his career at the age of just 13 with Lanceros Boyaca in his homeland, before moving to River Plate in Argentina. It wasn't long before European clubs began to take notice of his talents, and he made the switch to Porto in Portugal in 2009. It was in Portugal where Falcao truly established himself as one of Europe's most feared strikers. He scored an incredible 72 goals in just two seasons for Porto, including a remarkable hat-trick in the final of the 2011 Europa League as they beat fellow Portuguese side Braga 1-0. Falcao then moved on to Atletico Madrid, where he continued his goalscoring exploits. He helped the Spanish side win the Europa League in his first season, before finishing as the top scorer in La Liga the following year with 24 goals. After a short spell with Monaco in France, injuries saw Falcao struggle for form and fitness over the past couple of seasons. However, his move to Manchester United on loan from Monaco has reinvigorated him, and he will be hoping to make a big impact in the Premier League. With his impressive track record and natural goalscoring ability, there is no doubt that Falcao has the potential to become a real star at Old Trafford.

Set a diminishing grieving period. Keep up with your hobbies. Meditate. Keep your hygiene uptopar. Take something to help you sleep. See a therapist. Write about the breakup.","completion":"Breaking up with someone can be one of the most difficult experiences to go through. The mourning process can be long and overwhelming, making it difficult to move on. However, there are proactive steps you can take to make this process more manageable. The very first step towards moving on from your breakup is to avoid your ex. This may seem obvious, but frequently seeing or hearing about your ex can make the grieving process even worse. Try cutting off all contact and, if possible, avoid places you know your ex frequents. Next, set a diminishing grieving period. It's important to acknowledge the pain of the breakup, but dwelling on it indefinitely will only prolong the healing process. Give yourself a set timeframe to grieve, and stick to it. Over time, the pain should lessen, and you can begin to move on. Keeping up with your hobbies is another important step in the healing process. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help shift your focus away from the breakup and onto positive things in your life. Meditation has also shown to be a powerful tool in helping people move on from heartbreak. It can help calm your mind and give you a sense of control over your emotions. Taking care of your hygiene and appearance is another important step. When you look good, you often feel good too. If you're struggling to sleep due to the breakup, consider taking something to help. However, make sure to consult with your doctor first. Seeing a therapist can also be extremely beneficial. They can provide support and guidance as you navigate the emotions of the breakup. Finally, writing about the relationship and breakup can be cathartic. Putting your thoughts and feelings on paper can help you process them and move on.

Learn about other disorders that can cause a lack of confidence.","completion":"When it comes to mental health diagnosis, it's important to consider a variety of factors and possibilities. One condition that may initially come to mind when dealing with a lack of confidence is Schizoid Personality Disorder. However, it's crucial to rule this out before moving forward with any other potential diagnoses. Schizoid Personality Disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a limited range of emotional expression. While it may seem like a natural fit given its tendencies towards detachment, a lack of confidence is not necessarily a defining characteristic of the disorder. Instead, professionals should consider the possibility that the individual may be experiencing Social Anxiety Disorder. Often accompanied by feelings of low self-esteem or self-worth, this condition can manifest in a variety of ways. For instance, a person living with social anxiety disorder may experience intense fear, nervousness, or embarrassment in social situations. They may avoid parties or other gatherings, fearing that they will be the object of others' judgment or ridicule. It's important to take a broad view when considering a lack of confidence. Other conditions can impact one's self-image, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and eating disorders. By analyzing an individual's specific symptoms and behaviors, a diagnosis can be reached with confidence, leading to more effective treatments to help them regain their confidence and improve their overall mental health. Ultimately, anyone who is struggling with a lack of confidence, social anxiety or other problems should seek professional help as soon as possible, in order to find the support they need to feel their best."},{"prompt":"Please add spaces between words: Theteam’sgriponthiswillcreatediversityandacloseurbanheartinthearea.","completion":"The team’s grip on this will create diversity and a close urban heart in the area."},{"prompt":"From last few months I am getting more into porn videos and I can see myself converting into a pervert.

However, it’s important to ensure you do everything correctly to provide a healthy and safe home for them to thrive. The first step to this is setting up the tank properly. One of the most crucial items you’ll need to invest in is an external canister filter. This device will help keep the water in your tank clean and free of harmful bacteria. The external canister filter is easy to install and maintain, and with frequent cleaning, it will keep your tank pond-like clear. Substrate is another essential element that is required when setting up your tank. Substrate not only adds aesthetic value to your tank but also helps your aquatic pets’ health. It provides a place for healthy bacteria to grow, which helps in breaking down the excess waste in the water while maintaining good quality. When it comes to lighting, it’s essential to keep it minimal. Excess light can cause an increase in temperature, leading to the production of harmful algae. Alternatively, you can consider LED lights that work efficiently and maintain a cooler temperature. As you set up your tank, ensure you follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Additionally, make sure your pets have enough room to swim around freely and add plants that will help improve their health.

According to the study, people who type on their phones while walking are less likely to keep their balance and walk in a straight line.

The researchers analyzed data from 26 participants who were asked to walk along a 9-meter-long path while completing various tasks on their phones, including texting, reading emails, and scrolling through social media. The study found that participants who were texting while walking were more likely to deviate from a straight path and were less stable than those who were not. While this behavior may seem harmless, it can pose serious safety risks in crowded environments or when walking near busy roads. The study's authors suggest that individuals be mindful of their surroundings and limit their phone use while walking to prevent accidents.

However, he was later released after the court heard that he is the principal carer for his seriously ill wife. Bridgeman, who is estimated to be worth several million pounds, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice after he lied to police about who was driving his car when it was involved in a collision in October 2016. He initially claimed that his wife had been driving, but later admitted that he had been behind the wheel. During his sentencing hearing, Bridgeman's lawyers argued that he should be spared jail as he is the primary carer for his wife, who suffers from a serious medical condition. They also highlighted his long career as a successful lawyer and his charitable work. Despite the mitigation, the judge ultimately sentenced Bridgeman to a year in prison. However, after hearing that his wife would be left without adequate care if he was behind bars, the judge agreed to release him on compassionate grounds. The case has sparked debate about the use of mitigating factors in sentencing. While some have argued that Bridgeman should have been given a harsher sentence for perverting the course of justice, others have praised the judge for taking into account the impact that his imprisonment would have on his wife. Overall, this case highlights the difficult balancing act that judges must perform when sentencing defendants.

Guy of Dampierre, who was facing financial difficulties at the time, struggled to meet the people's demands. Instead of addressing the issue, he continued to impose heavy taxes on the citizens, which only worsened the situation. As a result of this action, the citizens of Flanders rebelled against the count and formed an alliance with King Philip IV of France. The French king was eager to take advantage of the situation and use it to his benefit, thus launching an attack on Flanders. Faced with the threat of French invasion, Guy of Dampierre realized that he needed help to counter the French forces. In the end, he turned to King Edward I of England for assistance. It is estimated that Guy of Dampierre sought King Edward's help in 1299, two years after the tax complaints were first made.

However, it was not until over a decade later, on July 24, 1939, that the Allies signed a final peace treaty with the Republic of Turkey. This treaty, known as the Montreux Convention, affirmed Turkey's sovereignty over its territory and granted it control over the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits. There were several reasons for the delay in reaching a final peace agreement with Turkey. First, Turkey had not been a part of the Central Powers during World War I and did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, so it was not included in the initial negotiations for post-war peace. Additionally, Turkey had undergone significant political and social change during the 1920s and 1930s, as the country's founder, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, implemented reforms aimed at modernizing and secularizing Turkish society. Negotiations for a final peace treaty between the Allies and Turkey began in the late 1930s, with the Montreux Convention finally signed in July 1939. Unfortunately, this treaty did not prevent Turkey from being drawn into World War II, as it joined the Allies in 1945 as a means of protecting its territorial integrity and ensuring its independence.

While washing and drying her hair extensions, she left them on her bed to complete her homework. Upon returning to her room, she found that her entire bedroom was filled with smoke. The fire took hold and eventually gutted her entire room, leaving nothing but cinders. This unfortunate incident serves as a reminder that hair dryers, if not used carefully, can pose a significant fire hazard. Hair dryers generate substantial amounts of heat, which can easily ignite flammable materials such as towels, bed sheets, and hair extensions. To prevent such incidents from happening, it is essential to use hair dryers carefully and to follow basic safety precautions. Firstly, it is necessary to keep hair dryers away from flammable materials at all times, particularly when they are in use. Users should also avoid leaving hair dryers unattended, especially when they are still hot. It is wise to switch off and unplug hair dryers once they have fulfilled their purpose. It is also important to clean hair dryers regularly to ensure that the vents are not blocked, as clogged vents can cause overheating and lead to a fire. Furthermore, it is wise to ensure that smoke detectors are installed in all rooms of the house, particularly the bedrooms, where hair dryers are commonly in use. Smoke detectors can quickly alert individuals to the presence of smoke, giving them early warning to evacuate the building. This incident should serve as a cautionary tale to all individuals who use hair dryers. It is essential to use hair dryers with care, to follow basic safety precautions, and to remain vigilant at all times.

Non-verbal communication is just as important as verbal communication when it comes to conveying our thoughts and feelings. This includes our facial expressions, body language, and how we interact with others. One of the most effective ways to communicate positively is to smile often. Smiling has a positive effect on the person you are speaking with and can help to make them feel more comfortable and engaged in the conversation. Additionally, projecting an open posture by facing the person, keeping your arms uncrossed and your body relaxed sends a message that you are open and approachable. Making eye contact is another important aspect of non-verbal communication that can help to establish trust and build rapport. It shows that you are actively listening and interested in what the other person has to say. However, it is important to maintain a level of eye contact that is appropriate for the situation, as too much or too little eye contact can be perceived as uncomfortable or even aggressive. Fidgeting and other nervous movements can be distracting and convey a lack of confidence, so it is important to be aware of your body language and avoid these types of behaviors. Instead, try to mirror the other person's movements as this helps to establish a connection and builds rapport. In conclusion, effective non-verbal communication is essential for building positive relationships. By smiling often, projecting an open posture, making frequent eye contact, avoiding nervous behaviors, and mirroring the other person's movements, you can convey a message of confidence and approachability that will help you to be successful in both your personal and professional life."},{"prompt":"Do these mean the same?

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The issue of birthright citizenship has once again come to the forefront in the United States, with a proposal in Arizona that could deny birth certificates to children of illegal immigrants. This controversial idea has received both support and opposition from various groups. If enacted, the law would mean that children born in Arizona to undocumented parents would not receive a birth certificate. This would make it very difficult for them to obtain other necessary documents such as a driver's license or passport. It would also potentially lead to stateless individuals who are not recognized as citizens by any country. The proposal is set to be taken up in the fall by the Arizona legislature. It is unclear whether it would pass or even be legal under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which grants citizenship to all individuals born in the country. Proponents of the idea argue that it would deter illegal immigration and save taxpayer dollars by reducing government benefits to undocumented individuals and their families. They also assert that birthright citizenship is being abused and exploited by those who enter the country illegally in order to have children who are automatically granted citizenship. Opponents of the proposal, on the other hand, say that it is unconstitutional and violates basic human rights. They argue that denying birth certificates to these children is cruel and could lead to greater social and economic problems in the long run. Furthermore, they claim that the proposal is motivated by thinly veiled racism and xenophobia. The debate over birthright citizenship is a complex and emotional one. It touches on issues of national identity, immigration policy, and the rights of individuals.

The top performer in the list was Latvia's own airBaltic, which had an impressive 90.01% on-time performance score. Hawaiian Airlines also ranked high among the list, with a score of 87.24%. Other notable airlines that made it on the list included Iberia, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines. This ranking is particularly important for frequent travelers who value punctuality when traveling. On-time performance is essential especially for business travelers, as it can greatly impact their productivity and schedules. The ranking is also relevant for leisure travelers who want to arrive at their destinations on-time and without delays. While easyJet and Monarch Airlines made the top 20, their positions were not particularly high on the list. EasyJet ranked 13th with a 79.05% on-time performance score, while Monarch Airlines ranked 16th with a score of 76.57%. The ranking serves as a reminder for airlines to focus on their on-time performance to remain competitive in the market. Punctuality is a crucial factor for travelers when selecting an airline. Improving on-time performance can also increase an airline's revenue as it helps retain customers and foster better loyalty. In conclusion, the recently released OAG ranking of global airlines based on their on-time performance highlights the importance of punctuality in the airline industry.

However, there are several steps that you can take to get rid of these pests and prevent them from returning. The following tips can help you eliminate moth infestation in your home. Locate the Source of the Infestation The first step is to locate the source of the infestation. Look for signs of moths such as larvae or webbing in your closet or dressers. Once you have found the source, discard all infested items to prevent the spread of the larvae. Clean Clothes and Closet Once you have eliminated infested items, you should clean your closet and clothes thoroughly. Wash all clothing, bedding, and linens in hot water to kill any remaining moths or larvae. Vacuum and wipe down the inside of your closet to remove any debris or webbing. Use Pheromone Moth Traps Pheromone moth traps are useful tools for trapping adult moths. The traps use a scent that mimics female moths to lure males and prevent them from mating. Place the traps in your closet or dressers to catch any remaining moths. Use Mothballs Mothballs are another effective way to prevent moth infestation. Place them in your closet to repel moths and keep them from laying eggs. However, keep in mind that mothballs contain toxic chemicals and should be handled with caution. Iron Clothes Ironing your clothes after washing and drying them can also prevent moth infestation. Moths don't like heat, so ironing your clothing can kill any remaining eggs or larvae. Freeze Wool Items Wool items should be frozen to kill any moths or eggs. Place the wool items in a plastic bag and leave them in the freezer for at least 72 hours to ensure that all moths and eggs are killed. Fumigate If all else fails, fumigate your home. A professional fumigation company can use chemicals to eliminate any remaining moths or larvae. However, this should be considered a last resort as it can be expensive and requires you to vacate your home for a period of time. In conclusion, these are some effective tips for eliminating moth infestation. Remember to regularly clean and inspect your closet and clothing to prevent future infestations. With these steps, you can successfully rid your home of moths and prevent them from returning."},{"prompt":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: DetteindlægblevudgivetiPsykiatriogtaggetantidepressiva,depression,fdaanalysis,majordepression,mooddisorders,psychotherapies,randomizedcontrolledtrials,risiko,selvmord,serotoninreuptakeinhibitors,ssriden3.februar2009afMadsChristianJensen.Ketaminetreatmentfordepression?SkrivetsvarExperimentalAntidepressantUse","completion":"This post was published in Psychiatry and tagged antidepressiva, depression, FDA analysis, major depression, mood disorders, psychotherapies, randomized controlled trials, risiko, selvmord, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRI on February 3, 2009 by Mads Christian Jensen.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of chemical energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. As a byproduct of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion. Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.

His son, Dmitry Ivanovich, on the other hand, was murdered on May 15, 1591, seven years after his father's death. Therefore, the death of Tsar Ivan IV happened first, followed by the death of his son Dmitry. Ivan the Terrible was the Grand Prince of Moscow from 1533 to 1547 and then the first Tsar of all Russia from 1547 until his death in 1584. He rose to power at a young age and is known for his ruthless nature, particularly during the later years of his reign. Dmitry Ivanovich was the son of Ivan the Terrible and his wife, Anastasia Romanovna. He was born in 1582 and is best known for his mysterious death. According to the official version of events, Dmitry was murdered by a group of boyars, or Russian nobles, who were opposed to his father's rule. However, some historians believe that Dmitry may have actually survived the attack and that the person who was killed was an imposter. In conclusion, the death of Tsar Ivan IV occurred first in 1584, while the death of his son Dmitry Ivanovich occurred seven years later in 1591.

Prime Minister indicates he is prepared to send in SAS once he has a target.","completion":"David Cameron, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, ordered spy chiefs to the Chequers after the killing of aid worker Alan Henning by ISIS militants. The spy chiefs apparently informed him that they were unable to locate the militants responsible for the heinous act. According to reports, Cameron had indicated that he was prepared to deploy the SAS (Special Air Service) once a target had been identified. This decision was part of the UK's efforts to combat terrorism and protect its citizens both at home and abroad. The brutal murder of Alan Henning, who had gone to Syria to provide humanitarian aid, sparked international outrage and condemnation. The UK government vowed to do everything in its power to bring those responsible to justice. Cameron's decision to call in the spy chiefs and prepare to deploy the SAS demonstrates the seriousness with which the government regarded the threat of terrorism at that time. It also highlights the complex and challenging nature of modern warfare, where the enemy is often difficult to identify and locate. In such situations, intelligence agencies play a crucial role in gathering and analyzing information to identify targets and plan operations. The deployment of elite military units such as the SAS is a last resort but, when necessary, is a highly effective means of neutralizing high-value targets and disrupting terrorist networks. Overall, Cameron's response to the killing of Alan Henning reflects the UK's determination to protect its citizens and maintain its national security in the face of evolving threats. While the fight against terrorism is ongoing, the government's commitment to combatting it remains steadfast."},{"prompt":"Ugh!!!! The one time I didn't check google or yelp for a review..

However, with a little preparation and strategy, it can be a successful and enjoyable experience for everyone involved. Here are some helpful tips for parents to follow when dining out with young children. First and foremost, when making a reservation or checking in at the restaurant, request to be seated in a quiet corner or next to a wall, preferably in a booth. This will not only help to minimize distractions for your child but will also reduce any potential disruptions to other diners. Next, keep a close eye on your child at all times, especially in a busy and unfamiliar environment. Children can easily wander off or get into mischief without parental supervision, so it's crucial to prioritize their safety by staying vigilant. Additionally, pay attention to your child's hunger cues and try to order their food as soon as possible. Waiting too long can result in crankiness and tantrums, which can be uncomfortable for everyone. When you receive your entrees, ask for the check immediately. This will help you to make a quick exit if necessary and ensure that you're not delaying other diners. Knowing your child's tendency to spill things is also crucial. Be sure to ask for sturdy plates and cups, and consider bringing a small bib or towel to prevent any potential messes. If your child has a meltdown, ignore any comments or looks from other diners. They may not understand the challenges of dining out with young children, and it's essential not to let their judgments affect your dining experience. Furthermore, be prepared if your child's order goes wrong or if they do not like their food. Having a backup plan, such as bringing snacks or offering to exchange the dish, can help alleviate any potential issues. Lastly, if your child makes it through the entire meal without any significant disruptions, be sure to praise them for a job well done. This positive reinforcement can help encourage good behavior during future outings.

The case came to light after a convicted sex offender, Phillip Garrido, admitted to having abducted Dugard. He was arrested and booked on charges related to the kidnapping, along with his wife, Nancy Garrido. The couple is believed to have held Dugard captive in a series of tents and sheds behind their home in Antioch, California. The details of the case are nothing short of horrifying. According to reports, Dugard was sexually assaulted multiple times by her captor and gave birth to two daughters while in captivity. The children, who are now 15 and 11, were also kept hidden from the world. The discovery of Dugard was the result of a routine visit from a campus police officer to Garrido's home. Suspicious of the makeshift tents and shacks on his property, the officer questioned Garrido, who was then on parole for a previous rape conviction. A subsequent investigation led to Dugard's location and the arrests of Garrido and his wife. The case has raised many questions about how such a heinous crime could have gone undetected for so long. Dugard was kept hidden in a residential area, and is now known to have been in contact with members of Garrido's extended family. How is it that no one noticed anything amiss? For Dugard, the road to recovery will be long and difficult. She has been reunited with the family she was separated from nearly two decades ago, but the scars of her ordeal will never fully heal. The Garridos are now in custody, and will face a long trial for their crimes. For the rest of us, the case is a reminder of the twisted actions that some individuals are capable of. It is a wakeup call to be watchful of our surroundings and to report anything suspicious to law enforcement officials. And for Jaycee Dugard and her family, it is a story of hope and resilience in the face of unimaginable adversity."},{"prompt":"Sentence 1: but she's she's usually pretty good Sentence 2: She's usually doing well.

It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be unoriginal, hence establishing a critical text, or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both external evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and internal or physical considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done).

This means paying attention to grammar, structure, and organization. Start your assignments as soon as possible, break them down into manageable pieces, and proofread the final draft before submission. Another essential aspect of homework is time management. Make sure to utilize your time wisely by setting yourself a schedule and sticking to it. It's also vital to take breaks and avoid burnout.

Secondly, good posture is another key factor in delivering a commanding speech. Standing or sitting up straight will help you project your voice and add confidence to your body language, making you look poised and in control. Moving on to arm movement, this may seem trivial, but the right use of your arms can make a significant difference in how you come across to your audience. Strategic arm movements can emphasize points in your speech and increase engagement with your listeners. Lastly, working with a vocal coach can maximize your potential as a public speaker. They can guide you on breathing techniques, vocal projection, and help you identify and address any bad habits that may hinder your delivery.

This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A skijump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a skijump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.

However, based on data from the United States Census Bureau in 2019, married couples living together make up the larger group. According to the data, there were approximately 128 million households in the United States in 2019. Of those households, 50.7% consisted of married couples living together, while 27% were made up of individuals living alone. It is important to note that the percentage of households made up of individuals living alone has been steadily increasing over the years. In 1960, only 13% of households were made up of individuals living alone, whereas in 2019 that percentage had more than doubled to 27%. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including an aging population, delayed marriage rates, and societal shifts towards valuing independence and individualism. Furthermore, it is essential to consider that household composition can vary greatly depending on the age group being analyzed. For instance, among adults aged 18-34, households containing only one person outnumber households with married couples living together. On the other hand, for adults aged 35 and older, households with married couples living together are more prevalent. In conclusion, while the percentage of households made up of individuals living alone has been increasing steadily over the years, based on data from the United States Census Bureau in 2019, married couples living together make up the larger group overall. However, it's important to take into account demographic shifts and age groups when analyzing household composition."},{"prompt":"f Group sitting on a grassy hill resting., does this mean that A group of people are sitting on a grassy hill and resting.?
