A stigma surrounds seeking mental health treatment in the Arab world, a counselor says.","completion":"Muntaha Fleful's Life with PTSD in Dearborn Muntaha Fleful was just 8 years old when she was injured in a 2004 attack in Iraq. Now, in her early 20s and living in Dearborn, Michigan, she struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Fleful's story highlights an important issue among the Arab-American population - the difficulty of accessing mental health treatment. Dearborn is home to the largest Arab-American population in the United States, including a large number of Iraqis. However, a stigma surrounds seeking mental health treatment in the Arab world. As a result, many people suffer in silence, unsure of where to turn for help. According to one counselor who works with the community, this stigma stems from a belief that mental illness is a weakness that should be hidden. Seeking professional help could be seen as an admission of failure, bringing shame upon the individual and their family. This is compounded by a lack of resources and understanding within the community about mental health issues. Fleful's experience highlights the effects of this stigma. She recalls feeling lost and alone, unable to talk to anyone about her feelings in the aftermath of the attack. It wasn't until she came to the United States, where mental health resources are more widely available and accepted, that she was able to seek the help she needed. Fleful's story is a call to action for us all. We must work together to break down the barriers that prevent people from seeking the help they need. This means increasing awareness and understanding of mental health issues in Arab-American communities, as well as investing in resources to provide accessible mental health care. Only then can we hope to create a culture where seeking help is seen as a sign of strength rather than weakness."},{"prompt":"volvo bodybuilder instructions product features : volvo trucks Repeat this setence, but with the correct capitalization.","completion":"Volvo Bodybuilder Instructions - Product features: Volvo Trucks."},{"prompt":"What most naturally follows?

The properties vary greatly, from a studio flat in Thamesmead to a two-bedroom house in Kingsbury.

The first step in choosing the perfect dress is determining the message you want to convey. This decision should be based on the type of event, as not all colors are appropriate for every occasion. For example, a black dress may be ideal for a funeral, but it may not be suitable for a casual day wedding. Another important factor to consider when choosing a dress is the event's theme. If it's a themed event, make sure your dress aligns with the theme. Additionally, if you have a date, it's crucial to consider what they will be wearing to ensure that both of you look cohesive.

Choosing a dress that complements your figure can enhance your confidence and showcase your assets. The length of the dress is another crucial factor to think about. For formal events, a floor-length dress is appropriate, while knee-length dresses are perfect for semi-formal occasions. Short dresses are ideal for more casual events.

These measures include tighter security procedures, more extensive background checks, and closer supervision of Afghan security personnel. The death of Greg Buckley Jr. highlights the dangers faced by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Despite efforts to prevent such attacks, green-on-blue violence continues to claim the lives of U.S. service members. It is a sobering reminder that the conflict in Afghanistan remains a deadly one."},{"prompt":"ere is a premise: I looked at the next tube along.

Reformat and streamline your resume. Select a functional or combination resume format. Don’t list “references available” at the bottom of your resume.","completion":"Having an online presence is becoming increasingly important in today's digital age. However, if you don't have one, don't worry. There are still ways to make yourself stand out to potential employers. When writing your resume, it's important to mention why you don't have an online presence. Perhaps you prefer to keep your personal life separate from your professional one, or maybe you simply haven't had the time to create accounts on various social media platforms. Whatever the reason, owning up to it in a concise manner can show that you are honest and confident. One way to make your resume more attention-grabbing is to reformat and streamline it. Instead of listing out every single job you've ever had, focus on the ones that are most relevant to the position you are applying for. Additionally, consider using a functional or combination resume format. These allow you to highlight your skills and accomplishments, rather than simply listing your job titles. Finally, it's important to omit the phrase \\"references available upon request\\" at the bottom of your resume. This is considered standard practice, so there's no need to include it. Instead, focus on making your resume as clear, concise, and impactful as possible. In conclusion, having an online presence can certainly be advantageous when it comes to job hunting. However, if you don't have one, don't let that hold you back. With a well-crafted resume and a confident attitude, you can make yourself stand out to potential employers."},{"prompt":"Repetitive music, annoying narration, terrible cinematography effects. Half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fight.

In the Basque Country, it is a common belief that the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the Basque Country, where one of the fishing towns is also called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in Basque, Donibane).

They develop as a result of friction or pressure on the skin, and can often cause discomfort or pain. While there are many different ways to remove calluses, over-the-counter medications can be an effective option for those looking for a quick fix. Salicylic acid is a common ingredient in many of these products, as it helps to break down the thickened skin and promote healing. Alternatively, aspirin can be crushed and applied topically to provide a similar result. It is important to note that if over-the-counter medications do not provide relief, or if the callus shows signs of being infected, it is important to see a doctor. Infected calluses can cause more serious issues, such as cellulitis or abscesses, and require medical attention. In addition, people with diabetes, circulation problems, or other underlying medical conditions should also consult with a medical professional before attempting any at-home callus removal methods. In conclusion, over-the-counter medications and topical treatments can be an effective way to remove calluses. Salicylic acid or aspirin can be applied to the affected area, but it is important to seek medical attention if these methods do not provide relief or if the callus appears infected.

Contemporary scholars have argued to the contrary, asserting that the period produced significant innovations and music on its own. Simon Reynolds described the period as a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created, the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it, and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era. Nicholas Lezard wrote that the music of the period was avantgarde, open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves, united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral, concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience, or making them think, as in making a pop song.

The Homeric hymn adds that Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. Apollo Delphinios was a seagod especially worshiped in Crete and in the islands, and his name indicates his connection with Delphi and the holy serpent Delphyne (womb).[citation needed] Apollo's sister Artemis, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with Britomartis (Diktynna), the Minoan Mistress of the animals. In her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the Mister of the animals, a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute.

Milan are said to be demanding £30million for the Italy international, who joined the club in January 2013 after an ill-fated spell at Manchester City. Balotelli has failed to live up to his potential at Milan, managing just 26 goals in 43 appearances for the Serie A giants. Arsenal have been linked with the striker for some time, with manager Arsene Wenger known to be an admirer of Balotelli's talent. The Gunners are in need of a new striker, with Olivier Giroud currently the club's only recognised centre-forward. Napoli are also considering a move for the controversial striker, with manager Rafa Benitez said to be keen on bringing Balotelli to the San Paolo stadium. The Serie A side have cash to spend after selling star striker Edinson Cavani to Paris Saint-Germain for a reported £55million. Milan's stance on Balotelli's future is unclear, with Berlusconi refusing to confirm or deny the possibility of a sale.

OPTIONS: no ye","completion":"Yes."},{"prompt":"Write an article based on this Find the third angle of an isosceles triangle. Find the third angle of an equilateral triangle. Find the third angle of a right triangle.","completion":"In geometry, triangles come in various shapes and sizes, each with its unique properties. One of the basic concepts in the study of triangles is the measurement of their angles. Knowing the angle measures of a triangle can help in solving problems involving geometry and trigonometry. In this article, we will discuss how to find the third angle of different types of triangles. Firstly, let's consider an isosceles triangle, where two sides of the triangle are equal. Since there are a total of 180 degrees in any triangle, an isosceles triangle's two angles must be equal to one another to balance out the third angle. To find the third angle of an isosceles triangle, we can use the formula 180 - 2x, where \\"x\\" is the measure of the equal angles. By subtracting twice the equal angle's measurement from 180 degrees, we can find the third angle's measurement. For example, if the measure of each equal angle is 60 degrees, the third angle measure would be 60 degrees (180 - 2(60) = 60). Next, let's move onto an equilateral triangle, where all three sides and angles are equal. Since all angles in an equilateral triangle are equal, we can use a simpler formula to find the measure of each angle. We divide the total measure of 180 degrees by 3 since there are 3 identical angles, giving us 60 degrees. Therefore, each angle of an equilateral triangle measures 60 degrees, making it the only triangle whose angle measures are all the same. Lastly, we will discuss how to find the third angle of a right triangle, where one angle measures 90 degrees. Since a right triangle's two other angles must add up to 90 degrees, we can use this knowledge to find the third angle's measurement. To do this, we take 180 degrees (the total measure of a triangle) and subtract 90 degrees (the measure of the right angle) and the measure of the second angle. The result is the measure of the third angle. For example, if we know one of the angles is 30 degrees, the third angle will be (180 - 90 - 30) 60 degrees. In conclusion, knowing how to find the third angle of different types of triangles can help in solving geometry and trigonometry problems. Remember that for an isosceles triangle, we subtract twice the measure of one of the equal angles from 180 degrees, for an equilateral triangle, we divide 180 degrees by 3, and for a right triangle, we subtract the measure of the right angle and the second angle from 180 degrees."},{"prompt":"What is the title of this article: The decision to change strategy is sometimes claimed as a major mistake by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL). It is argued that persisting with attacks on RAF airfields might have won air superiority for the Luftwaffe. Others argue that the Luftwaffe made little impression on Fighter Command in the last week of August and first week of September and that the shift in strategy was not decisive. It has also been argued that it was doubtful the Luftwaffe could have won air superiority before the weather window began to deteriorate in October. It was also possible, if RAF losses became severe, that they could pull out to the north, wait for the German invasion, then redeploy southward again. Other historians argue that the outcome of the air battle was irrelevant; the massive numerical superiority of British naval forces and the inherent weakness of the Kriegsmarine would have made the projected German invasion, Unternehmen Seelöwe (Operation Sea Lion), a disaster with or without German air superiority.","completion":"The article does not have a clear title."},{"prompt":"ere is a dialogue: Susan: Dad!

Learn the semitones. Work on vibrato. Use glissandos.","completion":"If you're serious about playing a musical instrument, whether it's the violin, flute, or saxophone, it's important to continually challenge yourself and work on improving your skills. One way to do this is by practicing playing high notes. High notes can be intimidating for many players, but with regular practice, you can become more comfortable and confident playing them. Start by learning the different semitones and how they relate to playing high notes. This will help you understand the different fingerings and techniques needed to play each note accurately. Another technique to practice when playing high notes is vibrato. Vibrato is a slight variation in pitch that can add depth and emotion to your playing. It can also help you achieve a more natural and fluid sound when playing high notes. In addition to vibrato, glissandos can also be used to enhance your playing of high notes. A glissando involves sliding your finger up or down the length of the instrument, rather than playing each individual note. This technique can help you connect notes and create a smoother transition between high and low notes. While practicing high notes can be challenging, it's important to remember to take it slow and work on each technique individually before attempting to combine them. Consistent practice and a willingness to learn and improve can help you achieve success in playing high notes and enhance your overall musicianship."},{"prompt":"“What do you do with a brilliant person that’s not a team player?

An infection can occur at any time, but it is most likely to happen in the first few weeks after the piercing. If you suspect that you have an infection, it is important to recognize the signs and take action immediately. The signs of an infected piercing may include redness, swelling, pain, warmth to the touch, and pus or discharge. If you notice any of these symptoms, you should see a professional to treat or drain the bump. In some cases, you may need to take antibiotics or have the piercing removed. It is important to note that you should not remove your jewelry if you suspect an infection. Removing the jewelry can cause the hole to close up, trapping the infection inside. This can lead to more severe problems, such as an abscess or even blood poisoning. By leaving the jewelry in place, you allow the infection to drain and prevent further complications. In order to prevent infections, it is important to follow proper aftercare instructions for your piercing. This may include cleaning the area with a saline solution, avoiding touching the piercing with dirty hands, and avoiding swimming or soaking in bodies of water. If you notice any signs of an infection, do not hesitate to seek help from a professional. In conclusion, recognizing the signs of an infection and seeking treatment immediately is crucial for the health of your piercing. Do not attempt to remove your jewelry if you suspect an infection, as this can lead to more severe problems. By taking proper care of your piercing and seeking help when needed, you can enjoy your new body art without any worries."},{"prompt":"(b) What Can Eventually Happen to Me?

One of the most important things to remember is to avoid housing skinks with cage mates in general. While skinks are social creatures, they can become aggressive with other skinks if they feel their territory is being invaded. If you do decide to introduce tank mates, it's important to only do so if they are of a similar size. This helps to prevent any one animal from dominating the other or causing harm to a smaller companion. It's also important to closely monitor the skinks if they are housed together to ensure they're getting along. When it comes to handling your skink, it's important to do so with care. Skinks have delicate bodies that can easily be injured if not handled correctly. Always support their entire body when picking them up and avoid any sudden movements that could cause them to fall or become injured. For those with children, it's important to make sure they know how to safely handle a skink. Supervise any interactions between your child and the skink to ensure that the skink isn't being mishandled.

Consider whether a medical reason might be at work. Understand the impact of picky eating.","completion":"When it comes to feeding our furry friends, we all want to ensure that they are receiving the necessary nutrients to keep them healthy and happy. However, sometimes it can feel like your dog is intentionally ignoring their food, leaving you feeling frustrated and unsure of what to do next. Before you jump to conclusions or become too concerned, it's important to realize that your dog may simply be a picky eater by choice. There are a few reasons why dogs may become picky eaters. It's possible that they may have a medical issue that is causing them to lose their appetite, such as dental problems or gastrointestinal issues. If your dog suddenly becomes picky or refuses to eat, it's worth getting them checked out by a veterinarian to rule out any underlying health concerns. Another reason why dogs may become picky eaters is due to their unique preferences. Just like humans, dogs have individual tastes and may not like certain flavors or textures. It's important to pay attention to your dog's behavior and preferences when it comes to their food. If they consistently turn their nose up at a certain type of food, it's worth trying something different to see if they respond better. The impact of picky eating can vary depending on the severity of the issue. If your dog is only mildly picky, it may not have a significant impact on their health. However, if they aren't getting the necessary nutrients they need or consistently refuse to eat, it can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, and other health problems. In conclusion, it's important to understand that picky eating in dogs is not uncommon and can often be resolved with a little patience and experimentation. If you notice a sudden change in your dog's eating habits or are concerned about their overall health, it's always best to seek the advice of a veterinarian. By paying attention to your dog's preferences and needs, you can ensure that they are getting the proper nutrition they need to live a long and healthy life."},{"prompt":"Select the topic that this about: By MICHAEL HILL (AP) Americans are more calorieconscious and holding the line on weight gain after years of expanding waistlines, according to a market survey released Wednesday, but nutrition experts were wary of the findings.

It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman.

Uranium235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope. Uranium238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium235 and to a lesser degree uranium233 have a much higher fission crosssection for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons.

This statement comes in response to the recent rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, which occurred on August 4, 2021. Fortunately, there have been no immediate reports of anyone being injured as a result of the rocket attacks. However, the Israeli military and Lebanese media have reported that at least 20 rockets were fired in retaliation. Attacking civilians while hiding among the population is a cowardly and inhumane act. It endangers innocent lives and violates the principles of international law. Netanyahu's condemnation of this tactic is an important reminder that such actions will not be tolerated. In response to the rocket attacks, it is crucial for both sides to exercise restraint and avoid further escalation of the situation. Diplomatic channels should be utilized to address any grievances and work towards a peaceful resolution. We hope that both Israel and Lebanon can find a way to resolve their differences and coexist peacefully.

Try not to take it personally. Remove yourself from the situation if you need to. Make your safety a priority.","completion":"When dealing with negative moods or emotions from others, it's important to remember to avoid allowing them to rub off on you. This can be difficult, especially if you are empathetic or sensitive to the feelings of those around you. However, it's crucial to your own mental and emotional well-being to maintain a level of detachment. One key aspect of avoiding catching the negative mood or emotions of others is to try not to take it personally. Recognize that the other person's mood likely has nothing to do with you, and focus on being a supportive listener rather than reacting defensively. Taking things personally can only escalate the situation and make it harder to maintain a positive outlook. If you find yourself struggling to maintain a sense of detachment or if the situation becomes too overwhelming, it's perfectly acceptable to remove yourself from the situation. Take a step back, breathe deeply, and give yourself space to center your thoughts and emotions. This can help to prevent you from catching the negative mood and becoming overwhelmed by it. Above all, when dealing with the negative emotions of others, make your safety a priority. If you find yourself feeling threatened or in danger physically, do not hesitate to remove yourself from the situation and seek help from the appropriate authorities.

This causes an electrical current to begin flowing in the direction of the signal's instantaneous field. When the resulting current reaches the end of the conductor, it reflects, which is equivalent to a 180 degree change in phase. If the conductor is 1⁄4 of a wavelength long, current from the feed point will undergo 90 degree phase change by the time it reaches the end of the conductor, reflect through 180 degrees, and then another 90 degrees as it travels back. That means it has undergone a total 360 degree phase change, returning it to the original signal. The current in the element thus adds to the current being created from the source at that instant. This process creates a standing wave in the conductor, with the maximum current at the feed. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Whitney Barkley, a political analyst and senior policy counsel with the Center for Responsible Lending, believes that the government is finally holding for-profit colleges accountable for their actions. In her view, Corinthian Colleges, one of the largest for-profit college networks in the United States, must shut down due to inflated job rates and low graduation rates. Barkley contends that for-profit colleges charge exorbitant tuition fees but fail to prepare students for the job market. Rather than providing students with valuable skills and knowledge, these colleges leave students with high levels of debt and no real career prospects. According to Barkley, for-profits target vulnerable groups such as minorities, females, veterans, and blue-collar students, and then rip them off. The closure of Corinthian Colleges is, for Barkley, a sign that the government is finally taking action against predatory for-profit institutions. For years, Barkley and other experts have criticized for-profit colleges for their unscrupulous practices, which prey on the disadvantaged and vulnerable. While some may argue that for-profit colleges offer students more flexible options for obtaining an education, Barkley emphasizes that it is essential to provide students with quality education that prepares them for the job market. The closure of Corinthian Colleges, she says, is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that all students receive the education they need and deserve."},{"prompt":"Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass producing orangered to lemon yellow hues.

The 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus.

These studies suggest that men and women are different in terms of sexual arousal patterns and that this is also reflected in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to nonhuman stimuli. Sexual orientation has many dimensions (attractions, behavior, identity), of which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attractions which can be measured at present with some degree of physical precision. Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing nonhuman primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like emotional attachment) must be taken into account when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to sex.

One of the most notable is the Indigenous Innovation Initiative, which provides funding and support to indigenous innovators who are addressing critical social and environmental challenges faced by their communities. Another initiative supported by Brydson's foundation is the Couchiching Jubilee House, a center that provides transitional housing and support to indigenous women and their families.

The cloak rooms are places where elected officials can relax, have discussions, sleep, and speak to reporters. Nunes' claim, if true, would be a severe violation of lawmakers' privacy and raise serious concerns about governmental overreach. Nunes is not the only one sounding the alarm. Other lawmakers and journalists have called for Attorney General Eric Holder's resignation or firing. The DOJ, for its part, has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, but the very idea that such a breach of privacy could occur is deeply troubling. The cloak rooms should be sanctuaries for lawmakers in which they can speak freely without fear of being monitored. If the allegations made by Nunes are accurate, then this safe environment has been violated. Such intrusion by the DOJ would set a dangerous precedent and raise the question of what other places in the Capitol or beyond have been bugged. If the DOJ is indeed spying on elected officials, it is a blatant attack on democracy and the integrity of the US political system. While it is vital to investigate possible threatening activity, monitoring elected officials without just cause is not acceptable. If the DOJ has wiretapped the phones in the cloak room, it must be held to account for its actions. Nunes' allegation is not something that can be swept under the rug quietly. Lawmakers must address it, investigate it thoroughly, and hold those who are responsible accountable.
