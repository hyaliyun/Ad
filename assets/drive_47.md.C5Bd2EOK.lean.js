The nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.","completion":"The title of this article is not provided."},{"prompt":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to make cheesecake bites Beat the cream cheese with the butter.

The report states that the \\"Big 10\\" food and drink companies are emitting more greenhouse gases than entire countries such as Scandinavia, and that shifts in weather patterns due to climate change are already affecting food supplies worldwide. The charity warns that if companies such as Kellogg's do not take action to reduce their emissions and address the issue of climate change, the consequences could be dire. The report predicts that as many as 50 million more people could go hungry as a result of these changes. The food and drink industry is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around a quarter of global emissions. However, the report suggests that there is still much that can be done to reduce these emissions, such as adopting more sustainable farming practices and reducing food waste. In addition to the potential humanitarian cost of inaction on climate change, there are also financial risks for companies. As consumers increasingly demand more sustainable and environmentally-friendly products, those companies that fail to adapt could face financial ruin. The Oxfam report is a reminder that the issue of climate change is not just an environmental concern, but also an economic and social one. It is up to companies such as Kellogg's to take action and do their part to address this urgent issue. By reducing their emissions and adopting more sustainable practices, these companies can help to ensure that the world's food supplies remain secure for generations to come."},{"prompt":"Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best highspirited comedies I have ever seen.

Christopher Plummer shines especially bright as Lord Foppington, a noble with hair too big to fit in the door. The plot involves the usual 18th century stuff; mistaken identities, thwarted romances, corrupt government officials, and jokes at every turn.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, has promised to follow the guidelines \\"in letter and spirit\\" in regards to the ongoing demands of ending U.S drone attacks and covert operations on its soil. The statement comes following a NATO airstrike in November, which killed 24 Pakistani soldiers, plunging relations between the countries to an all-time low. Pakistan has long been opposed to U.S drone attacks, with the country's government and many of its citizens deeming it an infringement on the country's sovereignty. The November attack further fueled this sentiment and has led to a renewed demand for U.S covert operations to be brought to an end in Pakistan. Washington has responded to this call, stating that it looks forward to discussing the recommendations put forward by Pakistan's government. The U.S has acknowledged the importance of Pakistan's role in the region and has taken steps to amend relations between the countries. The ongoing tensions between the countries have significant impacts on regional stability, with both countries actively working towards maintaining peace and security within the area. The recent promises by both Prime Minister Imran Khan and the U.S government to address these issues are a positive step towards resolving the ongoing tensions.

The Pechenegs were thus secure to raid the lands of the Khazars from their base between the Volga and Don rivers, allowing them to expand to the west. Rus' relations with the Pechenegs were complex, as the groups alternately formed alliances with and against one another. The Pechenegs were nomads roaming the steppe raising livestock which they traded with the Rus' for agricultural goods and other products. The lucrative Rus' trade with the Byzantine Empire had to pass through Pechenegcontrolled territory, so the need for generally peaceful relations was essential. Nevertheless, while the Primary Chronicle reports the Pechenegs entering Rus' territory in 915 and then making peace, they were waging war with one another again in 920.

She was subjected to Twitter abuse after her Chelsea Flower Show shoot. The model has turned to a fatfreezing treatment in order to toneup.","completion":"Amy Willerton: From Marathon Training to Fat-Freezing Treatment Amy Willerton, the former Miss Universe Great Britain, has recently been at the center of media attention due to her weight fluctuations. Willerton, who trained for and completed the London Marathon earlier this year, admitted to gaining a few pounds during the training process. However, instead of being celebrated for her athletic achievement, she was the target of body shaming on social media, with some Twitter users even questioning her qualification to run the marathon. Unfortunately, the negativity did not stop there. Willerton was also criticized for her appearance in a photoshoot at the Chelsea Flower Show, where she wore a floral dress that some deemed as \\"unflattering.\\" Again, she received backlash on Twitter, with comments such as, \\"Looks like Amy Willerton has eaten all the flowers\\" and \\"Amy Willerton needs to lose some weight before she bursts out of that dress.\\" Despite the hurtful comments, Willerton refused to let the haters bring her down. Instead, she opted for a fat-freezing treatment in order to tone-up. This non-surgical procedure, also known as cryolipolysis, involves freezing and killing fat cells in targeted areas of the body. Willerton shared her experience on Instagram, saying, \\"I'm not ashamed to admit that I turned to a non-invasive body sculpting game-changer, @skinoassassins to help me improve the contours of my body.\\" While some may argue that Willerton is promoting an unhealthy and unrealistic standard of beauty, it's important to remember that everyone's journey to self-confidence and body positivity is unique. Willerton's decision to undergo a fat-freezing treatment should not be judged, nor should her weight gain during marathon training. Instead, what we should focus on is supporting and uplifting individuals regardless of their size or shape. In conclusion, Amy Willerton's story serves as a reminder that body shaming has no place in our society. We must strive to create a culture of acceptance and positivity, where individuals can feel confident and proud of their bodies no matter what they look like."},{"prompt":"Produce a detailed sentence about a restaurant using the following words: name = The Eagle, eatType = coffee shop, food = French, customer rating = 3 out of 5, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes, near = Burger King","completion":"The Eagle is a French coffee shop located in the city centre, near Burger King.

The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells. The first ironclad battleship, Gloire, was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two ironhulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an allarmored battle fleet. After the first clashes of ironclads (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat.

There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks are turned into smaller chucks. Perhaps not surprisingly, this happens when you chew your food. Once you swallow the food, your stomach also does some of this work. Chemical digestion occurs when food is broken down into useful nutrients. This is a chemical process that begins as you start to chew your food. The saliva in your mouth starts this process. Once you swallow, the acid in your stomach further breaks down food. From the stomach, the foods moves into the small intestine. In the small intestines, another set of chemicals goes to work. Are you surprised? Your small intestine, and not your stomach, does most of the work! Question: What is chemical digestion, and where does it occur?

This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector Léonce Rosenberg. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic Maurice Raynal (fr) as 'crystal' Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of World War I—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, the occult, and Henri Bergson's concept of duration—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.

Specifically, samsara refers to the process of cycling through one rebirth after another within the six realms of existence,[note 2] where each realm can be understood as physical realm or a psychological state characterized by a particular type of suffering.

After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square, he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose.

If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.

However the Talmud does not mention Mary by name and is considerate rather than only polemic. The story about Panthera is also found in the Toledot Yeshu, the literary origins of which can not be traced with any certainty and given that it is unlikely to go before the 4th century, it is far too late to include authentic remembrances of Jesus. The Blackwell Companion to Jesus states that the Toledot Yeshu has no historical facts as such, and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity. The name Panthera may be a distortion of the term parthenos (virgin) and Raymond E. Brown considers the story of Panthera a fanciful explanation of the birth of Jesus which includes very little historical evidence. Robert Van Voorst states that given that Toledot Yeshu is a medieval document and due to its lack of a fixed form and orientation towards a popular audience, it is most unlikely to have reliable historical information.

Fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since. The draft became extremely unpopular, and President Nixon ended it in 1973, forcing the military (the Army especially) to rely entirely upon volunteers.

One way to do this is by looking out for symptoms similar to those seen in humans. This can include things like lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you do notice any of these symptoms in your pet, it's important to monitor their severity. In some cases, the symptoms may be mild and go away on their own. However, if they persist or get worse, it may be time to seek veterinary care. It's important to remember that pets are unable to verbally communicate with us when they're not feeling well. As their owner, it's up to us to watch for any changes in behavior or physical symptoms. This can be especially important in older pets, who may be more prone to health issues. If you do decide to seek veterinary care for your pet, be sure to share as much information as possible with the veterinarian. This can include details about when the symptoms started, how severe they are, and any changes in behavior you may have noticed. Remember, the earlier you catch health issues in your pets, the easier they are to treat.

It's also a good idea to consult with friends, family, and co-workers who have taken a cruise in the past. Ask them about their experiences, what they liked and didn't like, and which cruise line they would recommend. They can provide valuable firsthand knowledge and give you unbiased opinions. Another way to compare cruise lines is to take a look at their itineraries and onboard amenities. Do they offer the destinations you want to visit? Do they have the onboard activities and entertainment you enjoy? Are the dining options satisfactory? These are all important factors to consider when choosing a cruise line. Additionally, consider the size of the ship and the number of passengers. Some people prefer a more intimate experience with fewer passengers, while others enjoy the larger ships with more amenities and entertainment options. Ultimately, the best way to choose a cruise line is to do your research and compare your options. Take the time to read reviews, talk to past passengers, and consider your own preferences and needs. With the right preparation, you can find the perfect cruise line for your dream vacation."},{"prompt":"Does the sentence Many rodents such as voles live underground. answer the question Where do many rodents live?

First, give your dog more exercise. Physical activity, such as going for walks or playing fetch in the park, can be a great way to reduce boredom and anxiety. It can also help your dog to expend energy and feel more content. Consider teaching your dog some new tricks.

It's important to address the root cause of the problem, rather than simply trying to silence your dog.

Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted all 11 of its major languages official status), which was seen by them as a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation. Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system. Some other languages have received semiofficial recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. It is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools, and English language is a compulsory subject. As in other postcolonial African societies, the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school dropouts and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low.

Here are some steps you should take to ensure that you receive the best possible care: 1. Make a follow-up appointment with your doctor. If you’ve received abnormal results from a test or examination, the first thing you should do is to schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor.

If you’ve received abnormal test results related to cervical cancer or other HPV-related conditions, your doctor may recommend that you get an HPV test.

Depending on the condition being monitored, this may involve periodic check-ups or follow-up tests to monitor any changes. 5. Discuss hormonal causes.

The match was evenly contested, with both teams creating their fair share of chances. However, it was Southampton who dominated the first half, with QPR struggling to keep up. Despite their superiority, the first half ended goalless. Harry Redknapp's side showed great resilience, defending resolutely and frustrating Southampton's attackers. But the hosts eventually broke through the QPR defense, with Ryan Bertrand scoring his first goal for the club after joining on loan from Chelsea. QPR, however, were not deterred by going behind and found the equalizer through Charlie Austin. The striker finished with aplomb, leaving Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster with no chance. At this point, the game was nicely poised, and it could have gone either way. However, it was Southampton who emerged victorious, thanks to Pelle's stunning goal. The Italian striker received the ball inside the box and showed great composure to finish from close range with a powerful strike. The goal was a testament to Pelle's quality and it was enough to ensure that Ronald Koeman's side claimed all three points. The win was Southampton's third of the season and it moves them up to fourth place in the Premier League table. The Saints have built a reputation for being a difficult team to beat under Koeman, and this result continues to cement their place as one of the league's most impressive sides. Overall, the match was an entertaining encounter, with both sides contributing to an evenly contested game.

It turns out that Pollard was actually using the car to help career criminal Daryl Kennedy in his illegal activities. Kennedy paid Pollard £100 each time she chauffeured him to a target, which ended up being 46 raids in Cheshire. Pollard's illegal activities reached their height on Christmas Eve of last year, when she drove Kennedy to 14 different homes. It's a shocking revelation, and it has led many to wonder how Pollard went from being a seemingly law-abiding citizen to someone who was actively helping a criminal. Of course, this isn't the first time that people have used rented cars for illegal activities. Criminals have been known to rent cars to use them in robberies, or to transport illegal materials. But Pollard's actions are particularly egregious, given that she used the car she rented for her disabled mother for these illegal activities. Pollard has since been arrested and charged with assisting Kennedy in his crimes. It remains to be seen what her defense will be, or whether she will plead guilty.

Before the first snowfall, it's essential to carry out some maintenance checks to ensure your vehicle is in excellent condition. Here are some winter car maintenance tips to help you prepare for the season: 1. Check your tire pressure - Properly inflated tires provide better traction, handling, and control when driving on snowy or wet roads. Make sure to check the pressure regularly since it drops faster in colder temperatures. 2. Check your actual tires - Inspect the condition of your tires to make sure they can handle winter driving. If the treads are worn down or showing signs of damage, it's essential to replace them before the snow starts falling. 3. Swap your regular tires for snow tires if you have any - Snow tires are designed to improve traction, which is essential when driving on snowy roads. If you live in an area with severe winter conditions, snow tires are a must-have. 4. Replace windshield wiper blades - Visibility is crucial when driving in the winter. Torn or worn-out wipers can reduce visibility, leading to accidents. Replace them before winter. 5. Inspect your coolant system - Your vehicle's coolant system ensures that the engine doesn't overheat or freeze. Make sure it is in good condition and that the coolant is at the right level. 6. Assess the condition of your battery - A weak battery can leave you stranded in the cold. Check the battery's condition and replace it if it's more than three years old. 7. Arrange a servicing for your vehicle - If you're unsure about how to check your vehicle's condition or don't have the time, taking it to a mechanic for servicing is your best bet. 8.

In this respect it is notable that the Umayyad caliphs referred to themselves not as khalifat rasul Allah (successor of the messenger of God, the title preferred by the tradition), but rather as khalifat Allah (deputy of God). The distinction seems to indicate that the Umayyads regarded themselves as God's representatives at the head of the community and saw no need to share their religious power with, or delegate it to, the emergent class of religious scholars. In fact, it was precisely this class of scholars, based largely in Iraq, that was responsible for collecting and recording the traditions that form the primary source material for the history of the Umayyad period. In reconstructing this history, therefore, it is necessary to rely mainly on sources, such as the histories of Tabari and Baladhuri, that were written in the Abbasid court at Baghdad.

However, the house would also come with a hefty stamp duty bill of £2.1 million, which is higher than the average corporation tax that Google has paid in recent years. According to reports, Google has generated over £12 billion in revenue in the UK between 2006 and 2011. During that period, the internet giant paid just £10.6 million in corporation tax, which has caused controversy and criticism from some people who believe the company is not paying its fair share. Despite this criticism, Smidt has reportedly appointed Thomas Van Straubenzee from estate agent VanHan to help him find his new London home. While the search may be exciting for Smidt, it has highlighted the ongoing debate about tax avoidance by multinational corporations. In conclusion, while Smidt's search for a new luxury property may be a personal matter, the tax implications related to his purchase have sparked important questions about the responsibilities of multinational companies to contribute appropriately to the economies in which they operate."},{"prompt":"Ask a question about Internet service provider.","completion":"What are the best Internet service providers in my area?"},{"prompt":"Then we get out of the drive thru and I hear this noise yet again only this time it is getting louder and closer to me .

Keep the speaker away from obstructions. Calculate the current. Adjust the frequency to find the resonance peak. Calculate the impedance at resonance. Calculate impedance for other frequencies.","completion":"To create a sine wave and analyze its impedance, you will need a few tools: a signal generator that can produce a sine wave, an amplifier, a resistor, and a speaker. Once you have everything ready, follow the steps below. First, get a tool that generates a sine wave signal. Connect the tool to the input of your amplifier, and set the amp to a low voltage to prevent damage to your equipment. Then, choose a high-value resistor and measure its exact resistance using a multimeter. Next, connect the resistor and speaker in series, making sure to keep the speaker away from any obstructions. Calculate the current by dividing the voltage across the resistor by the resistance of the resistor. Now, adjust the frequency of the sine wave generator to find the resonance peak. This is the frequency at which the impedance of the speaker and resistor combination is maximum. Calculate the impedance at resonance by dividing the voltage across the resistor by the current you just calculated. Finally, calculate the impedance for other frequencies by adjusting the frequency of the sine wave generator and repeating the process above. By doing so, you can create an impedance curve that shows how the impedance of the circuit changes with frequency. Overall, measuring impedance can be a useful tool in understanding the behavior of electrical circuits. By following these steps, you can create a simple circuit to analyze the impedance of a speaker and resistor combination."},{"prompt":"Write a sentence that about [The Wrestlers food Indian; The Wrestlers priceRange less than £20; The Wrestlers customer rating low; The Wrestlers familyFriendly yes].","completion":"\\"The Wrestlers serves Indian food for less than £20 with a low customer rating, but it is still a family-friendly restaurant.\\""},{"prompt":"This movie is perfect for families to watch together.

However, being too hesitant or passive can often result in items being lost or forgotten. So, what can we do to ensure we get our belongings back? Firstly, it's important to be forward about asking for the item back. Waiting for them to offer or hoping they'll remember isn't always the most effective approach. Instead, politely but confidently ask for the item to be returned to you as soon as possible. If the person seems forgetful or disorganized, asking a direct question about the item can be helpful. For example, \\"Have you had a chance to find my book? I'm really looking forward to reading it again.\\" This will likely prompt them to search for the item or put it at the forefront of their mind. Sending a message regarding the item can also be effective. In today's world of constant communication, a quick text or email can serve as a reminder without being confrontational. An example email could be, \\"Hey there, just wanted to check in and see if you happened to come across my necklace. Let me know!\\" Finally, don't be afraid to bring it up on multiple occasions. If the person still hasn't returned the item, it's okay to bring it up again in a subtle way. For example, \\"Just wanted to check in about that book again. I'd love to get it back if you have a chance to find it.\\" Overall, being proactive and direct is key when it comes to ensuring your personal belongings are returned to you.

Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.
