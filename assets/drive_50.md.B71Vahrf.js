The answer to this question lies in the final moments of the game, where the team that was trailing managed to stage a dramatic comeback. As the clock wound down, team A was leading by a score of 24-21, and it appeared that they were on their way to victory. However, team B had different plans, and they mounted a ferocious drive down the field that culminated in a touchdown. The player who scored the final touchdown of the game was none other than the team B's running back, John Smith. Smith had been instrumental in driving the ball down the field during the final moments of the game, and he was able to find the endzone on a 10-yard rush up the middle. Smith's touchdown was not only the game-winner, but it was also his third touchdown of the game. He had been a standout performer throughout the match, racking up over 100 yards rushing and proving to be a difficult player for team A to contain.

The answer to this question is a matter of debate, as there are several quarterbacks who have thrown impressive long touchdown passes throughout the history of the NFL. According to the official NFL record books, the longest touchdown pass in NFL history was thrown by a Chicago Bears quarterback named Ed Brown in 1951. Brown's pass traveled an incredible distance of 99 yards and was caught by his teammate Bill Wightkin for a touchdown. However, some football fans and experts argue that there have been longer touchdown passes thrown in exhibition games, college football, or other non-NFL leagues. In fact, some sports historians have documented touchdown passes that traveled over 100 yards! However, these records are not officially recognized by the NFL or its governing body. Other notable long touchdown passes in NFL history include a 98-yard pass by Tom Brady to Wesley Welker, a 97-yard pass by Brett Favre to Robert Brooks, and a 96-yard pass by Eli Manning to Victor Cruz. These plays all required incredible arm strength, accuracy, and timing from the quarterbacks involved. Despite the impressive feats of these quarterbacks, it's worth noting that a long touchdown pass is always a team effort. The quarterback needs to have time to throw the ball, the receiver needs to run the right route and make the catch, and the offensive line needs to block effectively. Without each of these important elements working in concert, a long touchdown pass can be difficult if not impossible to achieve. In conclusion, the answer to the question of who threw the longest touchdown pass in history is somewhat subjective. Officially, the record belongs to Ed Brown of the Chicago Bears. However, there have been other impressive long touchdown passes throughout NFL history, each of which required incredible skill and teamwork from the players involved."},{"prompt":"feels like forever since I ' ve posted here .

The first step is to choose a grout stain that complements your tile color and style. There are many different options available, including classic shades like white and gray or more modern colors like blue or green. Be sure to choose a stain that is appropriate for your specific type of grout. Once you have your stain, the next step is to thoroughly clean your tile and grout. This is important to remove any dirt, grime, or debris that could interfere with the stain adhering properly. You can use a commercial tile and grout cleaner or make your own with a mixture of vinegar and baking soda. After cleaning, allow the grout to dry completely before applying the stain. Follow the instructions on the stain package, which will typically include using a small brush or applicator to spread the stain over the grout lines. Be careful not to get any stain on the tile itself, as it can be difficult to remove. Depending on the color and coverage you want to achieve, you may need to add additional coats of stain. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. Finally, once you are satisfied with the color and coverage of your grout stain, it is important to seal the grout to protect it from future staining or damage. There are many different grout sealers available, including spray-on or brush-on options. You can also choose between a natural or glossy finish. By following these simple steps, you can easily stain and seal your grout to give your tile floors a beautiful new look that will last for years to come."},{"prompt":"This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close.

The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a waterdeposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands.

Detangle the ends of the wig with your fingers and a widetooth comb. Use a detangling spray or lotion. Comb the sprayed wig gently. Use diluted fabric softener if you don't have a detangling product.","completion":"Wigs are a popular accessory for people wanting to change their hairstyle without committing to a permanent cut or color. However, maintaining the quality and lifespan of a wig can be a challenge, particularly when it comes to detangling. Thankfully, with the right tools and a few tips, you can easily detangle your wig and keep it looking its best. To begin, place the wig on a head or mannequin to keep it in place while you work. Next, start detangling the ends of the wig with your fingers and a wide-tooth comb, working your way up towards the roots. This helps to prevent any unnecessary pulling or damaging of the wig fibers. For added help, consider using a detangling product such as a spray or lotion to assist in the process. Simply spray or apply the lotion to the wig and gently comb through the strands. This will help to further loosen any knots or tangles, making it easier to comb through.

One of the key aspects of this is making sure that you are truly ready to let go of the person. This may seem like an obvious step, but sometimes we find ourselves holding on to a relationship even when we know it’s not right for us. Take the time to really think about your feelings and make sure that ending things is what you truly want. Another important aspect of a healthy breakup is refusing to manipulate the other person. This can take many forms, such as using guilt or making ultimatums. Not only is this unfair to the other person, but it can also be damaging to your own emotional well-being in the long run. Be honest and straightforward about your feelings and give the other person the respect they deserve. Stress is a common factor in many breakups. It’s important to recognize the ways that stress can impact your actions and emotions during this time. Practice self-care and find ways to manage your stress, such as exercise or talking to a trusted friend or therapist. This will help you approach the breakup with a clear and level head. Finally, closure is an important aspect of any ending. Make sure that you’ve processed your feelings and taken the time to say goodbye before moving on. Closure can take many forms, such as having a final conversation or simply taking time for yourself to reflect and heal. However you choose to approach it, recognize the importance of closure and give yourself the space to say goodbye. In summary, a healthy breakup involves being ready to let go, refusing to manipulate the person, managing stress, and finding closure. By approaching the end of a relationship with honesty and respect, you can move on in a healthy and positive way."},{"prompt":"What is the sentiment of the following tweet?

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Cash machine thefts have become a growing problem in the UK, with a tripling of incidents reported in the past year alone. The police have identified that 90% of these thefts are linked to Romanian immigrants. The rise in these thefts has also led to an increase in the cost of card fraud, which is expected to reach £400 million by the end of the year. In the first four months of 2013, there were 7,572 reported cash machine card thefts, compared to only 2,553 in the same period last year. This indicates a worrying trend of increasing thefts, which is set to continue unless action is taken. Many experts believe that the increase in cash machine thefts is due to the ease with which criminals can access cash and card information. This is compounded by the fact that many card users do not take sufficient precautions when using cash machines, making it easy for fraudsters to steal their information. The police have identified that a large proportion of these thefts are carried out by Romanian immigrants, highlighting the need for tighter controls on the movement of people and greater cooperation between national law enforcement agencies. The rise in cash machine thefts is not only damaging to those individuals affected, but is also having a wider economic impact, with the estimated cost of fraud set to reach £400 million by the end of the year. This underscores the need for individuals and businesses alike to take measures to protect themselves from card fraud and other forms of financial crime. In conclusion, the rise in cash machine thefts is a concerning trend which requires a collaborative effort from law enforcement agencies, financial institutions and individual cardholders to combat. Enhanced security measures, tighter controls on movement, and greater public awareness are all necessary steps to prevent further losses and ensure the security of our financial systems."},{"prompt":"Sentence: They want to leave the meeting.

To ensure that both you and your pet are living in a clean and healthy environment, it's important to establish a regular cleaning routine. The first step in establishing a cleaning routine is to clean up pet messes immediately. Whether it's a spill or an accident, it's crucial to get rid of the mess as soon as possible. This will not only prevent stains and odors from setting in but will also prevent the spread of bacteria and germs. Another important aspect of pet care is washing toys, bedding, and accessories regularly. These items can quickly accumulate dirt, hair, and bacteria, which can be harmful to you and your pet. By washing them at least once a week, you can keep them smelling fresh and clean. Keeping your pet well-groomed is another important part of pet care. Regular brushing, bathing, and trimming can help keep your pet's fur and skin healthy and clean. This will also help prevent mats and tangles from forming, which can be uncomfortable for your pet. Wiping your pet's paws before they come inside is also a simple yet effective way to keep your home clean. This will prevent dirt, mud, and other debris from being tracked inside, which can wreak havoc on your floors and carpets. Putting a washable cover on your furniture is another great way to keep your home clean. This will protect your furniture from pet hair, scratches, and accidents, while also providing a comfortable place for your pet to relax. Lastly, keeping the litter box clean is crucial for both your pet's health and your home's cleanliness. Regularly scooping out waste and replacing litter can help prevent odor and bacteria buildup. In conclusion, establishing a regular cleaning routine is essential for every pet owner. By cleaning up messes immediately, washing toys and bedding regularly, keeping your pet well-groomed, wiping paws before they come inside, putting a washable cover on furniture, and keeping the litter box clean, you can create a clean and healthy environment for both you and your pet."},{"prompt":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation? sndag den 23 november 2014","completion":"Sunday, November 23, 2014."},{"prompt":"Keywords: mushroom, olive, onion, pizza What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","completion":"I would like a pizza with mushrooms, olives, and onions as toppings."},{"prompt":"Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Inpremiseswhere,forvariousreasons,anoverallceilingcannotbeused,e.g.wheretemperatureisregulatedviathejoists(concretecoreactivation)orwheretherearelargeareasofglass,absorbentraftsareonewayofcreatingacceptableacousticenvironments.Theabsorbentacousticraftscanbedesignedasbafflesorhorizontallysuspendedunits.","completion":"Absorbent rafts are a solution in premises where an overall ceiling cannot be used, such as where temperature is regulated via the joists (concrete core activation) or where there are large areas of glass, for creating acceptable acoustic environments.

Mayes was reportedly enraged that Robinson was still on the streets months after breaking into her boardinghouse and assaulting her friend.

A recent survey conducted in Australia found that a staggering 85 percent of gay people have either experienced or witnessed homophobia while playing sports, or as spectators. The survey, which was completed by 2,500 Australians, also found that half of those surveyed had been the target of homophobic slurs, verbal threats, ongoing bullying, or exclusion from social groups. The experiences of Brennan Bastyovanszky, who was subjected to homophobic slurs when he joined a Sydney rugby team a decade ago, are unfortunately all too common. So ostracized was he that he didn't play rugby for four years. This kind of negativity and exclusion can have a deeply damaging impact on athletes and their sense of self-worth. The issue of homophobia in sports is a serious one and requires urgent attention. Sports organizations and governing bodies need to work together to create inclusive environments where everyone feels safe and welcome, regardless of their sexuality. This may involve implementing policies to punish players who engage in homophobic behavior, providing diversity training to coaches and officials, and working closely with LGBT+ advocacy groups to raise awareness and promote inclusivity. Ultimately, we need to recognize that sports should be a space for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. By taking action to address homophobia in sports, we can help ensure that athletes like Bastyovanszky are never again made to feel like outsiders in the world of sports.

She told police: Please don't let me go. Please don't Knight tells CNN her feelings about Ariel Castro's suicide. The past year, she says, has been overwhelming but amazing as hell","completion":"Michelle Knight, one of the survivors of the Cleveland captives' case, recently opened up about her ordeal in an interview with CNN. She revealed that when she was first rescued, she actually thought that the rescuers were burglars who had broken into the house. Her experience had conditioned her to expect the worst, and so she was hesitant to believe that help had finally arrived. Knight went on to share that her initial reaction was to plead with the police not to let her go, as she had been so conditioned to rely on her captor, Ariel Castro. Despite the crime and torture that he had inflicted upon her, Knight still felt a sense of attachment and dependence on Castro - a common experience among Stockholm syndrome victims. When asked about Castro's suicide in prison, Knight revealed that she didn't feel any ill will towards him. Rather, she felt sadness that he didn't have the opportunity to receive the help he so clearly needed. She pointed out that, while she was able to survive and heal from her trauma, Castro never received the support or therapy he needed to overcome his twisted desires and violent tendencies. Overall, Knight expressed that the past year had been \\"overwhelming but amazing as hell.\\" While she acknowledges the ongoing struggle of healing from such a traumatic experience, she also feels immense gratitude for being given a second chance at life. She has focused on writing, advocating for victims of abuse, and cherishing the relationships she has with her loved ones. In many ways, Knight's story is a reminder that resilience and hope can emerge from even the darkest of situations.

Beginning in the 11th century, the styles of writing employed were primarily the naskh, muhaqqaq, rayḥānī and, on rarer occasions, the thuluth script. Naskh was in very widespread use.

Allowing the stubble to grow to the ideal length will result in a smoother shave. Once you're ready to shave, begin by clearing your neck of any hair. This will help to define your jawline and give your face a clean, sharp look. Next, if desired, use your clippers to shape the hair just under your cheekbones. This can help to give your face a more structured appearance, which is particularly helpful if you have a rounder face shape. Remember to take your time and use steady, controlled movements. After you've finished shaving and shaping, it's important to refresh your face with a good face wash. This will help to remove any leftover hair and soothe your skin, leaving you feeling fresh and rejuvenated. Overall, with a little bit of patience and attention to detail, you can achieve a perfectly groomed look.

This significant increase started in the early 1980s when the United States shifted from a period of budget surpluses to budget deficits. The Reagan administration increased military spending while simultaneously cutting taxes, which led to a substantial increase in the national debt. Throughout the 1980s, the debt continued to climb, reaching 2.6 trillion by the end of the decade. The 1990s brought a brief period of budget surpluses, but the debt began to climb again in the late 1990s due to various factors, including increased spending on entitlements and defense, as well as tax cuts. By the end of 2000, the national debt had risen to 5.7 trillion. The early 2000s saw a continuation of tax cuts and increased spending on military operations overseas, resulting in an even higher national debt. By 2008, the debt had reached 10.6 trillion. The Great Recession of 2008 brought about a period of economic slowdown and reduced tax revenues, leading to an even greater increase in the national debt. By the end of 2019, the national debt had surpassed 23 trillion. In summary, it took approximately 12 years for the public debt to increase from 712 billion to 2.052 trillion.

The accumulation of dirt, oil, and residue from cosmetics and environmental pollutants can clog pores and lead to breakouts, dullness, and premature aging. A simple skincare routine can help you remove impurities and exfoliate dead skin cells that can interfere with your complexion's natural glow. The first step in any skincare routine is to cleanse your face. Use a gentle cleanser that is suitable for your skin type and make sure to remove any makeup or sunscreen before washing your face. Gently massage the cleanser onto your face in circular motions, paying close attention to your T-zone and areas prone to acne. Rinse with warm water and pat dry with a clean towel. Once you have a clean canvas, it's time to exfoliate. A gentle scrub can help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores, leaving your skin smoother and brighter. Choose a scrub with fine particles that won't irritate your skin or cause micro-tears. Apply a small amount of the scrub onto your fingertips and gently massage onto your face in a circular motion. Rinse with water and pat dry. After exfoliating, it's essential to restore the natural moisture balance of your skin. Apply a lightweight moisturizer that is suitable for your skin type to nourish and hydrate your skin. Gently massage the moisturizer onto your face, neck, and decolletage to provide a protective barrier against environmental stressors. Remember to repeat this routine every day, preferably before bedtime, to keep your skin healthy and radiant. Regular cleansing and exfoliating will remove impurities, promote collagen production, and improve cell turnover, thereby reducing the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines. In conclusion, cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing are essential steps to ensure healthy, radiant skin. Follow this simple skincare routine every day to remove impurities, unclog pores, and restore your skin's natural glow.

Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrelcage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its preWorld War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not selfstarting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a springloaded manually operated switch.

Check the lie of the golf ball.","completion":"Golf is a sport that requires a combination of strength, focus, and skill. One of the areas where players can improve their game is in putting. Putting is one of the most important aspects of golf, as it is the shot that finishes off a hole. To improve putting skills, players should practice with soft hands. Soft hands help to control the speed and direction of the ball. Another area that players can work on is chipping. When chipping, players should also use soft hands to help control the ball. Using soft hands can also help to prevent the ball from rolling too far past the hole. Additionally, players should pay attention to the lie of the golf ball. The lie of the ball can affect how the ball bounces and rolls, so it's important to take it into account when chipping. Finally, when pitching, players should use their arms to control the shot. Pitching with the arms helps to generate more power and accuracy in the shot. Additionally, players should also pay attention to the lie of the ball when pitching. By checking the lie of the ball, players can adjust their shot and make sure that it lands where they want it to. In conclusion, improving golf skills requires a combination of practice, patience, and attention to detail. By working on putting, chipping, and pitching skills, players can help to improve their overall game. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced golfer, these tips can help you improve your skills and make your time on the course more enjoyable."},{"prompt":"Data: name = The Golden Curry, eatType = restaurant, priceRange = moderate, familyFriendly = yes, near = The Bakers.

Gavin & Stacey was first shown on BBC3 in 2007 before moving to BBC1. Corporation hopes to save £50million a year by making channel online only. The money would be ploughed back into enhancing flagship channel BBC1.","completion":"BBC3 To Move Online, Maybe Losing Some Stars in the Process BBC3, the digital youth-focused channel known for hits like Gavin & Stacey and Little Britain, is set to move entirely online next year. The corporation aims to save £50m annually by transitioning the channel to be streamed only through iPlayer. The move has raised some concerns among BBC3’s stars, including Matt Lucas, who criticised the decision on social media. The shift to digital is driven by changing viewing habits as young people increasingly watch on-demand content through their mobiles and computers. In response, BBC3 will be moved to the iPlayer service from 2015, saving the corporation a significant amount of money as overheads like analogue signal costs will no longer be necessary. This follows the steady rise of online shows and streaming services, like Netflix, which have challenged the dominance of traditional television. According to James Corden, the creator and star of Gavin & Stacey, this move could actually benefit the channel by making it more accessible to younger viewers who are already comfortable with watching shows online. Meanwhile, BBC Director-General Tony Hall has argued that the savings from transitioning BBC3 would be used to boost the budget of the flagship channel BBC1, allowing it to create better shows and compete with other networks internationally. However, it is worth noting that BBC3’s programming could be negatively impacted by the move, as some of its stars may decide to move with the channel online, while others may choose to work with other channels instead. Despite these concerns, Hall is optimistic, stating that by moving BBC3 online, the corporation is embracing the future of television and investing in the next generation of viewers."},{"prompt":"Write the next sentence in the following story.
