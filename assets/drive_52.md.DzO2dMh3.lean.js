Cover the soil with a layer of mulch. Remove the mulch in early spring and divide the tubers.","completion":"Dahlias are beautiful plants often favored for their colorful, diverse blooms. If you live in a region that experiences mild winters, it is possible to overwinter your dahlias outdoors. However, this technique is only recommended for individuals who live in hardiness zones 7 to 10, where winter weather is not extreme. To overwinter your dahlias, begin by covering the soil around your plants with a layer of mulch. This will help insulate the roots and keep them warm throughout the winter. The mulch should be around two to three inches deep, but shouldn't touch the plants themselves as that can lead to rotting. Cedar or pine needles are good mulches to use. Once spring arrives, remove the mulch from the soil and start dividing the tubers. Dahlias are tuberous plants which means they have a rhizome-like structure underground that stores nutrients over winter. Every spring you should dig these tubers out of the ground and break them into smaller pieces to promote better growth. Be sure your tubers each have at least one bud on them for the coming season. By following these simple instructions, you can successfully overwinter your dahlias outdoors and enjoy their beauty for years to come."},{"prompt":"What is Kashmir issue?

By 1993 the US troops were augmented with Rangers and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from Pakistan. During a raid in downtown Mogadishu, US troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the Battle of Mogadishu. Eighteen American soldiers were killed, and a US television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob. Somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1,000–5,000 total casualties during the conflict. After much public disapproval, American forces were quickly withdrawn by President Bill Clinton. The incident profoundly affected US thinking about peacekeeping and intervention.

The concept of school choice introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original neighbourhood comprehensive model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting 'specialisation' whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child's interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a pseudomarket incentive to encourage better schools. This logic has underpinned the controversial league tables of school performance. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply unanswerable): What law disables parents full control over their child's education?","completion":"Unanswerable."},{"prompt":"Rarely, a sharply tilted uterus is due to a disease such as endometriosis, an infection or prior surgery. Although this may make it more challenging for the sperm to reach the egg, conception can still occur. A tipped uterus will usually right itself during the 10th to 12th week of pregnancy. Rarely (1 in 3000 to 8000 pregnancies) a tipped uterus will cause painful and difficult urination, and can cause severe urinary retention. Treatment for this condition (called \`\`incarcerated uterus'') includes manual anteversion of the uterus, and usually requires intermittent or continuous catheter drainage of the bladder until the problem is rectified or spontaneously resolves by the natural enlargement of the uterus, which brings it out of the tipped position. In addition to manual anteversion and bladder drainage, treatment of urinary retention due to retroverted uterus can require the use of a pessary, or even surgery, but often is as simple as having the pregnant mother sleep on her stomach for a day or two, to allow the retroverted uterus to move forward. Can we conclude that can a uterus change from retroverted to anteverted? OPTIONS: no ye","completion":"Yes. The article mentions that a tipped uterus will usually right itself during the 10th to 12th week of pregnancy, which means the uterus can change from retroverted (tipped) to anteverted (normal position)."},{"prompt":"(CNN What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"As an AI language model, I do not have access to current news articles or websites such as CNN.

They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain.

NEW: Syrian opposition appeals to alAssad's Alawite community. Hillary Clinton says alAssad's regime is illegitimate and going to fall A former top White House official warns that Syria is not like Libya.","completion":"Syrian Crisis: 55 People Killed, Opposition Appeals to Alawite Community On Sunday, 55 people were killed in Syria, according to opposition activists. The ongoing crisis in the country shows no signs of slowing down, and the Syrian opposition is now appealing to President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite community. Many fear that the ongoing crisis will escalate into a civil war, and with the increasing violence, it is becoming clearer that al-Assad's regime is illegitimate and going to fall. Hillary Clinton, the United States Secretary of State, has recently made a statement to this effect, warning that al-Assad's regime is losing its credibility in the international community. However, a former top White House official warns that Syria is not like Libya, and that intervention is not a simple solution. The situation in Syria is far more complex due to the religious and ethnic divides that exist in the country, and the opposition’s request to the Alawite community is another sign of this. The Alawites are a minority Shia sect who have historically held power in Syria. Al-Assad and his inner circle are Alawites, and the opposition’s appeal to the community is an attempt to show that their movement is not a threat to them. This demonstrates the complexity of the situation in Syria and the need for cautious diplomacy, especially considering the involvement of Russia and Iran, who have been strong allies of the Syrian regime. The international community must act cautiously and wisely in this situation, recognizing the complexity of the conflict and the need to avoid inflaming already volatile tensions. While the fall of al-Assad's regime is becoming increasingly inevitable, the transition to a new government must be carefully planned to ensure stability and unity in Syria."},{"prompt":"Answer this question.

For a 60watt 120volt lamp, the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually 22.8 inches (580 mm), and the filament diameter is 0.0018 inches (0.046 mm). The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil. The coiledcoil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and lightemitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source, while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return unanswerable): How long is a typical uncoiled tungsten filament for a 40watt bulb?","completion":"unanswerable"},{"prompt":"What concepts are described in the following sentence?

Reduce treats. Use your cat’s hunting instincts.","completion":"Cats are beloved pets for many people around the world. They are cherished for their independence, their soft fur, and their gentle purrs. But as much as we love our feline friends, it's important to remember that they have certain needs that must be met in order for them to live happy and healthy lives. This includes providing them with regular exercise, plenty of water, and entertainment. One of the most important things you can do for your cat is to exercise them regularly. This can be done in a number of ways, such as playing with toys, providing climbing structures, or even taking your cat for walks on a leash. Exercise not only helps keep your cat physically fit, but it also helps to keep them mentally stimulated and engaged. In addition to exercise, providing plenty of water is crucial for your cat's health. Cats are known for not drinking enough water, which can lead to a variety of health problems such as urinary tract infections or dehydration. Be sure to provide your cat with fresh, clean water at all times, and consider investing in a water fountain to encourage them to drink more. To keep your cat entertained, it's important to provide them with a variety of toys and activities. Cats love to play, and having access to things like scratching posts, laser pointers, and interactive toys can help keep them engaged and happy. You can also rotate their toys to keep things interesting and avoid boredom. Another important aspect of a cat's diet is the frequency of smaller meals. Cats are natural hunters and grazers, and they prefer to eat small amounts throughout the day rather than one or two larger meals. Consider offering your cat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day to help keep them satisfied and prevent overeating. While treats can be a great way to reward your cat for good behavior or just to make them feel special, it's important not to overdo it. Too many treats can lead to weight gain and other health problems, so be sure to limit your cat's treat intake and choose healthy options whenever possible. Finally, it's important to tap into your cat's natural hunting instincts. This can be done by providing them with toys that mimic prey or hiding food throughout the house for them to find. Not only will this keep your cat entertained and engaged, but it will also help them to feel more fulfilled and satisfied. In conclusion, there are many things you can do to help keep your cat healthy and happy. By providing regular exercise, plenty of water, entertainment, smaller meals, reduced treats, and opportunities to use their hunting instincts, you can help ensure that your cat lives a long and fulfilling life."},{"prompt":"Would the answer to the question What is the death toll of people dying from tuberculosis ? be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?

This activity can strengthen neural pathways, enhance memory retention, and increase overall mental capacity. It can also improve critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and general knowledge. Fiction, in particular, has been found to have an impact on emotional intelligence. When reading fiction, individuals are exposed to various characters' emotions and perspectives, which can help them develop empathy, compassion, and understanding towards others. Fiction can also teach readers to recognize emotional patterns and identify social cues in real-life situations. Aside from personal emotional growth, staying informed on current events through daily news reading is essential. It provides an understanding of the world's political, economic, and social climate. This knowledge can improve conversations and decision-making, as well as help individuals to be informed and active citizens.

Fortunately, there are many natural and effective ways to repel them without resorting to harmful chemicals. One simple method is to hang up a ziplock bag filled with water. Flies are known to be bothered by the reflection of light off the water, so they will avoid the area. Another option is to use lavender oil, which has a scent that flies dislike. You can put a few drops on a cloth or tissue and place it near doors and windows to keep flies away. Similarly, cloves and lemon also have a strong scent that repels flies. Slice a lemon and stick whole cloves into the flesh, then place the lemon in the area where you want to keep the flies away. Another idea is to make a lemongrass water spray to use as a natural repellent. Simply boil lemongrass in water, strain it, and put the resulting liquid in a spray bottle. Growing herbs and flowers that flies don't like is another great way to deter them from your outdoor space. Some examples of plants that flies dislike include basil, mint, and marigolds. You can also try laying out cucumber slices, which flies find unappealing. Overall, getting rid of flies naturally requires a little bit of effort, but it's worth it to be able to enjoy the great outdoors without pesky insects buzzing around.

Asking for help from friends, family, or healthcare professionals can make a significant difference in your success. There are also support groups and online communities that can provide you with the encouragement, motivation, and accountability you need to stay on the path of non-smoking. Secondly, spending more time with friends who do not smoke can make a significant difference. These friends may provide you with a sense of community or positive peer pressure that will make it easier for you to resist the temptation to smoke. Being around people who support your decision to quit smoking can make a considerable difference in staying smoke-free. Thirdly, you should not keep cigarettes around. If they are easily accessible, it can be challenging to avoid the temptation to smoke. Make sure to dispose of all cigarettes, lighters, and ashtrays. This will help to remove any potential triggers that could lead you back to smoking. Lastly, distracting your mind with productive activities is an excellent way to redirect your focus away from smoking. Whether it is working out, reading a book, or simply going for a walk, engaging in activities that require your attention and energy can help to alleviate feelings of anxiety or restlessness that may arise during the quitting process. In conclusion, quitting smoking can be challenging, but it is always worth the effort. By asking for help, spending time with nonsmoking friends, removing all cigarettes and distractions, and distracting your mind with productive activities, you can increase your chances of success on this journey.

The former Sheffield United player was jailed for five years in 2012 after being convicted of rape of a teenager in a Rhyl hotel room. Since his release, he has struggled to find a new club willing to sign him due to the stigma attached to his conviction. Recently, Evans made headlines after it was revealed that his former club, Sheffield United, had revoked their invitation to let him train with them. This triggered a response from Evans who claimed to have turned down an approach from associates. However, despite his claims, no other British club has expressed interest in signing him, further damaging his chances of returning to professional football. The reason for this appears to be Evans' attitude towards his conviction. The Welsh striker has shown little contrition for his actions, going so far as to write off the rape as 'infidelity'. This has understandably caused outrage amongst campaigners for victims of sexual assault, and many have called for football clubs to boycott Evans and refuse to sign him. While Evans may feel that he has served his time and should be allowed to move on with his life, the fact remains that his attitude towards his conviction has been callous and insensitive. Until he can show genuine remorse for his actions and take steps to make amends, it is unlikely that any football club will be willing to take the risk of signing him. Ultimately, it is a sad situation for all involved. However, it is important to remember that victims of sexual assault must always come first, and football clubs must be mindful of this when considering whether to sign players with a history of sexual violence."},{"prompt":"Write a dialog about anything you w","completion":"Customer: Hi, can you help me find a new laptop?

Collect your supplies. Position the locks for comfort while working.","completion":"Dreadlocks are a popular hairstyle that requires proper maintenance to keep them looking neat and clean. Retwisting is an essential aspect of dreadlock care, which involves separating the hair into sections and twisting them to maintain the locks. If you have dreadlocks and want to keep them looking fresh, it's important to know when they need to be retwisted, how to get your supplies together, and how to position the locks for comfort while working. The first step is to identify dreads in need of retwisting. Look for locks that have a loose or frizzy appearance. This is an indication that the hair has grown out and needs to be twisted back into place. You may also notice that some locks appear flat or have lost their round shape. This is another sign that the hair needs to be retwisted. Once you have identified the locks that need to be retwisted, it's time to gather your supplies. You will need a dreadlock shampoo or residue-free shampoo, a towel, a locking tool or crochet hook, and a firm hold gel or locking spray. You may also want to have some clips on hand to help keep the hair separated while you work. When you have all your supplies together, it's time to position the locks for comfort while working. It's best to work on dry hair, so after washing your locks, use a towel to gently squeeze out excess water. You can use clips to separate the hair into sections to make it easier to work on one area at a time. Be sure to sit in a comfortable position, so you don't strain your back or neck while working. To retwist the locks, take a small section of hair and apply a small amount of gel or spray. Use the locking tool or crochet hook to twist the hair back into place. If the hair is not tightly twisted, it will become frizzy, so be sure to twist it firmly. Repeat this process on each section of hair until all the locks have been retwisted. In conclusion, retwisting is a vital aspect of dreadlock care, which helps maintain the shape and appearance of the hair. To retwist your dreadlocks, first, identify the locks that need to be retwisted. Then, gather your supplies, including shampoo, a towel, a locking tool, and a firm hold gel or locking spray. Finally, position the locks for comfort while working, and twist each section of hair firmly to keep your locks looking their best."},{"prompt":"Write a sentence that is about a restaurant with all the following properties: name = The Plough, eatType = pub, food = Japanese, priceRange = less than £20, familyFriendly = yes, near = Café Rouge","completion":"The Plough is a family-friendly pub that serves Japanese cuisine for less than £20 and is located near Café Rouge."},{"prompt":"ere is a question about this article: As with the rest of the UK, Southampton experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb).

Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place.

The research will fuel criticism of wind farms.","completion":"A recent study of nearly 3,000 turbines in Britain has cast doubt on the claims made by manufacturers regarding the lifespan of wind turbines. These findings will add further fuel to the criticism surrounding wind farms. Wind turbines have been touted as a clean and renewable source of energy. However, this study suggests that the reality may not be as appealing as its promoters have suggested. Manufacturers have long claimed that wind turbines can generate clean energy for a period of up to 25 years. However, this research has found that the average lifespan of wind turbines in Britain is only 12 to 15 years. The issue here is not just that the turbines are not lasting as long as anticipated. The problem is that, after reaching the end of their serviceable life, the turbines must be taken apart and replaced. This process is not only expensive, but it also generates waste that is difficult to dispose of safely. Critics of wind farms have long complained that they are an eyesore and that they are not reliable sources of energy. This new study reinforces these views. In addition, it highlights the fact that wind turbines have an environmental impact beyond just the production of electricity. Despite the criticisms, the UK government has been actively promoting the use of wind energy as part of its plans to reduce carbon emissions. However, the findings of this study may force policymakers to reevaluate their priorities. In conclusion, this study underscores the need for more research into the true lifespan of wind turbines, as well as the environmental impact of decommissioning and replacing them. It also raises important questions about the viability of relying on wind energy as a long-term solution to the energy crisis."},{"prompt":"Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Guitar<br>Tim loved to play the guitar.

This has come as a hard hit for those two employees who have lost their jobs just to keep the company afloat. The act of Oates pocketing such a large sum of money has sparked a debate on the ethics of such financial decisions. In times of economic hardship, should someone in a firm be allowed to take such a large sum of money for themselves? Is it fair to the other employees who are struggling with salary cuts and job losses? The answer to these questions is not a clear cut one. Some argue that people who work hard and contribute to the success of a company should be rewarded for their efforts. However, others feel that in times of financial difficulty, it is the responsibility of everyone in the company to make sacrifices.

During his time in the league, Lindell was known for his accuracy and consistency in making field goals. To determine how many yards the mean value measure across Lindell's first three field goals, we need to look at some statistics. Fortunately, Lindell was a prolific kicker and his game logs are readily available. During his first three field goal attempts as a professional football player, Lindell made kicks from a distance of 21 yards, 32 yards, and 45 yards. To find the mean value of these three kicks, we add up the distances and divide by the total number of kicks. So, 21 yards + 32 yards + 45 yards = 98 yards. Dividing 98 yards by three (the total number of kicks) gives us a mean value of 32.67 yards per kick. Therefore, the mean value measure across Rian Lindell's first three field goals is 32.67 yards. This means that on average, Lindell's first three field goals were kicked from a distance of 32.67 yards. As a kicker, Lindell's consistency and accuracy were critical to the success of his team. Knowing the mean value of his first three kicks can give fans and analysts an idea of his ability and performance early in his career.

However, a good rule of thumb is to begin by doing the simple cleaning tasks first. This can make the entire process feel less daunting and help you establish a cleaning routine that works for you. Simple cleaning tasks can include things like decluttering and organizing, wiping down surfaces and appliances, and taking out the garbage. By completing these tasks first, you can create a clear and tidy space to work in, which can make more complex cleaning tasks feel more manageable. Another benefit of starting with simple cleaning tasks is that they often take less time and require fewer supplies. This means you can quickly knock them out and move on to other tasks or take a break if needed. It can also help build momentum and motivation for tackling more challenging cleaning tasks. While simple cleaning tasks may seem basic, they can have a significant impact on the overall cleanliness of your home. By consistently decluttering surfaces and investing time in organizing, you can reduce the amount of dust and dirt that accumulates in your home. Wiping down surfaces and appliances regularly can also prevent the buildup of bacteria and germs. In summary, starting with simple cleaning tasks can make the process of cleaning less overwhelming, establish a routine, and have a significant impact on the overall cleanliness of your home.

Knowing when to use \\"Reply\\" and \\"Reply All\\" seems like a basic skill, but it can make a huge difference in the workplace. It's important to consider whether everyone in the original email chain needs to be included in your response. Being mindful of this can help prevent cluttered inboxes and unnecessary notifications. Another important concept to grasp is the difference between Bcc and Cc. Bcc, or Blind Carbon Copy, allows you to send an email to multiple recipients without them knowing who else received it. This is useful when you need to share information with a group of people, but you don't want to reveal everyone's email address. Cc, or Carbon Copy, sends a copy of the email to additional recipients, but everyone can see who else received it. Understanding when to use each option can greatly improve your email etiquette. While email is a convenient way to communicate, there are times when a phone call may be better. Email can provide a written record of the conversation, but sometimes tone and intention can be lost in translation. Speaking to someone directly can help avoid misunderstandings, build relationships, and resolve issues more efficiently. Lastly, knowing when to start a new conversation is vital. If an email thread has gone off-topic, or a new issue has been introduced, it's time to start a new conversation with a new email subject line. This helps keep information organized and easily searchable, making it easier for everyone to find what they need. In conclusion, to be a successful communicator in today's world, you must be proficient in various messaging and emailing tools. Being mindful of when to use \\"Reply\\" and \\"Reply All,\\" understanding the difference between Bcc and Cc, recognizing when a phone call may be better, and knowing when to start a new conversation can make a significant difference in your daily interactions.

This not only keeps the game going but also provides something tangible to bet with. Lastly, to make the experience more intimate, try playing heads-up with your lover. This can be a fun and unique way to deepen your connection and add a little fun to your romantic life. It’s important to note that playing strip poker, or any other variation of the game, should always be consensual and respectful.

Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with throughhole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates. Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about onequarter to onetenth of the size and weight of throughhole components, and passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor surface mount devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages. Some wireended components, such as 1N4148 smallsignal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents. Please answer a question about this article.

Obama stated that the United States shouldn't put \\"another barrier\\" on medical workers who are already risking their lives to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Many view Obama's comments as a veiled criticism of the governors' actions. The mandatory quarantines were put in place in response to the increasing Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people. The governors of New Jersey and New York argued that the mandatory quarantines were necessary to protect the public from the possibility of an Ebola outbreak in the United States. However, Obama's comments suggest that the mandatory quarantines may not be the best approach to combatting the outbreak. While the risk of Ebola spreading to the United States is a serious concern, medical workers who are fighting the outbreak in Africa are also at risk and should not face additional barriers to returning home. The debate over how to best combat the Ebola outbreak highlights the delicate balance between protecting public health and respecting the rights of medical workers who are putting their lives on the line to help others.
