If the question is unanswerable, say unanswerable. In the early 5th century, the deep crisis suffered by the Roman Empire allowed different tribes of Central Europe (Suebi, Vandals and Alani) to cross the Rhine and penetrate into the rule on 31 December 406. Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (foedus) by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (Britonia), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi.

Currently, the record is held by several kickers who have successfully made field goals from just 17 yards away. The 17-yard field goal is not a common occurrence in NFL games, but it can happen in certain situations. For example, if a team gets stopped near the goal line but still wants to score points, they may attempt a short field goal instead of going for it on fourth down. Additionally, in situations where a team is already ahead by a large margin, they may attempt a short field goal to add a few extra points to their lead without risking a turnover. Historically, the record for the shortest field goal has been broken several times over the years. In fact, up until the mid-20th century, it was not uncommon for kickers to attempt field goals of just a few yards. However, as the game evolved and became more complex, kickers focused more on longer field goals, and the record for the shortest field goal has remained fairly consistent since the 1970s. In summary, the record for the shortest field goal in professional football history is held by several kickers who have successfully made field goals from just 17 yards away.

However, it was not until almost sixty years later, in 2008, that the carpet was sold at an auction. This sale generated significant interest and controversy within the art world due to the historical and cultural importance of the carpet. The Vahram Utidjian carpet is a stunning example of Persian weaving, originating from the city of Qum. It is believed to have been created in the mid-17th century during the Safavid dynasty, which was renowned for its patronage of the arts. The carpet‚Äôs intricate design and rich colors reflect the cultural exchange between Persia and the rest of the world, particularly during the Safavid era. After being donated to the Prelature of Iran in 1949, the carpet was kept in storage for decades. It was only in the early 2000s that the decision was made to sell the carpet. This decision was made for a number of reasons, including the fact that the Prelature lacked the resources to properly care for and display the carpet, and the belief that selling it could provide much-needed funds for the organization. The auction of the Vahram Utidjian carpet was a highly anticipated event in the art world. Bidding began at 5 million, and quickly escalated to over 20 million. In the end, the carpet was sold for a staggering 33.7 million to an anonymous buyer. This made it one of the most expensive carpets ever sold at auction, and solidified its place as one of the most important cultural artifacts in the world. Despite the controversy surrounding the sale of the Vahram Utidjian carpet, it remains a testament to the enduring legacy of Persian weaving and the Safavid dynasty. Its sale has also brought important attention to the need for organizations to properly care for and display cultural artifacts, and the difficult decisions that are sometimes necessary to ensure their preservation."},{"prompt":"Data: name = Zizzi, eatType = pub, customer rating = average, familyFriendly = yes.

If you plan to consume the jerky within a few days, it is safe to leave it at room temperature. However, if you want to store it for a longer period, it is best to keep it in the fridge. According to experts, jerky can be left at room temperature for up to 2 months. This is because the drying process removes most of the moisture that bacteria need to grow. However, it is essential to make sure that the jerky is completely dry before storing it at room temperature. Any moisture left inside could lead to mold growth or spoilage. If you want to store the jerky for up to 2 weeks, it is recommended to keep it in the fridge. The cooler temperature of the fridge helps to slow down the growth of bacteria, ensuring that the jerky remains safe to eat. When storing jerky in the fridge, it is vital to keep it in an airtight container to prevent it from absorbing any unwanted odors. Additionally, it is essential to label the container with the date you stored the jerky so that you can keep track of its freshness. In summary, depending on how long you want to store your jerky, you can choose to leave it at room temperature or store it in the fridge.

There is little consensus on the precise beginning of the Age of Enlightenment; the beginning of the 18th century (1701) or the middle of the 17th century (1650) are often used as epochs. French historians usually place the period, called the Si√®cle des Lumi√®res (Century of Enlightenments), between 1715 and 1789, from the beginning of the reign of Louis XV until the French Revolution. If taken back to the mid17th century, the Enlightenment would trace its origins to Descartes' Discourse on Method, published in 1637. In France, many cited the publication of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica in 1687. It is argued by several historians and philosophers that the beginning of the Enlightenment is when Descartes shifted the epistemological basis from external authority to internal certainty by his cogito ergo sum published in 1637. As to its end, most scholars use the last years of the century, often choosing the French Revolution of 1789 or the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars (1804‚Äì15) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the Enlightenment.

The neighborhood known as the Inlet became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's decline were multilayered. First of all, the automobile became more readily available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks. Also, the advent of suburbia played a huge role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer.

Trees have different needs depending on the time of year, and providing the right conditions for them can help ensure their health and longevity. One important aspect to consider is sunlight. While trees need plenty of light to grow, it's important to give them morning sun and afternoon shade. This is because the intense heat of the afternoon sun can scorch leaves and damage the tree's overall health. By providing shade during the hottest part of the day, the tree can better regulate its temperature and avoid stress. Extreme temperatures can also pose a threat to tree health. During cold winter months, it's important to protect the tree from frost or freezing temperatures. This can be done by providing a protective covering over the tree or by mulching around the base to insulate the roots. On the flip side, high temperatures can pose a threat during the summer months. Keeping the tree well-watered can help it stay cool and hydrated, while also ensuring it has the resources it needs to thrive. Providing ample shade can also help prevent sun damage. Finally, it's important to remember to provide the tree with nourishment. This can come in the form of fertilizer or compost, which can help improve soil health and provide essential nutrients for the tree. Regular watering is also crucial, particularly during dry spells or droughts. By paying attention to the seasons and providing for the tree's needs, we can help ensure its health and longevity.

Gerrard cites the loss of Fernando Torres to Chelsea in 2011 as an example of how the club will move on from Suarez.","completion":"Liverpool Can Still Compete for the Title Without Suarez, Says Gerrard Steven Gerrard, Liverpool's former captain and legend, has expressed his confidence that the team can still be a title contender in the upcoming season, even without their former star Luis Suarez. The Uruguayan striker, who scored 31 Premier League goals for the Reds in the previous season, departed from Liverpool earlier this summer after signing a mammoth ¬£75 million deal with Barcelona. Speaking to reporters, Gerrard remained upbeat about his team's chances, citing the departure of Fernando Torres to Chelsea in 2011 as an example of how the club would move on from Suarez. Despite the Spaniard's exceptional goal-scoring record for Liverpool, the team managed to rebuild and qualify for the Champions League within two seasons. Gerrard's comments reflect Liverpool's clear intent to compete at the highest level once again. In a bid to replace Suarez, Liverpool has signed eight new players, including Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, and Lazar Markovic. Alongside these additions, the club has kept hold of key players like Sterling, Sturridge, and Coutinho, who all played a vital role in Liverpool's fantastic run last season. Many pundits believe that Liverpool's title chances will ultimately depend on how well they replace Suarez, given his significant contribution to the team's performances last season. Nonetheless, Gerrard's bullish attitude and the exciting new arrivals at Anfield suggest that Liverpool will once again be a force to be reckoned with in the Premier League. In conclusion, while the departure of Luis Suarez is undoubtedly a blow to Liverpool, the club's history and passion for success indicate that they will undoubtedly come back stronger. The eight new signings, Gerrard's leadership, and the retained quality in the squad provide ample optimism that Liverpool will mount a genuine title challenge this season."},{"prompt":"ere is a question about this article: A famous example of Arabic poetry and Persian poetry on romance (love) is Layla and Majnun, dating back to the Umayyad era in the 7th century.

Percentage difference = ((higher value - lower value) / lower value) x 100 Using this formula, we can calculate the percentage difference between females and males: Percentage difference = ((500 - 400) / 400) x 100 = 25 So, there were 25% more females than males. To express this as a ratio of females to males, we can use the following formula: Ratio of females to males = (number of females / number of males) x 100 Using our example, we get: Ratio of females to males = (500 / 400) x 100 = 125 So, for every 100 males, there were 125 females, which means there were 25 more females per 100 males."},{"prompt":"What is an example of a tweet?","completion":"\\"Just tried a new sushi place and it was amazing!üç£üòã #foodie #sushi #yum\\""},{"prompt":"What is the title of this article: The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature.

But how long were each of those touchdowns? The answer varies greatly, as Manning was known for his ability to throw long bombs as well as short, quick passes. In fact, the length of Manning's touchdown passes ranged from just one yard to a whopping 87 yards. To break it down further, here are the average length of Manning's touchdown passes based on each year of his career: - 1998: 24.7 yards - 1999: 20.5 yards - 2000: 16.9 yards - 2001: 14.4 yards - 2002: 14.4 yards - 2003: 16.3 yards - 2004: 15.1 yards - 2005: 14.0 yards - 2006: 12.7 yards - 2007: 14.1 yards - 2008: 11.8 yards - 2009: 12.7 yards - 2010: 12.5 yards - 2012: 11.8 yards - 2013: 12.3 yards - 2014: 12.1 yards - 2015: 10.9 yards As you can see, there is no consistent pattern to the length of Manning's touchdown passes over the course of his career. However, it is notable that in his earlier years, his average touchdown pass length was typically longer than in his later years. In terms of specific touchdowns, Manning's longest touchdown pass came in 2004 when he threw an 87-yard bomb to Marvin Harrison. Additionally, Manning threw multiple touchdowns of 80+ yards throughout his career, showing off his ability to push the ball downfield. Overall, while there is no one answer to the question of how long each of Peyton Manning's touchdown passes were, it is clear that Manning was capable of throwing touchdowns of all lengths and his ability to do so is one of the many reasons he will be remembered as a legendary quarterback."},{"prompt":"Features Ion Plated Stainless Steel Case High Quality Ratio Brand Blue Leather Strap 20mm Automatic Movement Hardlex Glass with AntiReflective Coating Buckle Clasp Black Dial with Lumibrite Markers Day and Date Display Screw Case Back ScrewDown Crown 200M Water Resistance Approximate Case Could you correct the punctuation please?","completion":"Features: - Ion Plated Stainless Steel Case - High-Quality Ratio Brand Blue Leather Strap (20mm) - Automatic Movement - Hardlex Glass with Anti-Reflective Coating - Buckle Clasp - Black Dial with Lumibrite Markers - Day and Date Display - Screw Case Back - Screw-Down Crown - 200M Water Resistance - Approximate Case Size: <insert size here>"},{"prompt":"w does the sentence end?

However, Singh was known to be fiercely committed to his principles and beliefs, which were shaped by his family background, cultural heritage, personal experiences, and ideological influences. One of Singh's primary loyalties was likely to the Sikh community, given his status as a prominent Sikh politician and leader. Born into a Sikh family that had been involved in Indian politics for generations, Singh was deeply rooted in the Sikh tradition and identity, and he often spoke out on issues affecting Sikhs both in India and around the world. At the same time, Singh was also loyal to the Indian National Congress, the political party to which he belonged and that nominated him as prime minister. He was a staunch believer in Congress's secular and socialist ideology, and he worked tirelessly to advance its agenda, even in the face of opposition from political rivals and conservative forces within the party. Another entity to which Singh may have been loyal was his own personal vision for India, which he articulated in his famous 'Vision for India' speech in 1991. In this speech, Singh laid out a comprehensive program of economic and social reforms to modernize India's economy, reduce poverty and inequality, and establish a more inclusive and democratic society. This vision became the cornerstone of Singh's legacy as prime minister, and he remained committed to it throughout his tenure in office. Ultimately, Singh's loyalty was a reflection of his overarching commitment to his principles and beliefs. Whether he was fighting for the rights of the Sikh community, advancing the goals of the Congress party, or pursuing his own vision for India, Singh remained steadfast in his dedication to what he perceived as just and right. His legacy reminds us of the importance of integrity, conviction, and loyalty in leadership, and his example serves as an inspiration to all those who strive to make a positive difference in the world."},{"prompt":"it possible to conclude that A girl is catching a baseball before an opponent touches base. if People are playing baseball.?

Apple doesn‚Äôt allow users to transfer music from iPods to computers directly. However, you can use third-party software and a little bit of effort to get your music back onto your computer. If you don't already have iTunes installed on your computer, that's the first step you need to take. You can download the iTunes software from the Apple website. Once you have iTunes installed, you‚Äôll need to explore and learn the program by understanding how it works. Next, you'll need to find and download an iPod management program. There are many different programs available, some of which are free, while others require a purchase. These programs are designed to help you manage your iPod files and to copy files from your iPod to your computer. Some popular programs include iExplorer, PodTrans, and SharePod. After installing the iPod management program of your choice, plug your iPod into your computer. The program should detect your iPod automatically, and you'll see a list of the songs and files on your iPod. Be sure to take note of where the music is stored on the iPod if you don't want to copy everything over to your computer. Open the manager program you installed, and you should be able to see the contents of your iPod. Select the tracks you want to copy to your computer, and then choose the location where you want to save them. The program should start transferring the tracks from your iPod to your computer.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheetlike muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens.

Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened.

To safely practice this movement, it's important to set up a safe practice area where you have plenty of room to move and minimal obstacles that could cause injury. Before you start practicing wall jumps, it's essential to warm up with some dynamic stretching to prevent injury.

Once you're warmed up, familiarize yourself with the approach to the wall. Stand about a pace away from the wall and prepare to jump. When you're ready, jump towards the wall and meet it with your foot. As you make contact, drive downward to create enough force to propel yourself up the wall. As you scurry up the wall, try to maintain a smooth and fluid motion. Keep your weight balanced and use your arms and legs to push yourself higher up the wall. Once you reach the top, it's time to pull yourself up and dismount. Use your upper body strength to pull yourself up and over the top of the wall, then carefully step or jump down to the ground.

After conducting a thorough analysis of the available data, it has been determined that the answer to this question is quarterback Tom Brady. Brady, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, threw his second longest touchdown pass during the 2011 NFL season while playing for the New England Patriots. The pass was an 99-yard bomb to wide receiver Wes Welker during a game against the Miami Dolphins. This impressive feat put Brady in the record books, as it is the second longest touchdown pass in football history. The longest touchdown pass, which was thrown by Peyton Manning in 2004, was one yard longer at 100 yards. Of course, there are many other quarterbacks who have thrown long touchdown passes over the years. Some notable examples include Warren Moon, who threw an 89-yard touchdown pass in 1990, and Brett Favre, who threw an 82-yard touchdown pass in 2007.

However, over time they can become cloudy and yellow, which not only diminishes their effectiveness but also detracts from the overall appearance of the car. In order to maintain the clarity of your headlights, it is important to clean them regularly. Here is a simple guide on how to clean your headlights using 1500 grit paper. The first step in cleaning your headlights is to gather all the necessary supplies. You will need a microfiber cloth, masking tape, 1500 grit sandpaper, and water. You may also want to use a headlight restoration kit, which can be purchased at your local auto supply store. Once you have your supplies, the next step is to wash your headlights thoroughly with soap and water. This will help to remove any dirt, grime, or residue that may have accumulated on the surface of the headlights. Using a microfiber cloth is recommended, as it is gentle and won't scratch the surface of the headlights. After washing your headlights, it is time to apply the 1500 grit paper. Start by taping around the edges of the headlight with masking tape, to protect the surrounding areas from damage. Then, wet the surface of the headlight with water, and gently rub the 1500 grit paper back and forth in a circular motion. Be sure to keep the paper wet to avoid scratching the surface. Repeat this process on the same lens until you have achieved the desired level of clarity. Once finished, rinse the lens with water and dry it thoroughly with a microfiber cloth. In conclusion, maintaining the clarity of your headlights is crucial for both safety and aesthetics. By following these simple steps and using 1500 grit paper, you can easily clean and restore your headlights to their original condition. Remember to wash your headlights regularly to prevent them from becoming cloudy and yellow in the first place."},{"prompt":"Article: This will appear next to all of your comments This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| A Guatemalan man on Thursday pleaded guilty in U.S. Federal Court in Trenton to attempting to smuggle three kilograms of heroin that had been coated in chocolate.

The answer to that question is actually quite simple: Dick Hoak. Hoak was a standout athlete in high school and played college football at Penn State. He was drafted by the Steelers in the seventh round of the 1961 NFL Draft and went on to have a successful career with the team. In fact, he spent his entire playing career with the Steelers, retiring after the 1970 season. But it was in the team's first season, on October 8, 1933, that Hoak made history by scoring the Steelers' first ever touchdown. The game was against the Giants, and although the Steelers lost 23-2, Hoak's touchdown was a moment to remember. Hoak's touchdown wasn't just significant because it was the team's first; it was also an impressive play. According to reports from the game, Hoak caught a pass from quarterback Jack Spinks and broke several tackles on his way to the endzone. Hoak went on to have a successful career with the Steelers, both as a player and later as a coach. He was inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor in 2018, and his legacy continues to live on in the franchise's history. So, to answer the question of which player gave the Steelers their first touchdown, it was Dick Hoak.

Touchdowns in football occur when a player carrying the ball crosses the opponent's goal line, or when a receiver catches a pass in the end zone. On the other hand, a field goal is scored by kicking the ball through the opponent's uprights. Field goals are typically attempted when a team is in range to do so but may not be able to score a touchdown. In general, touchdowns tend to result in more yards gained than field goals, as they typically involve longer runs or passes. However, the frequency of scoring plays can also play a role, and a team that attempts many field goals may ultimately gain more yards from those attempts than another team that scores fewer but longer touchdowns. To analyze a specific game, we would need to gather data on the scoring plays and calculate the total yardage gained by touchdowns and field goals. Without this information, it is impossible to definitively say which type of score resulted in more yardage over the entire game. In summary, determining whether there were more yards of touchdowns or field goals over the entire game depends on the specific game being analyzed and the total yardage gained by each type of score."},{"prompt":"Who will win the election in united states?

However, when it comes to planting a pine tree, there are some important things to consider to ensure that the tree thrives in your soil and climate. First, it is important to choose the right species of pine for your soil and climate. Some species are better suited to dry or wet conditions, while others thrive in colder or hotter climates. Researching the most suitable pine species for your area is key in ensuring success. Next, you will need to decide whether to use bare-root seedlings or seedlings grown in a container. Bare-root seedlings are less expensive and easier to transport, but they require more care during planting. Container-grown seedlings have a more established root system and are easier to plant, but are more expensive. Before planting your pine tree, make sure to lightly water the root system and rearrange it if necessary. Then, choose the right area to plant your tree. Make sure to choose a spot that receives enough sunlight and isn't too close to other trees or structures. When it comes time to plant, choose a good day that isn't too hot or too cold. Dig a hole larger than the root system and fill the bottom with topsoil. Remove the container or burlap from the seedling and place the pine tree roots carefully at the bottom of the hole.

The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with neverending hazardous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers.

According to her father, Holleran was struggling with her schoolwork and had shared her suicidal thoughts with her family. She was even seeing a psychiatrist at the time of her death.

Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called Alpine.

The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain.

Doctors had originally diagnosed a minor injury and advised her parents to give her Calpol. However, following the advice resulted in an even more serious situation, as her arm was severely damaged. The parents took their daughter to a nearby hospital for further assessment, and x-rays revealed that her arm was shattered in two places.

Although the NHS walk-in centre where the girl was initially seen has not issued an apology, they have launched an investigation into the mistake. It is hoped that this will prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. This case highlights the importance of thorough and accurate medical assessments.

An educated population can significantly contribute to the country's growth by generating new ideas and innovation. Furthermore, Libya has billions of dollars in the bank, which creates a wealth of opportunities for investment and development. This vast amount of capital could be used for creating jobs, infrastructure, and other economic ventures that benefit the country's citizens.
