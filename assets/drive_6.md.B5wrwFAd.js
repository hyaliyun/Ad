Use reliable sources such as sports news websites, official team websites, or game recaps to find information on which players scored field goals in the 4th quarter. Make a list of all the players who made successful shots and note the details of their performance in the game (e.g. number of shots taken, field goal percentage, etc.). In your article, you can introduce the topic by explaining the importance of the 4th quarter in basketball games and how crucial it is for players to step up and score points. Then, you can present your findings on which players succeeded in doing so in the games you analyzed. For each player, provide some background information on their role on the team and highlight any notable achievements or outstanding moments from their performance in the game. Finally, you can conclude the article with some reflections on the significance of the players' performances and how they contributed to the overall outcome of the game. Make sure to cite your sources and be as specific as possible in your reporting, so readers can trust the accuracy of your information."},{"prompt":"Generate a tweet that has the following sentiment: positive","completion":"\\"Feeling so grateful for all the amazing opportunities that have come my way lately! #blessed #positivity\\""},{"prompt":"Write a dialog with this premise Fred would like Great Britain to stay in the European Union but according to him the EU should evolve.

Get support if you need it.","completion":"Breastfeeding is a rewarding experience for both mother and baby but it comes with some physical and emotional challenges. One of the most common concerns is breast engorgement and leakage. This happens when breast milk production exceeds the amount your baby is drinking. It is important to anticipate this and find ways to relieve the discomfort, such as applying warm compresses, expressing milk manually or using a breast pump. Another aspect to consider is weaning. As you gradually decrease the amount of breastfeeding, your body will undergo hormonal changes that can affect your mood. You may feel irritable, sad, or anxious. It is important to recognize these changes and seek support if needed. Talking to other mothers who have gone through the same experience, seeking advice from healthcare professionals or joining a support group can help you navigate this transition more smoothly. It is also important to realize that breastfeeding can have an impact on your weight. While breastfeeding, you will need to consume more calories to provide enough nutrients for your baby. However, once you stop nursing, you may need to reduce your calorie intake to avoid gaining extra weight. This can be a gradual process, and it is recommended to consult with a nutritionist or your healthcare provider. In summary, breastfeeding is a fulfilling experience that requires preparation and support. Anticipating potential challenges such as breast engorgement and hormonal changes during weaning can help you navigate this journey more easily. Seeking advice, support, and guidance from healthcare professionals, family and friends can make the experience more enjoyable and rewarding for both you and your baby."},{"prompt":"What is a question about this article?

Parker stated that the Department of Public Safety (DPS) wouldn't accept Marquitta's documents because they listed two mothers. As an openly gay woman, Parker is well aware of the difficulties that same-sex couple families face, and she spoke out against what she perceives as discrimination towards her daughter. As the former mayor of Houston, Parker has been a vocal advocate for LGBT rights and marriage equality. She is married to Kathy Hubbard, and together they raised three children: Daniela Parker, Marquitta Parker, and Jovon Tyler. Having fought for her own rights and the rights of her family, Parker is no stranger to standing up against discrimination and advocating for equal treatment. According to Parker, her daughter Marquitta was discriminated against by the DPS. She claims that they refused to accept her documents which listed both of her mothers due to their policy of only recognizing \\"traditional\\" families. Parker believes that this is a clear case of discrimination against same-sex couples and families. However, a spokesperson for the DPS has denied Parker's claims. They state that they do not discriminate against same-sex couples and that their policies are consistent with state law. They also claim that there are specific policies in place for same-sex couples to obtain legal documents. Regardless of the outcome of this particular case, Annise Parker's vocal stance against discrimination serves as a reminder of the continuous fight for equality. Discrimination against individuals and families based on their sexual orientation or gender identity is not acceptable, and it is vital that more individuals speak out against it.

This skill can help you in many situations, from business negotiations to personal relationships. One of the most common signs of dishonesty is a fake smile. A genuine smile involves not only the mouth, but also the eyes and other facial muscles. When someone is faking a smile, their eyes may not \\"crinkle\\" and their head may not tilt. Another clue to deception is when someone's words and body language don't match. For example, if a person shakes their head \\"no\\" while saying \\"yes,\\" or vice versa, this could be a sign of dishonesty. Similarly, if a person frequently looks away when speaking, this could be a sign that they are uncomfortable or concealing something. As you observe a person, pay attention to changes in their behavior. If they suddenly become defensive, evasive or aggressive, this could be a sign of deceit. Also, watch for distancing language, such as using the passive tense or avoiding direct answers. Another clue is the use of idioms or cliches that seem out of place or overused. This could indicate that the person is relying on rehearsed responses rather than speaking from the heart. Finally, be wary of someone who is overly talkative or eager to impress you. This could be a strategy to distract you from their true intentions or to gain your trust. If you suspect that someone is being dishonest, review their story for inconsistencies or contradictions.

Immobilize your shoulder. Exercise your shoulder. Take pain medications as needed. Ice your shoulder. Use surgery as a last resort.","completion":"Shoulder injuries can cause immense discomfort and can hinder one's daily activities. In some cases, a shoulder injury may require medical treatment such as shoulder reduction. This entails the healthcare provider manipulating the shoulder joint to realign the bone. After undergoing shoulder reduction, it is crucial to immobilize the shoulder to stabilize the joint and prevent further injury. This can be achieved using a sling or brace. Once the shoulder is stabilized, it is essential to exercise the affected area gradually. Physical therapy exercises help in improving strength, flexibility, and range of motion of the shoulder. These exercises should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional and in a controlled manner. Pain is a common symptom of a shoulder injury, and it can be managed with pain medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen. These medications should be taken as directed by a healthcare provider and should not be abused. Ice can also help in managing pain and swelling of the shoulder immediately after an injury. Applying ice for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day can be helpful. However, care should be taken not to apply ice directly to the skin, as it may cause frostbite. In rare cases, surgery may be necessary if the injury is severe or if other treatments are ineffective. Surgery may involve repairing damaged tissues or replacing damaged joints. It is vital to explore all other treatment options before considering surgery. In conclusion, shoulder injuries can be debilitating, but with prompt medical attention and appropriate treatment, they can be managed. Undergoing shoulder reduction, immobilizing the shoulder, exercising it gradually, taking pain medications as needed, and using surgery as a last resort can go a long way in managing shoulder injuries."},{"prompt":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to build a fire Buy precut firewood to play it safe, if possible.

Wait up to 10 minutes to allow the ingredients in the hairspray to react with the ink. You should be able to see the ink coming to the surface of the fabric. Gently blot the ink away. Don’t rub, or you risk spreading the ink stain and further damaging the fabric. Be sure all the ink has been removed before washing. Linen can be washed regularly, in your washing machine. Just be sure to separate your “lights” from “darks” to ensure dye doesn’t bleed onto your lightcolored clothing. Hang your garment or lay it flat. Using a clothes dryer will not only shrink your linen but could set the stain if you did not remove it completely.

Start by filling the small bag with your desired ingredients. This can be anything from classic vanilla ice cream ingredients like heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract, or more adventurous flavors like matcha or mint chocolate chip. Once you've added your ingredients to the bag, be sure to reseal it tightly to avoid any leaks. Next, take the larger bag and fill it with a mix of ice and salt. The salt helps to lower the freezing point of the ice, creating a below-freezing environment that's perfect for making ice cream. Once you've filled the bag, reseal it tightly. Now it's time to combine the two bags. Carefully place the small bag filled with ingredients inside the ice-and-salt bag, making sure it's fully submerged in the ice mixture. Again, reseal the larger bag tightly, and start shaking and kneading the bag vigorously. This is the \\"exercise\\" your ice cream needs in order to freeze and solidify! After a few minutes of shaking and kneading, remove the smaller bag from the ice mixture. It should be much thicker and more solid by now, but could still be slightly runny.

Confine your golden retriever puppy when you can’t watch her. Reward your puppy when she pees or poops outside. Stay calm if you catch your puppy in the middle of an accident.","completion":"House training your Golden Retriever puppy can be a challenging process, but it is also an essential part of their early development. It is crucial to start house training as early as possible, preferably when your puppy is around eight weeks old. At this age, puppies have better control of their bladder and bowel movements, making it easier for them to learn. Positive reinforcement and consistency are key to successful house training. Praise and treats after your puppy relieves themselves outside will encourage good behaviour. On the other hand, negative reactions will only confuse and discourage your puppy. A regular feeding schedule will also help with house training. If you feed your puppy at the same time each day, you can predict when they will need to go outside. Taking your puppy out at regular intervals will reduce accidents inside the house. A good rule of thumb is to take them outside before and after naps, playtime, and meals. Keeping a close eye on your puppy is critical during the training process. Supervision is necessary to prevent accidents from happening. If you can't watch your puppy, consider confining them to a small and comfortable space where they can still move around. A crate or a playpen are great options. When your puppy successfully relieves themselves outside, be sure to reward them with plenty of praise and their favourite treat. This positive reinforcement will help your puppy better understand what behaviour is expected of them. It is crucial not to punish your puppy for accidents. Puppies are still learning, and accidents are inevitable. Instead, clean up the mess promptly and stay calm when you catch your puppy mid-accident. In conclusion, house training your Golden Retriever puppy requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Start early, be observant, and follow a regular schedule.

Advertise on a sales website. Utilize social networking sites. Post on a peertopeer website.","completion":"When it comes to advertising, it's important to cast a wide net. To reach as many potential customers as possible, it's recommended to advertise in a minimum of three places. One of those places should be a sales website, such as eBay or Amazon. These websites have millions of users who are already in a buying mindset, making them prime targets for your ads. In addition to sales websites, social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are also great places to advertise. These platforms allow you to target your ads to specific audiences and can help you reach people who might not be actively looking for your product or service. Another effective way to advertise is by posting on peer-to-peer websites like Craigslist or Nextdoor. These websites allow you to connect with people in your local area, making them ideal for advertising products or services that are location-specific. By using these three advertising methods, you can effectively reach a wide range of potential customers and increase your chances of making sales.

Only 11 of the 66 players on offer were snapped up as budgets slashed to 750,000. West Indies allrounder Kieron Pollard went for the full amount as four teams bid for him. Veteran New Zealand pace bowler Shane Bond also sold for maximum 750,000.","completion":"The Indian Premier League cricket series recently concluded its auction for the upcoming season, and it was notable that no Pakistan players were bought. This may be a reflection of the political tensions between India and Pakistan, but it is also indicative of the strict budget limitations placed on teams this year. Only 11 of the 66 players on offer were snapped up, as teams were forced to operate with a maximum budget of 750,000. One player who did fetch the full amount was West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard. Four teams bid for the dynamic performer, and his value was recognized by those who were able to spend big. Veteran New Zealand pace bowler Shane Bond also sold for the maximum amount, demonstrating that quality will always find a way to attract interest. However, it is worrying that no Pakistani players were deemed worth the investment. Pakistan has a rich history of producing high-caliber cricketers, and their absence from the IPL only serves to highlight the ongoing political tensions between the two neighboring countries. It is important that sports remain separate from political disputes, and the decision not to include Pakistani players risks undermining the spirit of the IPL. In conclusion, while the IPL auction showed that quality will always carry value, it was also a stark reminder of broader political tensions. The absence of Pakistan players is a cause for concern and serves as a reminder that sports and politics should remain separate. Let us hope that future IPL auctions see a more diverse range of players, reflecting the true spirit of cricket as a global game."},{"prompt":"Sad day<br>Stacey always wanted to be a mom.

Follow these simple steps to achieve perfectly melted chocolate. Firstly, put your desired amount of chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave them on medium heat for 30 seconds, and then give them a quick stir with a small spoon to help mix the melted parts with the solid chips. Repeat this process at 30-second intervals until the chocolate is completely melted. Make sure to stir it thoroughly every time you take it out of the microwave to prevent burning. Once you have your smooth and melted chocolate, grab a small spoon and use it to drizzle the chocolate over the tops of your cooled macaroons. You can be as creative as you want with the design! Finally, while the macaroons are still sitting on the wire rack, place them in the fridge to allow the chocolate to harden.

Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped the spread of the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the ArabIndonesian, ArabSingaporean, and ArabMalay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis.[citation needed] The Sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by introducing Islamic ideas to the region. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region.

If you're looking for a paper that will give your printed materials a professional and high-quality look, heavy weight paper is a great option to consider. Heavy weight paper is exactly what it sounds like - a paper that is thicker and heavier than standard printer paper. This type of paper is great for things like business cards, brochures, and other marketing materials that you want to look and feel substantial. One advantage of heavy weight paper is that it is less likely to wrinkle, curl, or tear during the printing process. This can be especially important if you're printing a large batch of materials or if you're using a printer that tends to be finicky. Another benefit of heavy weight paper is that it can be ideal for printing graphics and images. The thicker paper stock allows for a better color saturation and sharper detail, resulting in a higher quality printed image. This can be especially important if you're printing something like a product catalog or a brochure that relies heavily on images to convey information. So, how do you choose the right heavy weight paper for your printing needs? One important factor to consider is the weight of the paper. Heavy weight paper typically ranges from around 100 to 300 grams per square meter (gsm), with higher gsm numbers indicating a thicker, heavier paper. For most purposes, a weight of 200 gsm or higher is recommended. Another consideration when choosing heavy weight paper is the finish. A matte finish can be a good choice if you want a more subtle, understated look for your printed materials. A glossy finish, on the other hand, can be great for making colors pop and adding a bit of shine to your marketing materials. Overall, heavy weight paper can be a great investment if you want to elevate the look and feel of your printed materials. Just make sure to choose a paper that is appropriate for your specific printing needs and remember to adjust your printer settings accordingly to get the best results."},{"prompt":"Are the following two questions the same?

And nearly all are directed without any artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite).

Oil it up again. Put your cast iron in the oven. Bake your cast iron.","completion":"Cast iron is a popular cooking material due to its durability and heat retention capabilities. However, it requires regular maintenance to ensure its longevity. One vital step is to reseason the cast iron when necessary. This involves removing any burnt-on food or rust and applying a layer of new seasoning. A simple way to do this is by heating the cast iron and wiping it with vegetable oil. After cooking, it's essential to wash the cast iron with mild soap and a brush to remove any food particles. Avoid using harsh scouring pads or detergents as they can strip the seasoning. Once clean, dry the cast iron thoroughly. To keep the seasoning intact, it's crucial to oil up the cast iron after washing. This involves applying a small amount of vegetable oil or any other high-smoke-point oil and wiping off the excess with a paper towel. Finally, baking the cast iron in the oven can help to reinforce the seasoning. Preheat the oven to 350°F and place the cast iron upside down on the middle rack. Bake for one hour, then let it cool in the oven before removing. By following these simple steps, you can maintain your cast iron and enjoy a reliable cooking surface for years to come."},{"prompt":"Attributes: name = The Punter, eatType = coffee shop, food = Japanese, priceRange = more than £30, customer rating = 5 out of 5, near = Café Sicilia.

A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious.

This is the first time such cooperative behavior has been observed in the wild. The two groups, known as \\"pods,\\" each have their own unique hunting techniques. One pod utilizes a form of bubble-netting, in which they release bubbles to corral prey into a concentrated area. The other pod uses a more traditional method of hunting, relying on individual efforts to isolate and capture their targets.

The bubble-netting pod would release bubbles to corral the prey, while the other whales would swim in to capture their targets.

One important step is to identify the preemptive urge that triggers the tic. This may involve paying close attention to the body's sensations or signals just before the tic occurs. Once you understand these urges, you can work on suppressing the tic itself by engaging in a different behavior. This can be anything from squeezing a stress ball to taking deep breaths or using a relaxation technique. It's also important to work with a behavioral therapist who specializes in tic disorders. They can help you identify triggers, develop coping strategies, and provide support and guidance throughout the process. With their expertise, you can create a targeted treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and goals. Finally, it's important to be patient throughout the process. Learning to suppress tics takes time and consistent practice. Don't get discouraged if progress is slow or if setbacks occur. Celebrate small victories along the way and focus on the overall progress you make. In conclusion, managing tic disorders requires a combination of strategies, including identifying preemptive urges, developing alternative behaviors, working with a therapist, and being patient with the process.

The story is incomprehensible, the music is forgettable, and the CGI is uncanny and unsettling. The film follows a group of \\"jellicle\\" cats as they compete for a chance to ascend to the \\"heaviside layer\\", but this flimsy plot is merely a vehicle for a series of unrelated musical numbers that make no sense and are impossible to follow. The characters are all played by recognizable actors who are unrecognizable under layers of digital fur, and their singing and dancing is both over-the-top and underwhelming at the same time. While some may argue that the film is a campy, so-bad-it's-good experience, the reality is that it is a deeply unpleasant and uncomfortable watch. The decision to use CGI to create the cats instead of practical effects is a major misstep, resulting in characters that look like grotesque monstrosities instead of lovable felines. The film is also too long, suffering from pacing issues and an inability to stay focused on any one plot point. Ultimately, Cats is a movie that should never have been made.

Stand one metre away from the player with the ball if you are a defender. Follow the threesecond ball possession rule. Remain in your designated position zone. Keep the ball in bounds.","completion":"Basketball is a game of strategy, teamwork and skill. To ensure fair play, there are several rules that must be followed by every player on the court. Here are some important rules that every basketball player should know: Firstly, when you have the ball, you must not move at all with it. This is called traveling, and it can result in a turnover, giving the ball to the other team. It’s important to pass the ball quickly to an open teammate, or shoot it into the basket if you’re in a good position. Secondly, each team must keep seven players on the court at all times. If a team has fewer than seven players, they will forfeit the game. This rule ensures that teams have an equal number of players, and that the game can continue without any unfair advantage. Thirdly, if you are a defender, you must stand one metre away from the player with the ball. This is known as the defending distance rule. If you get too close to the player with the ball, you risk getting a foul, which gives the other team free throws. Fourthly, the three-second ball possession rule states that a player cannot hold the ball for more than three seconds while closely guarded by an opponent. If a player fails to pass or shoot the ball before the three seconds are up, they will lose possession of the ball. Fifthly, each player must remain in their designated position zone. There are five positions in basketball: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. Each player must play within their assigned zone, and cannot simply wander around the court wherever they please. Finally, players must keep the ball in bounds at all times. This means that the ball must stay within the sideline and baseline boundaries of the court. If a player touches the ball when it’s out of bounds, or steps out of bounds while holding the ball, the other team will gain possession of the ball.

The report, compiled by United Nations investigator Philip Alston, accuses security forces in Kenya of killing hundreds of men in a crackdown that took place in 2008. Alston’s investigation found that many of these killings were carried out by police death squads who received orders from senior officials within the government. The report has prompted widespread outrage and calls for action from human rights groups and the public alike. Many are now calling for those responsible for the deaths of innocent individuals to be held accountable for their actions.

A dewy finish can give your skin a radiant glow, and using a setting spray can help your makeup last longer. However, there are a few important tips to keep in mind to make the most of your makeup application. First, be sure to finish with a dewy setting spray. This will help set your makeup in place and give your skin a glowing finish. When choosing a setting spray, be sure to choose one that is compatible with your skin type. If you have oily skin, look for a matte finish setting spray. If you have dry skin, opt for a dewy finish setting spray. Next, avoid touching your face. Touching your face can transfer oil and bacteria from your hands to your skin, which can lead to breakouts. If you do need to touch your face, be sure to wash your hands first. If you find that your makeup is starting to fade throughout the day, reapply your makeup as needed. Focus on areas that may have faded, such as your cheeks or eyelids. However, try not to overdo it. Applying too much makeup can make it look cakey and heavy. In conclusion, finishing with a dewy setting spray, avoiding touching your face, reapplying your makeup as needed, and trying not to overdo it are all important tips for making the most of your makeup application.

However, the confirmation followed chaotic scenes in the Parliament on Sunday. The Tripoli government has been struggling to impose order in a country awash with weapons, and many Libyans are angry at the slow progress towards democratic stability and the worsening security situation. Mitig's confirmation comes at a time when Libya is facing numerous challenges, including political instability, economic difficulties, and growing security concerns. The country has been in a state of chaos since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with various factions and groups vying for power and control. The confirmation process itself was marked by chaos and violence, with rival factions exchanging blows and throwing chairs. It is clear that there is still a significant amount of tension and division within the government, and it remains to be seen whether Mitig will be able to bring about any real change. One of the major challenges facing Mitig and his government is the issue of security. Libya is awash with weapons, and various armed groups and militias still maintain a significant amount of power and influence. These groups pose a threat not only to stability within Libya but also to neighboring countries in the region. The slow pace of democratic progress is also a cause for concern.

Many Libyans are frustrated with the lack of progress and are calling for greater transparency and accountability.

Swap out your pistons for a higher compression ratio. Install more aggressive camshafts. Use headers to improve exhaust flow. Use a boost controller in turbocharged vehicles.","completion":"Upgrading your engine's performance is an exciting process, but it can be overwhelming when you don't know where to start. Here are some modifications you can make to your engine to increase power and torque. First, consider installing a new throttle body. A larger throttle body can increase the flow of air into the engine, improving performance. This is especially effective when paired with other modifications, such as a cold air intake or upgraded exhaust system. Swapping out your pistons for ones with a higher compression ratio can also increase power. Higher compression ratios result in a stronger combustion process, which translates to more power. However, this modification requires precision and expertise, and should only be performed by a professional. Installing more aggressive camshafts is another way to improve performance. Camshafts control the opening and closing of the engine's valves, which affects the timing and duration of the combustion process. Upgrading to more aggressive camshafts can increase power and torque throughout the entire RPM range. To further improve exhaust flow, consider installing headers. Headers are designed to optimize exhaust flow out of the engine and into the exhaust system. This reduction in backpressure can improve performance and increase efficiency. For turbocharged vehicles, using a boost controller is an effective way to increase horsepower. A boost controller allows for more precise control over the amount of boost pressure the turbocharger produces. This can result in significant increases in power, especially when paired with other modifications. Upgrading your engine's performance is a great way to bring new life to your vehicle. However, it's important to make modifications responsibly and seek the guidance of a professional if necessary. By carefully selecting the right modifications for your vehicle, you can enjoy a noticeable increase in performance and overall driving experience."},{"prompt":"Text: The day is marked in London by the ceremony of Trooping the Colour, which is also known as the Queen's Birthday Parade.

It is also worth noting that the first team to score does not necessarily guarantee a win. Many games have seen the initial point scorers lose due to a shift in momentum or strategic adjustments made by their opponents. In conclusion, the answer to the question of which team received the first points on the board depends on the specific game or event being referred to. However, scoring the first points does not guarantee a win, and the game's outcome can fluctuate based on various factors."},{"prompt":"Premise: This is also the site of Waverley Station, and the sound of arriving trains can be heard as background noise throughout the day.

Called the bloomery process, it produced very soft but ductile wrought iron. By 800 BC, ironmaking technology had spread to Europe, arriving in Japan around 700 AD. Pig iron, a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and carbon, was being produced in China as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a lower melting point than iron, and was used for making castiron. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of crucible steel around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of pattern welding, around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomerysteel and castiron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove slag and impurities.
