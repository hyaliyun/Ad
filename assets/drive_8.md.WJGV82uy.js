He also performed for them and helped to uplift their spirits during their service. Williams also supported St. Jude Children's Hospital, a leading research and treatment center for children with cancer and other life-threatening diseases. He volunteered his time to visit the children and provide them with joy and laughter. He was known for his performances during the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital annual fundraiser, helping to raise millions of dollars in donations. Another charitable cause close to Williams' heart was The Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. Williams served on the board of this organization, which is dedicated to advancing treatments and therapies for people living with paralysis. They achieve this through funding research, improving quality of life, and providing resources and support for those affected by paralysis. Williams' contribution to these charitable causes did not go unnoticed. In 2007, he was awarded the \\"Bob Hope Award for Excellence in Entertainment\\" by the Congressional Medal of Honor Society for his work with the USO. In the same year, he also received the \\"Heart of the City Award\\" from The Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco for his philanthropic work.

However, Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. In this way, Principia Mathematica's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"The Syrian conflict has displaced millions of citizens since its outbreak in 2011, with over 600,000 refugees fleeing abroad to escape violence between rebels and government forces. However, the conditions faced by these refugees outside the country are perhaps even more disconcerting. The majority of the refugees are suffering intense hardships in under-resourced refugee camps hit by freezing wet weather. As a result, thousands of refugees face an uncertain future as they deal with these challenging conditions. Sadly, a recent report highlights that the number one reason that refugees have given for leaving the country is the threat of sexual violence. This shocking observation is a harrowing reminder of the precarious conditions that many people faced while living in this war-torn country. In light of these challenges, aid organizations have been working hard to provide assistance to the displaced communities, both inside and outside of Syria; nevertheless, there is an urgent need to increase their resources and capabilities to meet the needs of the most vulnerable. Without adequate support, these people could face a bleak future, potentially stranded in overcrowded and under-resourced refugee camps. Therefore, it is vital that governments and humanitarian organizations work together to provide much-needed assistance to refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict. It is a collective responsibility to ensure that these individuals receive the support they need to start rebuilding their lives and regain some measure of hope for the future. In summary, the refugee crisis has disproportionately affected the people of Syria, with thousands still struggling for survival in unsanitary living conditions. As a community of global citizens, we must continue to support these individuals and provide them with the resources necessary to facilitate their resettlement and ensure their protection against the various forms of violence they have encountered in Syria."},{"prompt":"Read this: The Times faced financial extinction in 1890 under Arthur Fraser Walter, but it was rescued by an energetic editor, Charles Frederic Moberly Bell.

Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Cyprus are all facing dire economic circumstances, and many experts believe that the crisis is a \\"hard lesson\\" for the entire region. In response to these challenges, the European Union has proposed a banking union that will be regulated by the European Central Bank. This union is set to become active in 2014, and could play a major role in preventing future financial crises from affecting the eurozone. The banking union would allow the ECB to oversee the regulation and supervision of all banks in the region, ensuring greater stability and transparency. It would be comprised of two key components: a single supervisory mechanism and a common resolution framework. The single supervisory mechanism would create a unified system for overseeing all eurozone banks, which would be overseen by the ECB. This would help to prevent the situation in which a single failed bank could threaten the entire financial system. The common resolution framework, on the other hand, would create a mechanism for dealing with failing banks in an orderly manner. It would set out clear rules and procedures for resolving bank failures, minimizing the impact on the wider economy. Critics of the banking union argue that it may take power away from individual countries and could make it more difficult for smaller banks to compete with larger ones. However, those in favor of the union argue that it is necessary to prevent future crises from causing widespread economic damage. As the eurozone continues to grapple with ongoing economic challenges, many are looking to the banking union as a potential solution. While it remains to be seen how effective this new system will be, it represents an important step towards greater financial stability and cooperation within the region."},{"prompt":"Do these mean the same?

Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19thcentury development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses. Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. By the mid1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by Henry Head and experiments by Max von Frey, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact.

Across the world, people are devising innovative ways to fight climate change, from reducing their carbon footprint to finding alternative sources of energy. Two such individuals who are making significant contributions in this regard are Joseph Adelegan and Chewang Norphel. Joseph Adelegan, a young Nigerian engineer, has come up with an innovative way to convert cow waste and cassava plants into fuel. He founded Lafnet Renewable Energy in 2015 and has since been working to tackle two major environmental problems: waste management and clean energy. The technology developed by Adelegan converts cow waste and cassava plants into biogas, which can be used as an alternative source of energy. The process is cost-effective and environmentally friendly and has the potential to revolutionize the energy industry. Chewang Norphel, on the other hand, has been dubbed the \\"Ice Man\\" for his ingenious solution to the water scarcity problem faced by the Ladakh region of India. Norphel devised a method to create artificial glaciers by diverting the water of melting snow into small valleys where it freezes and forms ice. This ice is then used throughout the year for irrigation and drinking purposes. Norphel's technique not only provides a sustainable solution to the water crisis but also reduces the threat of floods caused by sudden melting of snow. Both Adelegan and Norphel are making significant contributions towards fighting climate change and creating a sustainable future. Their success shows that sometimes simple, yet innovative solutions can have a huge impact in addressing complex environmental problems.

Moneypenny was originally called Miss Pettavel or Petty.","completion":"A recently revealed 1952 draft of Ian Fleming's Casino Royale has led to some fascinating insights into the creation of James Bond. Fleming's niece has uncovered the draft, which was previously unpublished, and it reveals a number of interesting details about the early Bond universe. One particularly intriguing detail is the potential source of the name \\"Casino Royale.\\" Many fans had assumed that the name was purely a product of Fleming's imagination, but the draft suggests that he may have been inspired by a 19th-century philosopher named Charles Fourier. Fourier wrote a book called \\"The Social Destiny of Man,\\" which contains a passage that includes the phrase \\"casino of the passions.\\" It's possible that this phrase stuck in Fleming's mind and eventually led to the creation of \\"Casino Royale.\\" Another interesting tidbit from the draft is the original name for Bond's secretary, Moneypenny. In the draft, she is referred to as Miss Pettavel or Petty. It's unclear why Fleming would have changed her name to Moneypenny, but it's certainly a more memorable moniker! Overall, the newly revealed draft offers a fascinating glimpse into the early days of James Bond. It's always exciting to learn more about the creation of beloved characters and stories, and this draft provides some excellent insights into the origins of one of the most iconic fictional universes of all time."},{"prompt":"Data: King's Stand Stakes WINNER/2ND 2nd Dandy Man; King's Stand Stakes VENUE Ascot (UK); RACE King's Stand Stakes; 2nd Dandy Man RESULT Won; 200607 Season as a Five Year Old What would a sentence about this data be like?","completion":"In the 2006-07 season as a five-year-old, the King's Stand Stakes race held at Ascot in the UK was won with Dandy Man coming in second."},{"prompt":"Write a positive movie review.","completion":"This movie is an absolute delight!

This can be any surface that you would like to use as a base, such as a pendant or earring backing. Make sure that the glue is strong enough to hold the shell securely in place. Next, add the spikes along the sides of the shell. These spikes can be found at any craft store, and they will help to create an edgy look to the piece. Use jewelry wire to attach the spikes, wrapping the wire around both the spike and the base. Once the spikes are in place, create more layers by adding different types of beads around the shell. These can be any type of bead that you desire, such as pearls or crystals. Arrange the beads in a visually pleasing way, and attach them to the base with jewelry wire. If there are any gaps left between the shell, spikes, and beads, you can fill them in with fillers. These fillers can be any small objects that you think would complement the piece. For example, you could use small seashells or tiny charms. Finally, finish off with the details. Add any finishing touches that you think the piece needs, such as more beads or a special clasp.

Art can be destroyed by natural disasters, war and conflict, vandalism, neglect, and even well-intentioned preservation efforts gone wrong. One extreme example of the destruction of art can be seen in the Mongol Empire's conquest of Baghdad in 1258. The Mongols, seeking to punish the wealthy and cultured city for rebelling against their rule, massacred tens of thousands of residents and destroyed almost every building and cultural artifact they could find. This included the burning of the famous House of Wisdom, a repository of ancient knowledge and scholarship that held countless texts from all over the Islamic world and beyond. Another example of widespread destruction of art can be seen in World War II. The bombing and shelling of cities across Europe and Asia led to significant losses of cultural heritage, with countless paintings, sculptures, and historic buildings destroyed in the chaos. One striking example is the Kaiser Wilhelm Museum in Krefeld, Germany, which was completely destroyed by Allied bombing in 1943, taking with it numerous works by artists including Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne. In addition to these large-scale events, there are countless smaller instances of art being lost or destroyed over time. Ancient sculptures and temples in Greece and Rome have weathered centuries of exposure to the elements, while countless priceless works of art have been lost to theft, fire, or neglect. Overall, the question of how many different countries' works of art have been ruined is a complex one, as the answer is constantly changing as new instances of destruction and loss occur. However, it is clear that the preservation of cultural heritage is an ongoing and vital concern, as our collective artistic heritage is a precious resource that must be protected for future generations."},{"prompt":"Read this and answer the question According to Forbes' Most Influential Celebrities 2014 list, Spielberg was listed as the most influential celebrity in America.

This body language conveys that you are approachable and willing to listen. Avoid crossing your arms or legs as this may indicate a closed-minded attitude. Instead, keep your arms uncrossed, and lean slightly forward to show that you are attentive. Before approaching any conversation, it is important to approach it with an open mind. Be willing to hear different perspectives and acknowledge that people have different experiences that shape their views. By approaching the conversation openly, you can facilitate a constructive dialogue with the other person. Lastly, validation is a crucial component of effective communication. This means that you acknowledge and accept the other person's experiences, views, and feelings. It does not require you to agree with them; instead, it means that you respect their individuality and the validity of their experiences.

Spelt is an ancient grain that is high in protein and easier to digest than wheat. It also contains more fiber, vitamins, and minerals than traditional wheat flour. When substituting white spelt flour for all-purpose flour, it's important to keep in mind that spelt flour absorbs liquid differently. To avoid a too moist or too dry result, you should reduce the liquids in your recipe by ¼. For example, if you're making a cake that requires 1 cup of water, you should use only ¾ cup when using spelt flour. When mixing spelt dough, the technique should also be different. Spelt flour is delicate and has a lower gluten content than wheat flour. To avoid overworking the dough and creating a tough product, mix the dough or batter lightly. You can also let it rest for a few minutes before shaping or baking to give the flour time to absorb moisture. In conclusion, using white spelt flour in your baking can be a healthy and delicious option.

Early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance — as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the flashing process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency. A metallized or graphitized filament was first heated in a hightemperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. This also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, and helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage.

The issue was caused by a certain type of fungus that was found on the packaging materials used for the medication. This issue raised concerns among patients who had purchased Lipitor and were worried about potential health risks.

Even though Pfizer assured the public that the health risk was minimal, any abnormal odor coming from medication should be taken seriously.

Uranium235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope. Uranium238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium235 and to a lesser degree uranium233 have a much higher fission crosssection for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extrachromosomal DNA. Antibacterialproducing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterialresistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Crossresistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.

The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis.

Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally.

These can serve as a preview of what's to come and can help build excitement for the main event. Sample dishes also provide the opportunity to experiment and refine your recipes before serving them to a big crowd. When setting up sample dishes, it is important to consider the presentation as well as the taste. Use attractive plates or serving dishes that complement the colors and textures of the food. Garnishes such as fresh herbs or edible flowers can add a pop of color and elevate the visual appeal of the dishes. It's also crucial to choose a variety of sample dishes that showcase a range of flavors and ingredients. For example, you could set up a flatbread with a roasted garlic and goat cheese spread alongside a spicy shrimp and avocado salad. A vegetarian option such as a quinoa and roasted vegetable salad can also be offered to cater to different dietary needs. When it comes to portion sizes, remember that these are sample dishes and not full courses, so keep them small enough to allow guests to try multiple options without filling up too quickly. Aim for two to three bites per serving. Finally, make sure to label each sample dish clearly so that guests know what they are trying. This can also be helpful for gathering feedback on the dishes and making adjustments as needed. In conclusion, setting up several sample dishes is a great way to showcase your culinary skills, experiment with recipes, and build excitement for the main event.

His family believes he was murdered; authorities say the death was accidental. The new video raises more questions than it answers. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Kendrick Johnson's death inside a rolled-up gym mat has been a controversial case since it occurred in 2013. Johnson's family believes that he was murdered, but authorities have maintained that his death was accidental. Recently, a new video has been released that raises even more questions about the circumstances surrounding Johnson's death. The video shows Johnson entering the gym where the incident occurred on the day of his death. He is then followed by several other students who can be seen leaving the gym shortly after. However, Johnson never emerges from the gym alive. Johnson's body was found hours later by fellow students who had entered the gymnasium for a wrestling match. It was discovered inside a rolled-up gym mat, leading to speculation that he had been murdered and then placed inside the mat. Despite the family's belief that Johnson was murdered, two separate investigations, conducted by the Department of Justice and the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office, ultimately concluded that his death was accidental. Specifically, the investigation determined that Johnson had crawled into the gym mat to retrieve a shoe and then became trapped, ultimately leading to his death by asphyxiation. However, the new video raises questions about the official narrative of events that led to Johnson's death. For one, the footage does not show Johnson entering the gym mat voluntarily, effectively refuting the original explanation. Additionally, the video shows Johnson entering the gym when he was supposed to be in class, suggesting that he may have been there for illegal activities or witnessed something he shouldn't have. The release of this new video is likely to reignite suspicions and questions about the circumstances surrounding Kendrick Johnson's death. It remains to be seen if further information will be uncovered that provides additional insights into what happened inside that gymnasium on that fateful day in 2013."},{"prompt":"Concepts: appeal, match, wicket Write a sentence that includes all these words.","completion":"The bowler appealed for a wicket and upon review, the umpire determined that the delivery was a match to the batsman's edge, resulting in no dismissal."},{"prompt":"Q: when did the strong museum of play open?","completion":"The Strong Museum of Play opened in 1982."},{"prompt":"Scandinavian Glass 19302000 Smoke Ice Add punctuatio","completion":"Scandinavian Glass 1930-2000, Smoke, Ice."},{"prompt":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","completion":"A task that would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning is solving a physics or engineering problem that involves understanding the physical principles, forces, and movements involved in a real-world situation or system."},{"prompt":"What is the most logical next event?

Football fans never cease to be amazed by a booming kick that splits the uprights, especially when such a field goal is longer than most others. But, how much longer was Lion's longest field goal over Dolphin's longest one? Let's find out. The Detroit Lions and the Miami Dolphins are two NFL football teams with a rich history in football. Over the years, many talented kickers have graced their respective rosters, leaving their mark on the game with crucial field goals in crucial moments. So, let's take a look at the longest field goals made by each team. The longest field goal in Detroit Lions' history was made by Jason Hanson in 2008, during a game against the Minnesota Vikings. Hanson booted the ball 58 yards to give the Lions a lead in the second quarter. In comparison, the Miami Dolphins' longest field goal was achieved by Olindo Mare in 1999, during a game against the New York Jets. Mare nailed a 54-yard field goal in the first quarter to put the Dolphins up by three. Therefore, Lion's longest field goal was 4 yards longer than Dolphin's longest one. While that might not seem like a lot, it could be the difference between winning and losing a game. In the high-pressure world of football, every yard counts, and having a kicker with a strong leg can make a huge difference. In conclusion, the Detroit Lions hold the record for the longest field goal in their history, with a 58-yarder from Jason Hanson. The Miami Dolphins' longest field goal was a 54-yarder from Olindo Mare in 1999. Lion's longest field goal was, therefore, 4 yards longer than Dolphin's longest one.

Evans, who is due to start training with Sheffield United this week, proposed to Massey after serving two and a half years in jail for rape. The striker has been subject to intense criticism since his release, with many accusing him of not showing remorse for his actions. Despite this, Massey has remained loyal to her partner and has publicly defended him. She recently stated that she believes Evans is innocent and that \\"he wouldn't be capable of committing a crime like that.\\" Many have found Massey's unwavering support for Evans unsettling, especially considering the severity of the crime he has been accused of. However, it's important to remember that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. While Evans may have been convicted in a court of law, there are still many who believe he did not receive a fair trial.

Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis.

However, it’s essential to keep in mind that resolving family problems in a healthy manner is vital. Here are some tips to help address a family problem when it arises. Firstly, it’s always helpful to try to reach a compromise. In many cases, finding a middle ground is the best option for families. It's particularly important when dealing with sensitive matters such as parenting decisions or family finances. Approaching the issue with a willingness to discuss alternative options can help avoid potential arguments. Talking to family members one-on-one is another effective way to address family issues. It's a useful solution when addressing personal issues that may be difficult to discuss as a group. It's essential not to take sides, instead of trying to understand each person's point of view. If the issue involves the entire family, it's a good idea to call a family council. This can be an opportunity for each person to share their thoughts and feelings without judgment. It’s important to establish ground rules for communication during the family council to ensure everyone is heard and respected. Sometimes, written communication can be more effective, especially if the issue is too emotional to discuss face-to-face. Writing a letter to the family member can provide an opportunity to express thoughts and feelings in a well-thought-out manner. It also helps to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunication. Finally, when addressing a family problem with a child, it’s important to listen actively. Children feel valued when they are listened to and validated. This helps them understand that their opinions and feelings are valuable and essential to consider. In conclusion, addressing family problems can be challenging, but it’s essential to approach them with patience and a willingness to work towards solutions. Each family member's point of view should be respected, and communication should be done in a calm, respectful, and honest manner.

However, it is important to remain calm and composed and know what steps to take to ensure your safety. The Triangle of Life is a term coined by Doug Copp, a safety expert, to describe a controversial earthquake survival technique. The Triangle of Life method suggests that in the event of an earthquake, one should not seek shelter under a sturdy table or door frame, but instead should look for a nearby structure or piece of furniture to huddle in the fetal position next to. This technique is supposed to create a triangular void that will protect a person from falling debris. However, this method has been met with criticism from experts who argue that it is not scientifically supported. According to the American Red Cross, following the \\"Drop, Cover, and Hold On\\" method is the best way to increase your chances of survival during an earthquake. This method instructs individuals to drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy table or desk, and hold onto it until the shaking stops. Furthermore, the Triangle of Life method is also considered controversial because it goes against the principles of seismic engineering. Earthquake-resistant building codes and regulations are designed to ensure buildings and structures are resilient and able to protect occupants against earthquake hazards. Seeking shelter in a specific triangular void could put individuals at risk of being exposed to other hazards, such as gas leaks, fires, or building collapses. In summary, while the Triangle of Life method may seem like a valid option during an earthquake, it is not a recommended survival technique. Instead, individuals should follow recommended safety measures such as Drop, Cover, and Hold On. It is important to have a plan of action during an earthquake and to know how to keep yourself and your loved ones safe."},{"prompt":"Empiricism: British empiricism, though it was not a term used at the time, derives from the 17th century period of early modern philosophy and modern science.

In a statement, UK Chancellor Philip Hammond said that the government would be clamping down on MoD spending, with a particular focus on ensuring that taxpayers' money was being spent appropriately. The comments come after a review of the MoD's spending found that some companies had been overcharging for their services or billing the department for activities that were not related to their contracts. These \\"inappropriate\\" activities are said to include lavish overseas trips, expensive gifts, and even payments to company directors. Hammond and former Chancellor George Osborne have declared that they will be working together to ensure that the MoD receives better value for money. The duo is expected to adopt a more rigorous approach to procurement and will be conducting a thorough review of all of the department's contracts. In a joint statement, the two announced that they would be taking strong action to address the issue of wasteful spending. They said that they would be tightening the rules on the use of taxpayers' money and would be cracking down on any instances of fraud, corruption, or waste. The announcement has been welcomed by many, including some defence experts who have long been critical of the MoD's procurement practices. They have argued that the department has often paid over the odds for substandard equipment and services, and that a more rigorous approach is needed to ensure that the UK's military is properly equipped.

Sir James has long been an advocate for greater access to court proceedings, arguing that it is essential for public trust and confidence in the justice system. Currently, journalists and members of the public are only allowed to attend court proceedings in exceptional circumstances, such as cases involving national security or issues of public interest. However, Sir James has argued that this system is restrictive and outdated, and that it can often lead to confusion and mistrust among members of the public. Under the new rules proposed by Sir James, the media would have greater access to court proceedings, and would be able to report on cases more freely. This would enable the public to be better informed about the workings of the justice system, and would increase transparency and accountability across the board. The move has been welcomed by many legal experts and commentators, who see it as an important step forward for the justice system. However, there are concerns that the new rules could be open to abuse by the media, who may seek to sensationalize court proceedings or reveal sensitive information. Despite these concerns, the announcement by Sir James is a clear indication of the need for greater transparency and accountability within the justice system. As such, it is likely to be welcomed by members of the public who are keen to see greater openness and honesty in the legal process."},{"prompt":"Write a sentence based on no word on mongolian activist s release in china","completion":"There is currently no update on the release of the Mongolian activist in China."},{"prompt":"Are these paraphrases?

Among them were Arras and Compiegne. To determine the difference between the number of soldiers from Arras and Compiegne, it is important to look at the population of each town. In 1914, Arras had a population of approximately 24,000, while Compiegne had a population of around 9,000. Although there is no exact count of how many soldiers from each town joined the fight, it is safe to assume that Arras sent more soldiers. With triple the population of Compiegne, it is likely that there were at least three times as many soldiers from Arras. It is also important to note that the number of soldiers from each town may have been affected by other factors such as recruitment efforts, economic conditions, and social and cultural attitudes towards the war. In any case, it is clear that both Arras and Compiegne played a significant role in the war effort, and it is a testament to the bravery and sacrifice of the soldiers and civilians from these towns."},{"prompt":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: He received the Steiner Prize from the Berlin Academy for his discovery of the 27 lines and the 36 double six on the general cubic surface","completion":"He received the Steiner Prize from the Berlin Academy for his discovery of the 27 lines and the 36 double six on the general cubic surface."},{"prompt":"Thousands rally to support embattled Tunisia government Generate a new sentence that is, on a scale from 0 to 5, a 5 in textual similarity to the above sentence.","completion":"Massive crowds gather in backing the besieged Tunisian regime."},{"prompt":"Context:I then got drunk and played sonny 's on the square .

Prune off the heads of your tulips using gardening shears. Avoid removing the tulip leaves when you’re pruning. Remove the leaves about 6 weeks after flowering.","completion":"When it comes to gardening, tulips are always a favorite choice due to their beautiful blooms. However, like all plants, they require maintenance to keep them healthy and looking their best. Pruning is an essential part of tulip care, but it's important to do it at the right time to avoid damaging the plant. The best time to prune your tulips is after they have finished blooming and the flowers begin to fade. This is because the tulips need time to absorb nutrients from their leaves and store them for the next growing season. So, you should wait patiently until the blooms start to fade. Once you notice that the tulips' blooms are beginning to wilt, use gardening shears or scissors to prune off the heads of the tulips, starting with the topmost bloom. Cut the stem at least two to three inches below the flower, so that you'll avoid cutting the stems too short, which would impair their metabolism. When pruning your tulips, be careful not to damage the leaves, for they play an important role in photosynthesis. They provide the plant with the energy needed to grow and develop. This is why it's essential to avoid removing the leaves during the pruning process. After about six weeks, the tulip leaves will turn yellow and begin to die back naturally. This is the time to remove them, which will help prevent the spread of disease and pests. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut the leaves down to the base of the plant, and discard them in the trash to prevent any pests or diseases from harming your other plants. In conclusion, pruning your tulips is a necessary task to help maintain the health and beauty of your garden. Just ensure you do it at the right time, which is when the blooms begin to fade. Always use gardening shears or scissors to prune the heads, avoiding damage to the leaf blades. You can remove the leaves only after they turn yellow and start to fade, to help maintain a healthy plant. With these simple tips, you'll keep your tulips looking their best, year after year."},{"prompt":"Fact: adding salt to a liquid decreases the melting point of that liquid Question: If the temperature is 34 degrees Fahrenheit, what could be put on top of the icy sidewalk to turn the ice to liquid?
