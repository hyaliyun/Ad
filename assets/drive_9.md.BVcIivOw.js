However, Indonesia invaded the country later that year and annexed it in 1976. The resistance movement began soon after, with Timorese civilians and armed groups fighting against Indonesian forces to regain their independence. The rebellion against the Indonesian occupation lasted for 24 years, until the United Nations organized a referendum in 1999, which resulted in the country's independence. During these years, the Timorese resistance struggled with limited resources and support from the international community. The struggle involved armed resistance by charismatic guerrilla leaders, such as Xanana Gusmão, who became a symbol of the Timorese resistance. The resistance was met with brutal repression from Indonesian forces, resulting in the loss of an estimated 100,000 lives, mostly civilians. Many Timorese were killed, tortured, raped, or imprisoned as a result of their involvement in the resistance. However, international solidarity movements intensified towards the end of the 1990s, leading to increased pressure on the Indonesian government to allow a referendum on independence. In conclusion, the Timorese resistance lasted for 24 years, from 1975 to 1999, before East Timor finally achieved independence.

Meanwhile, the median income for a household - which includes both families and non-family households - was 62,843. This means that the median income for a family was 5,860 higher than the median income for a household. It is important to note that these figures represent median incomes, which are not the same as average incomes. Median income measures the point at which half of the incomes in a given group are higher and half are lower. This makes it a useful way to gauge the typical income earned by a family or household, as it is not skewed by extremely high or low earners. The income gap between families and households may reflect some of the underlying economic trends in the United States. For example, while both families and households have seen some income growth in recent years, families have generally fared better. In 2019, the median income for families was 7.2% higher than it had been in 2015, adjusting for inflation. For households, the figure was 6.9%. There are many factors that can influence the median income for families and households, such as the number of earners in a household, the level of education achieved by those earners, the region in which they live, and the industry in which they work. Some studies suggest that income inequality has been widening in the United States over the past several decades, with high earners benefiting more from economic growth than those at the middle and bottom of the income distribution. In summary, the median income for a family in the United States was 68,703 in 2019, while the median income for a household was 62,843. This means that the median income for a family was 5,860 higher than the median income for a household. While this gap may reflect some underlying economic trends, it is important to remember that individual circumstances can have a significant impact on income levels."},{"prompt":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

They are then reflected back. You can predict the angle of the reflected light. Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny.

Some researchers have tried to clarify the idea of race by equating it to the biological idea of the clade. Often mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome sequences are used to study ancient human migration paths. These singlelocus sources of DNA do not recombine and are inherited from a single parent. Individuals from the various continental groups tend to be more similar to one another than to people from other continents, and tracing either mitochondrial DNA or nonrecombinant Ychromosome DNA explains how people in one place may be largely derived from people in some remote location.

After years of turning a blind eye to the trade that rakes in billions of dollars a year—almost half the country's GDP—hundreds of police officers backed by armored vehicles have been deployed to the potfarming village of Lazarat and are battling villagers armed with RPGs, mortars, and machine guns, the AP reports. The government says it is now in control of around half the village and has burned 11 tons of marijuana, a small fraction of the 900 tons the village is believed to produce every year. The crackdown, which has only injured one police officer and three villagers despite the heavy gunfire, is part of the new Socialist government's attempt to stamp out the trade and boost its bid to join the European Union, the BBC reports. At Bloomberg, Leonid Bershidsky says he has a better idea. Brussels should consider legalizing marijuana throughout the EU, he writes. Then Albania, with its welldeveloped cannabis industry, could be welcomed to the union as a country with a legitimate, honorable specialization.

By removing the moisture from the food, you can prevent the growth of bacteria and extend the shelf life of your favorite snacks. Plus, dehydrating can enhance the flavor of your food by concentrating its natural sweetness. One of the simplest ways to dehydrate food is by using a dehydrator. You can find dehydrators at most kitchen supply stores, and they come in a variety of sizes and shapes to fit your needs. Just slice your food into thin, even pieces and arrange them on the dehydrator trays. Turn on the machine and let the warm air do the rest. Depending on the type of food and your desired level of dryness, the dehydration process can take anywhere from a few hours to a full day. In addition to dehydrating, there are other methods of food preservation that can add depth and complexity to your cooking. One popular technique is smoking meats, which imparts a rich, smoky flavor to your favorite cuts. If you don't have a dedicated smoker, you can create your own smoker using a stovetop or grill with a smoking packet. Just choose a hardwood like hickory or mesquite, which burn slowly and produce the most flavorful smoke. Another method is curing meats, which involves coating the meat in a mixture of salt, sugar, and spices to preserve it. This method has been used for centuries to keep meats fresh through long winters or journeys. While it may take a bit of practice to achieve the perfect balance of salt and sweetness, it's worth it for the unique flavors and textures that curing can bring out in your meat. Overall, there are plenty of ways to experiment with food preservation and enhance the flavors and textures of your favorite dishes.

Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov (Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов), Nikolai Gogol (Никола́й Го́голь), Aleksander Griboyedov (Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.

When comparing the groups of 18 to 24-year-olds and 25 to 44-year-olds, it is important to consider the factors that may contribute to the size of their households. Typically, individuals between the ages of 18 to 24 are either still living at home with their parents or have recently moved out and are more likely to live with roommates instead of starting a family. This means that the average household size for this age group is generally smaller than those of older age brackets. On the other hand, individuals between the ages of 25 to 44 are often starting families or have already established a family, which means their households are more likely to be larger. However, there are many factors that come into play when determining the size of their households, such as the availability and cost of housing, cultural traditions, and personal preferences. Based on these factors, it is likely that the group for households in the city that is smaller is the 18 to 24 age bracket. However, it is important to keep in mind that household size can vary greatly depending on a variety of factors and should not be assumed based solely on age demographics."},{"prompt":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

While it helps protect us from the virus, it's also important to take care of the mask itself to ensure its effectiveness and longevity. One essential step is to let your mask dry. After wearing a mask, it's essential to wash it properly to remove any germs or bacteria that may have accumulated on it. However, after washing, many people make the mistake of storing the mask away while it's still damp. This can actually create the perfect environment for bacteria to grow, especially if the mask is kept in a closed container. To avoid this, it's important to let your mask dry completely before storing it. Hang it up or lay it out flat in an open, well-ventilated area, preferably in direct sunlight, as the UV rays can help kill any remaining bacteria. Make sure the mask is completely dry to the touch before storing it. Not letting your mask dry properly can also result in an uncomfortable wearing experience. Damp masks can cause skin irritation and make breathing difficult, leading to discomfort during prolonged use. On the other hand, letting your mask dry completely ensures that it's comfortable to wear and reduces the risk of irritation. In conclusion, letting your mask dry completely after washing is an important step in maintaining its hygiene and longevity. It's a simple but crucial process that shouldn't be overlooked in our efforts to stay safe during these uncertain times. Remember, always wear a clean and dry mask when going out to protect both yourself and those around you."},{"prompt":"This is the content of an email: Mary Kay and Greg would like to discuss with you the Sublette Compressor station enforcement by conference call on Wednesday, Oct. 24, at 9:30 am.

Most plants use light to convert inorganic molecules in their environment into carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other biomolecules, characteristically containing reduced carbon in the form of carbonhydrogen bonds. Starting with carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy in the form of simple sugars (e.g., glucose), with the release of molecular oxygen. These sugars are then used as the building blocks for plant growth, including the production of other biomolecules. When an animal eats plants (or eats other animals which have eaten plants), the reduced carbon compounds in the food become a source of energy and building materials for the animal. They are either used directly to help the animal grow, or broken down, releasing stored solar energy, and giving the animal the energy required for motion.

He has appeared in a number of popular dramas and is well-regarded within the industry. The trial is expected to attract significant media attention, given Lancel's high public profile. It will also shine a light on the issue of sexual abuse, which has been a major focus of public debate in recent years. Despite the seriousness of the charges against him, Lancel has maintained his innocence throughout. He has expressed his determination to clear his name and restore his reputation. The case is a reminder that even those in positions of power and influence are not immune from the law. It is also a testament to the bravery of survivors who come forward to share their stories, and to the work of law enforcement agencies who investigate such crimes.

Whether it's a baseball cap, a fedora or a cowboy hat, it is important to clean and maintain it properly. Cleaning a hat is not difficult, but it does require some attention to detail. In this article, we'll go over some tips for cleaning hats to make sure they stay in good condition for years to come. The first step in cleaning a hat is to make sure that it can be cleaned. Some hats, such as those made of felt or suede, can be more difficult to clean and may require special care. It is important to read the care instructions provided with the hat or consult a professional cleaner for guidance. The next step is to remove any extras, such as feathers or flowers, that may be attached to the hat. These can be gently removed to make cleaning easier. If the hat is extremely dusty, a soft-bristled brush can be used to remove the dust gently. For more stubborn dirt or stains, a vacuum can be used with a brush attachment to remove any remaining debris. To clean the hat, a peroxide solution can be used for white hats, as it is a natural whitener. Dilute the peroxide in water, and gently apply the solution to the hat with a soft cloth, making sure to avoid any decorations or embellishments. After applying the solution, use a clean damp cloth to blot the area gently, avoiding rubbing. For colored hats, a soap solution can be used. Mix mild soap, such as dish soap or baby shampoo, in water and apply the solution to the hat with a soft cloth, avoiding any decorations or embellishments. After applying the solution, use a clean damp cloth to blot the area gently, avoiding rubbing. Finally, rinse the hat thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap or peroxide residue. Allow the hat to dry completely in a well-ventilated area, avoiding direct heat or sunlight. In conclusion, with a few simple steps and some attention to detail, cleaning hats should be easy and effective. Taking proper care of your hats not only keeps them looking attractive, but it also extends their lifespan, ensuring you can wear your favorite hats for years to come."},{"prompt":"NEW YORK You could almost hear the sighs of relief when the US Federal Communications Commission ruled on Tuesday that Internetbased phone services should be regulated by the federal government, not by the states.

Shortly before the trade deadline, the Cubs traded Matt Garza to the Texas Rangers for Mike Olt, C. J. Edwards, Neil Ramirez, and Justin Grimm. Three days later, the Cubs sent Alfonso Soriano to the New York Yankees for minor leaguer Corey Black. The mid season fire sale led to another last place finish in the NL Central, finishing with a record of 6696. Although there was a fivegame improvement in the record from the year before, Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro seemed to take steps backward in their development. On September 30, 2013, Theo Epstein made the decision to fire manager Dale Sveum after just two seasons at the helm of the Cubs.

This resurgence of art and culture is a positive sign for the future of the city and the island as a whole. For years, the divided Cyprus has been fraught with tensions between the two communities, and hopes for reconciliation have often felt distant. But as more artists and creatives come to Nicosia, there is a growing sense that the city can begin to heal and move forward. The new cafes and galleries that have opened up in Nicosia are not just symbols of hope, but they are also important spaces for people to come together and share their stories. Through art, music, and poetry, people from both sides of the city can begin to see each other as fellow human beings, rather than as enemies. This shared cultural space is essential for building bridges and promoting understanding, and it is heartening to see it taking root in Nicosia. Of course, there is still much work to be done in Cyprus if it is to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation. The issues that divide the island are complex and long-standing, and they will not be resolved overnight. But the fact that Nicosia is starting to come alive again is a sign of hope that should not be ignored. Ultimately, the return of arts and culture to Nicosia is a cause for celebration. It is a sign that there are people who are committed to building a better future for Cyprus, one where people from both communities can come together and thrive.

This practice does not cause mass casualties, but it has a detrimental psychological impact on the people living in the area. It is not a new tactic, as it was first used by Iraqis in the ancient city of Hatra between 198-199 AD. The Iraqis of Hatra would pack clay pots full of scorpions and hurl them at Roman armies, making use of the creatures’ venom as a form of unconventional warfare. Today, this tactic has evolved to include other dangerous creatures, such as snakes and spiders, and is seen as a way to terrorize and intimidate enemies without causing significant physical harm. However, the psychological effects of this tactic cannot be underestimated. The idea of dangerous and unpredictable creatures being blasted into their homes is a nightmarish scenario that instills fear and anxiety long after the physical threat has passed. It is a reminder of the unpredictable and chaotic nature of war, and it leaves civilians feeling helpless and vulnerable. In modern times, this tactic has been used by various groups in Iraq, including insurgents and terrorist organizations. The canisters are typically launched from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which also pose a significant physical threat to both civilians and soldiers alike. Overall, the use of canisters filled with dangerous creatures in warfare may not cause mass casualties, but it is a brutal and inhumane tactic that inflicts psychological harm and terrorizes innocent civilians. It is a tactic that should not be used by any party in any conflict, as it violates the principles of international law and the Geneva Conventions."},{"prompt":"Write a title: Leaving their orbiting outpost unmanned, the international space station #39;s two astronauts floated outside on a spacewalk Friday, plugging in new antennas and replacing a wornout piece of cooling equipment.","completion":"Title: Astronauts Conduct Spacewalk to Install New Antennas and Replace Cooling Equipment."},{"prompt":"Premise: well it yeah you can't get cash advances Hypothesis: In the future, it may be possible to get cash advances.

If we are referring to the Philippine revolutionary struggle against Spanish colonial rule, Garcia was one of the key military leaders fighting for independence alongside other notable figures such as Emilio Aguinaldo. In this context, Garcia's soldiers first began organizing and mobilizing in the early 1890s, with various uprisings and skirmishes taking place throughout the decade. However, it wasn't until the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898 that the revolutionaries were able to gain significant momentum and push for full independence. During the war, Garcia's forces played a crucial role in fighting off Spanish forces and securing strategic positions in various regions of the Philippines. While it's difficult to pinpoint an exact timeline, it's safe to say that it took several months of intense fighting and maneuvering for Garcia's troops to establish themselves and gain a foothold in the struggle for independence. Overall, the process of establishing a revolutionary movement and military presence is complex and multifaceted, and can't be boiled down to a simple number of months. However, Garcia and his soldiers undoubtedly played a vital role in the fight for Philippine independence, and their efforts and sacrifices helped to pave the way for eventual self-governance and sovereignty."},{"prompt":"BeforetheBell: Chiron Shares Stumble NEW YORK (Reuters) Shares of Chiron Corp. &lt;A HREF=http://www.investor.reuters.com/FullQuote.aspx?ticker=CHIR.O target=/stocks/quickinfo/fullquote&gt;CHIR.O&lt;/A&gt; fell 7 percent before the market open on Friday, a day after the biopharmaceutical company said it is delaying shipment of its flu vaccine, Fluvirin, because lots containing 4 million vaccines do not meet product sterility standards.

If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000–400 cm−1, the midinfrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded.

What started as a small gathering of bikers has grown into a week-long event that attracts a diverse crowd of riders and enthusiasts. Despite past stereotypes of rowdy and unruly behavior, the Bike Week of today is a far cry from those early days. According to Kevin Kilian, Vice President of the Daytona Beach Chamber of Commerce, the traditional Bike Week stereotype “doesn't exist anymore” as the event has evolved over the years. This evolution is thanks in part to a push from city leaders in the 1980s who urged the Chamber of Commerce to clean up Bike Week or cancel it altogether. The Chamber of Commerce took this message to heart and worked with local law enforcement and businesses to create a safer, more family-friendly environment. As a result, Daytona’s Bike Week has become a more inclusive celebration that welcomes riders of all backgrounds and ages. The event has also become more commercialized in recent years, with corporate sponsors and branded merchandise commonplace. Some attendees lament this commercialization, as one notes that “it’s more and more commercial just like everything else nowadays.” However, the event continues to draw hundreds of thousands of people each year who come to experience the unique culture of the biker community and the thrill of the open road. Overall, Daytona’s Bike Week is a celebration of motorcycle culture that has withstood the test of time.

To get started, you'll want to make an appointment with your primary care physician or a specialist, like a hematologist, who can perform the blood draw. Depending on your insurance, you may need to get a referral first. Be sure to ask any questions you may have about the process, such as whether you need to fast beforehand or if you should avoid certain medications. During the blood draw, a healthcare professional will insert a small needle into your vein, usually in your arm, and draw a small sample of your blood. This process only takes a few minutes and is generally painless, though you may feel a slight pinch or discomfort. After the blood draw, you'll typically need to wait 5-7 days for the results to come back. During this time, it's important to continue taking any medications or following any other medical advice your doctor has provided. When you return to discuss the results with your doctor, they will likely review the numbers with you and explain what they mean. They may also recommend any lifestyle changes or medications to help you maintain your health. In the end, getting your blood drawn is a small step you can take towards taking control of your health. By staying informed about your body's function and any potential issues, you can make sure you're doing everything you can to feel your best.

These LED lamps not only save money, but they also change the way night scenes look and how they are filmed. The shift from traditional streetlights to LED lamps is happening at a rapid pace. LED lamps consume significantly less energy than traditional bulbs, which has been a major factor in prompting cities to make the switch. This translates into significant cost savings on energy bills. City administrations are happy to adopt this change as it helps to reduce expenditure and aids in the fight against global warming. Moreover, LED lamps produce white light that is much brighter and clearer than the yellow light of traditional bulbs. This has implications not only for safety on the streets, but also for the way night scenes appear on camera. Filmmakers and photographers are always on the lookout for the perfect lighting and the use of LED lamps can enhance the night-time shots. Apart from these benefits, LED lamps also have a much longer lifespan, which means that they require less maintenance and need to be replaced less frequently. This further lowers the maintenance cost for cities. Many cities have already made the change and are reaping the benefits of the switch to LED lighting.

Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots. Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots. Roots that spread out close to the surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, as is the case with Saintpaulia, or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant. In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots. Q: What happens if a plant looses roots or its shoots?","completion":"If a plant loses its roots, the shoots may not receive water and minerals, ultimately leading to its death. Similarly, if a plant loses its shoots, it won't be able to photosynthesize and produce food, which can also lead to its death.

Take frequent breaks.","completion":"Incorporating Writing into Your Revision: The Key to Effective Studying Studying effectively is a mixture of art and science. Not everyone can master it, but everybody can try. Active studying rather than passive learning is what sets top performers apart. One useful way to stimulate active studying is by incorporating writing into your revision. By doing so, you reinforce important knowledge and create meaningful connections between concepts. Here are some tips to help you incorporate writing into your revision. Set Reasonable Goals Effective studying has a lot to do with having the right attitude. Set goals that are ambitious yet reasonable. Make to-do lists or brain maps to organize your thoughts and tasks. This helps you structure your time and prevents overloading your brain with complex tasks. Take Frequent Breaks Your brain can only handle so much information at a time. Studies show that it takes around 20-25 minutes for the human brain to reach peak cognitive efficiency. Take breaks at regular intervals to allow your brain to recharge. Stimulate More than One Sense Do not limit your studying to reading and note-taking. Engage multiple senses to reinforce learning. For example, you can use flashcards to visualize concepts, listen to audio recordings, or watch informative videos. Use Active Forms of Studying Active studying is all about engaging your brain, not just reading the same text over and over again. Use writing to test yourself on what you have learned. Write down summaries and explanations of topics, quiz yourself through flashcards. Doing so keeps your mind engaged and can help you retain information. Incorporating writing into your revision is a skill like any other- it takes time to perfect. By setting reasonable goals, taking breaks, using multiple senses, and being active, you can make the most of your study time. Remember, practice makes perfect- and with active studying, you have the power to make it so."},{"prompt":"Since Isaac Newton (16421727) around 1660 discovered the mathematical laws for gravitational forces between two symmetrical, ball shaped bodies, scientists have tried to find a physicalmechanical cause for the gravitational effects.

Get the IMEI code. Take note of the IMEI code.","completion":"Article: Why Taking Note of Your Phone's IMEI Code is Important Your phone's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code is a unique identifier that can help you in various ways. Whether you're troubleshooting a technical issue, seeking warranty service, or reporting a lost or stolen device, having your IMEI code handy can speed up the process and improve your chances of a positive outcome. To find your phone's IMEI code, simply turn on your phone and dial *#06#. This will bring up a 15-digit number that represents your phone's IMEI. You can also find the IMEI code on the back of your phone, inside the SIM card tray, or in the settings menu of your phone. Once you have located your phone's IMEI code, it's important to take note of it and keep it in a safe place. This can be as simple as writing it down on a piece of paper or saving it in a text message or note on your phone. By doing this, you can easily access your IMEI code when you need it, without having to scramble through paperwork or search online. Here are some scenarios where having your phone's IMEI code can be useful: - Technical support: If you're experiencing an issue with your phone, such as poor signal strength or a frozen screen, the technician may ask for your IMEI code to help diagnose the problem. By providing this information upfront, you can save time and potentially resolve the issue more quickly. - Warranty service: If your phone is still under warranty and requires repairs, the manufacturer may request your IMEI code as proof of purchase. This helps to ensure that your phone is still covered under warranty and that you're eligible for free repairs or replacements. - Insurance claims: If your phone is lost, stolen or damaged, you may need to file an insurance claim to get reimbursed for the cost of a replacement device. Your insurance company may ask for your IMEI code as a way to confirm that the device is indeed yours and that you're eligible for coverage. - Law enforcement: If your phone is stolen, reporting your IMEI code to the police can help them track down the device and potentially apprehend the thief. The IMEI code can be used to block the phone from being used on any network or sold illegally. In conclusion, taking note of your phone's IMEI code is a simple but important step that can save you a lot of hassle in the long run. By keeping this information handy, you can streamline the process of troubleshooting issues, seeking warranty service, filing insurance claims, and reporting lost or stolen devices."},{"prompt":"The world can be divided into three climate zones.

This marked the end of the United States' military presence in Iraq, nearly nine years after the invasion in 2003. The withdrawal of the troops was part of an agreement between the US and Iraqi governments, which aimed to transfer the security responsibilities to Iraqi forces. In the years that followed the invasion, the US military had faced significant challenges in stabilizing the country and in establishing an effective government. The sectarian violence that had erupted after the fall of Saddam Hussein had claimed countless lives and made it difficult for the occupying forces to maintain control over the country. Despite these challenges, the US military continued to work towards their mission of stabilizing the country and preparing Iraqi forces to take over. In the final years of the occupation, the focus was on training and equipping the Iraqi security forces. The withdrawal of US troops from Iraq was a contentious issue in both countries. In the US, there were strong opinions on both sides of the debate. Some argued that the troops should remain until Iraq was completely stable, while others felt that the US had overstayed its welcome and that the troops should be brought home. In Iraq, there were also differing opinions. Some saw the withdrawal of US troops as a positive step towards greater sovereignty, while others feared that the country was not yet ready to fend for itself. Regardless of the opinions, the fact remains that the last Marines departed from Iraq on December 18, 2011, bringing an end to almost a decade of military occupation.
