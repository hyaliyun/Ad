Algo similar a esto: \`\`\`typescript import { FormGroup, FormBuilder, Validators } from '@angular/forms'; @Component({ // Component metadata }) export class MyComponent { frmDetalleVenta: FormGroup; constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) { this.frmDetalleVenta = this.fb.group({ cantidad: ['', Validators.required], // Se agrega la validación \\"required\\" iddescuento: ['', Validators.required] }); } // Resto del componente... } \`\`\` En este ejemplo, utilizamos el FormBuilder para crear el formulario y asignamos una validación \\"required\\" al campo \\"cantidad\\" y \\"iddescuento\\". Esto significa que ambos campos son obligatorios y no se permitirá enviar el formulario si alguno de ellos está vacío. Luego, en el HTML, puedes mostrar mensajes de error o estilos visuales personalizados para indicar que estos campos son obligatorios. Puedes acceder a los controles del formulario y verificar su validez en tu método \`submit()\` antes de enviar los datos al servidor. \`\`\`html <div class=\\"row mb-2\\"> <label class=\\"col-sm-5 col-form-label\\" for=\\"cantidad\\">Cantidad</label> <div class=\\"col-sm-7\\"> <input type=\\"number\\" class=\\"form-control\\" id=\\"cantidad\\" formControlName=\\"cantidad\\" required> <div *ngIf=\\"frmDetalleVenta.controls.cantidad.invalid && frmDetalleVenta.controls.cantidad.touched\\"> <small class=\\"text-danger\\">La cantidad es obligatoria.</small> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\\"row mb-2\\"> <label class=\\"col-sm-5 col-form-label\\" for=\\"iddescuento\\">Descuento</label> <div class=\\"col-sm-7\\"> <select class=\\"form-select\\" id=\\"iddescuento\\" formControlName=\\"iddescuento\\" required> <option value=\\"\\">- - - - - - - - Seleccionar - - - - - - - -</option> <option *ngFor=\\"let d of descuentos\\" [value]=\\"d.iddescuento\\"> {{d.descripcion}} </option> </select> <div *ngIf=\\"frmDetalleVenta.controls.iddescuento.invalid && frmDetalleVenta.controls.iddescuento.touched\\"> <small class=\\"text-danger\\">El descuento es obligatorio.</small> </div> </div> </div> \`\`\` En este ejemplo, agregamos una validación visual que muestra un mensaje de error debajo de cada campo si está vacío y se ha tocado (es decir, el usuario hizo clic o interactuó con el campo y luego lo dejó vacío).

Crear un formulario en HTML con los campos necesarios para ambas tablas. 2. Configurar el \`FormGroup\` correspondiente en tu componente de Angular. 3. Obtener los valores del formulario en el método \`submit()\` y utilizarlos para insertar los registros en las tablas correspondientes. A continuación, te mostraré un ejemplo de cómo podrías implementar esto: 1. HTML: \`\`\`html <form [formGroup]=\\"frmRegistro\\" (ngSubmit)=\\"submit()\\"> <div class=\\"form-group\\"> <label for=\\"nombre\\">Nombre</label> <input type=\\"text\\" formControlName=\\"nombre\\" id=\\"nombre\\" class=\\"form-control\\" required> </div> <div class=\\"form-group\\"> <label for=\\"email\\">Email</label> <input type=\\"email\\" formControlName=\\"email\\" id=\\"email\\" class=\\"form-control\\" required> </div> <div class=\\"form-group\\"> <label for=\\"direccion\\">Dirección</label> <input type=\\"text\\" formControlName=\\"direccion\\" id=\\"direccion\\" class=\\"form-control\\" required> </div> <button type=\\"submit\\" class=\\"btn btn-primary\\">Registrar</button> </form> \`\`\` 2.

Las validaciones también se agregan utilizando \`Validators.required\` para asegurar que los campos sean obligatorios. En el método \`submit()\`, se obtienen los valores del formulario utilizando \`this.frmRegistro.value\`. Luego, esos valores se pasan como parámetros a los métodos \`insertarRegistroTabla1()\` y \`insertarRegistroTabla2()\` que son responsables de insertar los registros en las tablas correspondientes.

A continuación, se realiza una solicitud POST al endpoint \`this.url_detventa\` enviando los datos del detalle como cuerpo de la solicitud. Sin embargo, hay un problema en este código. La solicitud POST se realiza dentro del ciclo \`for\`, lo que significa que se realizará una solicitud por cada producto seleccionado. Esto puede no ser óptimo y puede llevar a múltiples inserciones en la tabla de detalles de venta. Una posible solución para evitar este problema es crear un array de detalles y enviarlo en una única solicitud POST.

Next on the list was Sawatari Ginbei Haruomi, the daughter [Ginbei] of [Ginbei's parents] Akito’s adoptive parents and thus Akito’s adoptive little sister [Ginbei]. Silver-haired, short with bright green eyes and with a boyish way of talking [Ginbei], Ginbei disguised herself [Ginbei] as a boy and joined Akito’s class to get closer to her [Ginbei’s] beloved big brother [Akito], while passing off her [Akito] closeness to him as her [Ginbei’s] being his [Akito’s] childhood friend [Ginbei in the eyes of the world].

There, a man of a calm demeanor, Himenokōji Akito, was lost in a contemplation as profound as the horizon where sky met sea. His hands moved methodically, hanging damp clothing upon the waiting line, the rhythm of the work a soothing counterpoint to his internal reflections. It was a life unexpected, woven from strands of love and choices that defied the norms. As Akito glanced back, that life was embodied by a tableau of nurturing warmth; the women who held his heart cradled the blossoming future in their arms—his children. First among them was Akiko, his twin sister, whose deep affection never wavered, whose confession of love was as startling in its intensity as it was tender. She gently rocked a tiny cradle with her foot, humming a lullaby only a mother’s heart could conceive. Beside her, Sawatari Ginbei Haruomi, the manifestation of dedication personified, fretted over her newborn with a mixture of awe and a quiet, nagging doubt. She met Akito's eyes and conveyed a silent plea for reassurance, which he answered with a soft, comforting smile that spanned the distance. In the riotous frolic of lively conversation, Takanomiya Arisa animatedly told stories to her infant, her voice a vibrant melody amidst the laughter. \\"And so, my little one,\\" she said with a twinkle in her eye, \\"your Uncle Akito might just be the best in the world.\\" Anatasia Nasuhara, her features a canvas of northern beauty, sat with a serenade of peace across her countenance. She watched her child with an intensity born of fears beyond their sanctuary—worries of chasing shadows and echoing footsteps. But in this moment, there was only love and the protective circle they had formed together. Nikaidō Arashi and <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, each a strength in her own right, exchanged tales of motherhood, their bond as co-mothers and co-lovers deepening with every shared experience. Their children, a trio of hope and tomorrow, squirmed and cooed in their embrace. The air was thick with contentment, the scent of budding life, and the echoes of laughter intertwined with the soft symphony of nature. This was fulfillment—a mosaic of diverse spirits finding harmony in a chorus of union and shared destiny. Then came the patter of feet, the murmur of excited voices, as Akiko's school friends arrived. Each bore the glow of impending motherhood, their bellies round with the promise of life, with children sired by the man they all cherished. Akiko greeted them, her voice a chime of fond recognition. \\"Welcome, my friends! Come, join the assembly of this burgeoning family!\\" As they settled, talk turned to the whispers of vigilantism that snaked through the country. It manifested as a cloaked figure, a specter delivering justice where the law seemed blind. Concern etched their brows, yet they trusted in the safety of their sanctuary. Unseen to all, perched high amongst the delicate blossoms of a nearby cherry tree, was another player in life's grand drama—Ichika Orimura. A roguish grin danced across his face as he observed the domestic serenity below. His life had once been a cacophony of expectations and misunderstandings, but no longer. He was the whispered ghost, the guardian embracing shadows to fight for a brighter day. Once certain the mansion and its inhabitants were shielded from prying eyes, he vanished, a specter borne on the wings of light. A phantom protector, his presence was a secret wrapped in the hush of midsummer, his life a solitary vigil in the name of a justice all his own. For Akito, each passing day wove new threads into the fabric of a life rich with unexpected joys. Amongst wet linens and cooing babies, he found a rhythm that pulsed with the heartbeat of home, of shared ardor, and a future as open as the sky above. Here, in the cloistered confines of love's own architecture, expectation met fulfillment, and happiness unfolded with the dawn of each new day. The promise of tomorrow cradled in every smile, in every touch, and every whispered vow. And although each heart harbored its own worries, together they stood unshakeable—a fortress of affection against the tide of an ever-changing world."},{"prompt":"Naruto x Freedom planet: Freedom planet characters and Naruto characters react to Naruto and Lilac are having a argument, so the only way to settle to matter is to have a race.

Next on the list was Sawatari Ginbei Haruomi, the daughter [Ginbei] of [Ginbei's parents] Akito’s adoptive parents and thus Akito’s adoptive little sister [Ginbei]. Silver-haired, short with bright green eyes and with a boyish way of talking [Ginbei], Ginbei disguised herself [Ginbei] as a boy and joined Akito’s class to get closer to her [Ginbei’s] beloved big brother [Akito], while passing off her [Akito] closeness to him as her [Ginbei’s] being his [Akito’s] childhood friend [Ginbei in the eyes of the world]. Ginbei has since returned to her [Ginbei’s] true self as a cute girl ever since she [Ginbei’s] and the other girls confessed their [the girls of Akito’s harem’s] love to Akito, but [Ginbei] worries about being a good mother to her [Ginbei] newborn baby girl.

She [Anatasia] fell in love with Akito after he [Akito] unknowingly saved her[Anatasia] from a death squad sent by the CIA. Anatasia is extremely elated to be one of Akito’s wives and one of the mothers of his [Akito’s] children but is rightly concerned about vengeful government forces finding out their location. The list was finished off by Nikaidō Arashi, the brash and cocky red-headed, amber-eyed and large-chested Student Council President [Arashi] of Akito’s school and Akito’s older cousin [Arashi] who [who Arashi is] carried around a katana as a symbol of her [Arashi’s] noble samurai heritage, and Jinno Kaoruko, the brunette, brown-eyed and busty editor of the company who published Akito’s books. Arashi gave birth to twin boys and Kaoruka gave birth to a girl, and both girls [Arashi and Kaoruka] love their [Arashi’s and Kaoruka’s] children as much as they [Arashi and Kaoruka] love Akito. The mood of the story should be one of expectation, fulfillment, and happiness, as the girls and Akito get used to their new lives as parents. Expectation, fulfillment, and happiness are the main emotions at play as the girls [Akiko, Ginbei, Anatasia, Arisa/'Alice, Kaoruka] and Akito get used to their new lives as parents and grow to love each other [Akito and the girls] more. Although Ginbei is still worried about fulfilling her responsibilities and Anatasia about being chased by vengeful government agents, the girls [Akiko, Ginbei, Anatasia, Arisa/'Alice, Kaoruka] are quite happy with being the mothers of Akito’s many children as well as being his [Akito’s] loving wives. Eventually, Akiko’s friends from her [Akiko’s], Anatasia’s, Ginbei’s, and Arashi’s time as students at the prestigious St. Lilianna’s Academy eventually come over to the back porch where Akito and his [Akito’s] wives are at, [Akiko’s friends] heavily pregnant with Akito’s unborn children. Akiko’s mood is chipper as she greets her friends, and they [Akiko and her friends] discuss the events in their lives while also expressing worry about a series of vigilante incidents popping up across Japan. Meanwhile, Ichika Orimura, the black-haired, red-eyed protagonist of Infinite Stratos, who [Ichika] is [Ichika] heavily implied [Ichika] to be the vigilante [Ichika’s alter ego in this story]. after [Ichika] faking his [Ichika’s] death after [Ichika] being frustrated with his [Ichika’s] life at the IS Academy and the abuse he [Ichika] received from both his [Ichika’s] older sister Orimura Chifuyu and his [Ichika’s] harem at the IS Academy, [Ichika] watching the whole thing with an amused look on his [Ichika’s] face from the safety of a nearby tree before [Ichika] vanishing in a flash of light, [Ichika] heading to an undisclosed location to [Ichika] continue his [Ichika’s] fight against crime, his [Ichika’s] presence unnoticed by either Akito or his [Akito’s] wives [Akiko, Ginbei, Anatasia, Arisa/'Alice, Kaoruka] and [Akito’s] consorts [Akiko’s friends].","completion":"Amidst the gentle fluttering of freshly washed linens, Himenokōji Akito stretched out his arms, wading through a simple chore that he found surprisingly therapeutic. Sheets billowed like sails on the line, framing the picturesque scene of laughter and whispered conversations on the back veranda of the stately mansion. His focus drifted in and out, intertwined with the musings on the life he had carved out for himself—a tapestry as complex and vibrant as the floral patterns on the yukata his twin sister, Akiko, was fond of wearing. Akito smiled to himself as he watched Akiko cradle her baby with a love that radiated from her like a beacon, her laughter mingling with the others. Her hair fluttered softly in the breeze, carrying whispers of their shared past into the present, where she sat beaming with maternal pride. \\"Big brother, can you believe how lucky we are?\\" Akiko's voice, tender and warm, cut through Akito's reverie. \\"Our family has grown so wonderfully.\\" \\"Luck had little to do with it,\\" Akito replied with that characteristic lazy grin curving his lips. \\"It was love, and I believe a bit of stubborn perseverance as well.\\" Ginbei, once boyish and discerning in her own unique way, was now a striking figure of gentle femininity, despite the tomboyish glean that still blinked in her eyes. She held her daughter close, affection in every touch, although her gaze carried traces of worry. \\"I just hope I can be a good mother to her,\\" Ginbei confessed quietly to Akiko, who gave her a comforting squeeze on the shoulder. \\"Your love is more than enough, Ginbei,\\" Akiko reassured. “That love has brought us all here, and it's what will guide us in raising them.” Not far from the sisters, Anastasia Nasuhara, her origins as varied and intriguing as the icy lands of her ancestors, tilted her head in perplexed observation of a butterfly perching on the porch railing. Her son, resting in his bassinet beside her, seemed to follow his mother's gaze, reaching out with dimpled hands. \\"I never thought that such a chaotic world would grant us this peace,\\" Anatasia mused aloud, her soft inquiry almost lost in the rustle of the leaves. She lifted the baby into her arms, and the concern about the lurking shadows of her past seemed to ebb away, if only for a moment. \\"The world changes,\\" Akito offered from his spot by the laundry line, \\"and we change with it. But right here, right now, this is our sanctuary.\\" Arashi and Kaoruko joined the gentle murmur of voices, their children nestled against them like precious jewels in a crown. Arashi's twins squirmed with a vigor matching their mother's fiery spirit, while Kaoruko's daughter observed the scene with eyes wide and curious. \\"Never a dull moment with these rascals,\\" Arashi chuckled, her maternal glow rivaling the setting sun dipping beneath the horizon. \\"They're spirited like their mother,\\" Akito quipped, earning a mock scowl from Arashi. \\"Oh, you adore it,\\" she retorted, but her amber eyes held a wealth of tenderness. Kaoruko, always one to steer the conversation, remarked, \\"We ought to write a book about this—'Life Amongst Chaos: A Tale of Love and Unity.' We've certainly got enough material.\\" \\"The tale's still being written,\\" Akito said, hanging the last shirt on the line. He turned to gaze upon his family—a mosaic of lifelong bonds and newfound connections. Chatter erupted anew as Akiko's friends from St. Lilianna's Academy arrived, each embracing the joys and challenges of impending motherhood and carrying the same spark of life within. Their conversation danced from the lighthearted to the serious, lingering on the mysterious vigilante that had become the talk of the nation. As the evening settled into twilight, fulfilling its daily promise, the laughter on the veranda twisted harmoniously with the soft whispers of nature and the secret musings of a solitary figure perched in a nearby tree. Ichika Orimura, the masked avenger whispered about in alleyways and on social media, observed the scene with a silent amusement, his presence unnoticed. He was a shadow painted against the canvas of the growing night, his thoughts as enigmatic as the road he walked. His life, once entwined with the rhythm of mechs and the pressure of the IS Academy, had taken a turn toward solitary justice. It was a harsher melody, but it resonated within him, validating his choice. With one last glance at the warm lights casting gold onto the faces of Akito's family, Ichika vanished, his figure becoming one with the dusk—a ghost adrift in the ebb and flow of fate. There on the veranda, the mood was none the wiser to the specter's silent departure, brimming instead with the echoes of expectation, fulfillment, and happiness. It was life, unabashed and unstoppable, in all its chaotic, beautiful splendor."},{"prompt":"Write a fully detailed story about a man having a lucid dream, and creating people and cities.","completion":"In the quiet town of Crescent Bay, there lived a man named Alexander. By day, he was an unassuming librarian, his gentle demeanor and quiet steps echoing through the halls lined with endless books and ancient tomes. But by night, Alexander became an explorer, a creator, a god of his own realm within the vast expanse of his subconscious. For as long as he could remember, Alexander had possessed a unique gift: the ability to lucid dream at will. This meant he had the power to be aware of his dream state and could manipulate the surreal landscape of his dreams to his heart's content. It was a respite from his colorless world, a sandbox for his boundless imagination. One particular night, as a soft drizzle played a percussive lullaby on his windowpane, Alexander closed his eyes and let the familiar symphony of sleep envelop him. Gradually, the palpable reality melted away, and when he opened his eyes again, he found himself standing in the midst of a vast empty field. He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, focusing his mind on his first creation. Underneath his feet, the barren land began to tremble and rise. It undulated like waves, molding into cobbled streets and passages that branched out like roots of an ancient tree. Buildings crafted from the bedrock of his consciousness spiraled skyward, with delicate archways and ornate balconies. Alexander conjured a city center, a marvel of his own design. A grand plaza paved with colored marble unfolded, and at its heart, a fountain emerged. Water cascaded from the mouth of a stone-carved dragon, catching the light of a sun that was his to command. He shaped trees and parks, populating them with fantastical flora that shimmered with unearthly hues and exuded sweet, hypnotic fragrances. Once the city stood majestic and alive, Alexander turned his attention to its inhabitants. With a wave of his hand, he imbued the empty streets with the buzz of life. People materialized from the warmth of his thoughts, each given attributes and personalities as Alexander whispered their stories into existence. There were merchants hawking exotic wares that Alexander crafted from the essence of dreamstuff, bakers whose pastries filled the air with divine aromas, and artists painting murals on the city walls that shifted and danced with the viewer's emotions. He created scholars debating in the squares, children playing with laughter that rang pure and clear, and lovers sharing tender glances imbued with a love that could only be born in dreams. A particular figure caught his eye—a woman with hair like spun silver and eyes reflecting the myriad colors of his artificial dawn. She was his favorite, born from the deepest desires of his heart, to wander by his side through every dream. They walked together, exploring the alleyways and bridges. She held his hand, her touch a phantom sensation that felt real enough to make his heart ache. As he created, Alexander poured more of himself into the world, each addition leaving him in a state of tranquil fulfillment. His cities grew, became more complex, teeming with life that ticked along to a rhythm that echoed the steady beating of his heart. Hours passed, or perhaps it was minutes—or even seconds—time always held little meaning here. Eventually, though, a subtle shift in the air signaled the encroach of reality. Alexander's vision blurred, the sounds and colors of his dream city fading as the warmth of morning sunbeams fought to pry open his eyelids. With a certain reluctance, he gently disentangled his dream-self from the hand of the silver-haired woman, his creation, his companion. He whispered a promise to return as the world he created dissolved into the rising mists of consciousness. Alexander awoke in his modest bedroom with a soft sigh, the phantom echoes of his dream city resonating within him. Though it disappeared with daylight, it was never truly gone—it remained, a hidden metropolis waiting patiently in the endless possibilities of his dreaming mind, where a man could be a creator of worlds, a weaver of destinies, each and every night."},{"prompt":"Write a fully detailed hour long story with natural, subtle dialogue about a young man, who doesn’t know why his mind is so troubled with politics and other things, deciding to use lucid dreaming to explore and understand his mind.

Every tick-tock echoed Lucas's inner turmoil—a maze of political debates, unease about the future, and the ever-growing pile of societal pressures resting on his shoulders. Across the cluttered table scattered with books and papers, sat Emma, his childhood friend and confidante. She sipped her chamomile tea, a somber look drawing out the creases on her forehead. \\"Why do you let all this stuff get to you, Lucas? Politics? Global issues? You're just one person,\\" she said softly, watching him fidget. \\"I wish I knew, Emma. It’s like my mind is this battleground where every thought demands to be heard,\\" Lucas replied, his voice tinged with frustration. He ran his fingers through his hair, a gesture she recognized as his telltale sign of anxiety. \\"You need to escape for a while,\\" she suggested, placing her hand over his. \\"Remember how you used to talk about lucid dreaming? Maybe it's time to dive back in, explore your mind.\\" Lucas’s eyes sparked with a forgotten curiosity. \\"Maybe you're right,\\" he conceded. **Chapter 2: Homeward Bound** The next few days, Lucas immersed himself in lucid dreaming guides, meditation, and techniques to achieve self-awareness in dreams. His nightly quest was met with determination, an attempt to confront his inner chaos head-on. One evening, as the city's hum dulled into a nightly lullaby, Lucas settled into bed. Every muscle relaxed, breaths deep and rhythmic, and with purpose, he slipped into the stream of his subconscious. **Chapter 3: The Dreamscape** Lush, green fields stretching out to a sapphire horizon greeted Lucas. He blinked, feeling the gentle tug of a dream beneath his feet. With a swift realization, he recognized this was his realm to explore. He was lucid. \\"Where to first?\\" he murmured to himself. The wind seemed to whisper back, guiding him toward a dense, primeval forest where the trees thrummed with political slogans. **Chapter 4: The Forest of Voices** Inside, each tree bore a screen, a leaflet, a carved rhetoric. Voices clamored for his attention, echoing sentiments he knew all too well. He reached out, tendrils of arguments pulling at him, but he remained rooted. \\"Show me why you're here,\\" he demanded calmly. The forest fell silent. *Uncertainty,* it seemed to breathe, *the fear of standing by while the world moves without you.* Understanding crept in, but Lucas pressed on, deeper into his mind’s geography. **Chapter 5: River of Consciousness** Lucas emerged by the banks of a glistening river—its waters murkily swirling with half-formed opinions and beliefs. Each ripple reflected a mirrored version of himself, debating and rebutting. He found a boat and decided to navigate the tide, steering through the currents of his conscience. As he rowed, the reflections merged, unifying into a coherent image of Lucas, *the observer.* \\"Stay conscious, stay critical,\\" he spoke to the water, his voice surprisingly firm. **Chapter 6: Echoes of Influence** Beyond the river lay a city made of echo chambers; here, everyone he met insisted on their standpoint as absolute. Yet, as he walked through these mirrored alleyways, Lucas discovered pathways leading out—paths marked with dialogue and empathy. He realized these were other aspects of himself, ones that fostered understanding rather than division. It was a crucial revelation that within his mind, there was space for all voices, and that perspective was key. **Chapter 7: The Summit of Clarity** The dream city tapered to a single mountain at its heart. Feeling an instinctual pull, Lucas began the ascent. Voices from below faded as he climbed higher, leaving behind noise for serene quiet. At the peak, under the gossamer night sky of his subconscious, Lucas understood. The landscape he traversed—all of it was his making, his insecurities, his desires for inclusion, and his part in the world's canvas. \\"I am the sum of my thoughts, but I choose which ones to give power,\\" he spoke aloud, a vow etched in the dreamscape. **Chapter 8: Dawn of Realization** Lucas awakened, not with a start but with gentle awareness. The first beams of daybreak cast a soft glow across his room. Emma's name flashed on his phone screen. \\"You were right,\\" he texted her, an anchor to the experience he'd lived through the night. \\"About?\\" her reply came swiftly. \\"Needing an escape. I needed to wander within to find my way out. We’ll talk more at breakfast.” **Epilogue: The Waking World** Over breakfast at their favorite diner, Lucas recounted his odyssey. \\"It feels ridiculous, but my dream taught me to moderate my thoughts, to understand their roots. I suppose I knew that deep down, just needed to see it for myself.\\" Emma raised her coffee cup in a toast. \\"To self-discovery, inner peace, and the power of our minds,\\" she smiled, her eyes glinting with pride. Lucas returned the smile, feeling more grounded than he had in years. Because now, when the world outside became too loud, he could close his eyes and remember the journey through his psyche, the lucid dream where he had found a blueprint for balance and the reassurance that within him lay the tools to navigate life's din—both waking and dreaming."},{"prompt":"START OF PREVIOUS DISCUSSION END OF PREVIOUS DISCUSSION user: tu peu traduire en anglais \\"quelle est la valeur du bitcoin aujourdhui?\\"","completion":"What is the value of Bitcoin today?"},{"prompt":"Conception de la recherche sur la construction du modele predictif de cancer de sein à l’aide de CNN","completion":"Titre de la recherche : \\"Conception d'un modèle prédictif du cancer du sein à l'aide de réseaux de neurones convolutifs (CNN)\\" Résumé : Dans cette étude, nous proposons de concevoir un modèle prédictif du cancer du sein en utilisant des réseaux de neurones convolutifs (CNN).

For each math step taken on the left, explain in detail your reasoning/thought process below. Define the variables Set up the equation Solve for t Interpret the result Let t represent the number of tickets sold. The total earnings E can be expressed as E = 6t + 1500 . Given the goal of 5100, the equation becomes 6t + 1500 = 5100 . Subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate 6t , then divide by 6 to find t . The band needs to sell 600 tickets to reach the 5100 goal. Begin by reminding your reader of your linear equation problem in context The band is performing at an auditorium for a fee of 1500. Additionally, they receive money from ticket sales, initially priced at 6 per ticket. The goal is to determine how many tickets they must sell to make a total of 5100.

Define the variables: In order to solve the problem, we need to define the variables. Here, we are using \\"t\\" to represent the number of tickets sold. 2. Set up the equation: We know that the total earnings E can be expressed as E = 6t + 1500. This equation represents the earnings from ticket sales (6t) plus the flat fee of 1500. 3. Solve for t: The goal is to find the number of tickets they must sell to make a total of 5100. So, we substitute E with the goal amount of 5100 in the equation: 6t + 1500 = 5100. 4. Interpret the result: To solve the equation, we first subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate 6t, so we have 6t = 5100 - 1500. Then, we divide both sides by 6 to find t. This gives us t = (5100 - 1500) / 6 = 600 / 6 = 100. The result shows that the band needs to sell 100 tickets to reach the goal of 5100."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

Once he enters the dream, he politely asks the dream to create an adventure that he could go on, encountering characters and places that represent his truest thoughts on things. As he goes on this adventure, he meets a rugged, muscular warrior woman, slightly older than him, who sticks with him the whole way. They have many moments, battles, quiet moments, falling in love, and eventually getting married, growing old, and dying, the man waking up, soothed.","completion":"Title: A Journey Within Act I: Awakening the Dreamer The crisp, azure sky poured morning light into the cluttered bedroom of Caleb, a young man beset by a restless mind. Resting uneasily between towers of books on political theory, psychology, and philosophy, Caleb rubbed at his eyes and begrudgingly greeted the day. The night had been long and fraught with twisted visions of debates, rallies, and an endless cycle of news that relentlessly clawed at his consciousness. As he sat on the edge of his bed, Caleb contemplated the torrent of thoughts that flooded his mind day and night. Who was he amid the political chaos? What was his place in an ever-changing world? He felt paralyzed, the weight of his concerns dragging him to the depths of uncertainty. That afternoon, Caleb met his old friend, Adrian, at a sun-drenched café. It took little prompting for Caleb to spill his troubles. Adrian listened intently, stirring his coffee as Caleb's voice became a warbled stream of worries. \\"You're too immersed in it, mate,\\" Adrian said, his voice steady and sure. \\"Have you ever tried to get away from it all without actually going anywhere?\\" Caleb raised a puzzled brow. \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"Lucid dreaming.\\" Adrian’s eyes sparkled with intrigue. \\"It's like being awake in your dream. You can control what happens. Maybe it's a way to sort through the noise.\\" Caleb mulled over the idea. \\"I'm willing to try anything at this point,\\" he admitted. That night, Caleb prepared for sleep with an uncharacteristic reverence. He lay in bed, performing the breathing exercises Adrian had recommended. In, hold, out. With each breath, the real world seemed to dissolve. As he drifted into slumber, Caleb's last conscious thought was a polite request to his mind: \\"Show me my adventure.\\" Act II: The Dream Begins Colors and sensations bloomed around Caleb as the dream coalesced. He found himself standing in a vibrant forest, where light danced through the leaves in playful patterns. He felt serene—more so than he had in years. \\"Alright, dream. Let's see what you've got,\\" Caleb murmured, his curiosity piqued. A path unveiled itself, winding into the heart of the woods. Caleb followed, his senses heightened. That's when he met her—a warrior woman with scars and a presence that commanded the very air around her. Hair like woven fire, she turned to face him, introducing herself as Elara. \\"Why are you here?\\" she asked. Caleb explained his quest, and Elara nodded. \\"Then we journey together.\\" Act III: Exploring the Mind's Landscape Their adventure unfolded in vivid detail. They battled nightmares that took the form of pundits and ideologies waged with tooth and claw. In every victory, Caleb felt a weight uplifted, his understanding deepening. Quieter moments revealed intricate truths. Elara proved a reflective companion. In her, Caleb found the embodiment of strength and conviction, a balance to his indecisiveness. \\"You need to be your champion,\\" she told him as they rested by a dream-crafted stream. Night after night, Caleb returned to the dream. The forests gave way to cities, and deserts to oceans—each environment a new aspect of his psyche to explore.inks.shifted..timedelta.curious troubleof.baristas.opinions.reverence.recommended piqued.commanded.hair.quiet Elara was always there, her insights cutting through his confusion like a sword through brambles. They debated, they laughed, and in time, they loved. It was effortless, the way their connection grew, a dream without an end in sight. Act IV: Love and Understanding Their love was a crescendo that echoed through the dreamscapes. They fought side by side, their bond a bulwark against the dark vestiges of doubt and fear in Caleb's mind. Together, they built a lifetime within the span of dreams—raising a family, fostering peace in a once-chaotic realm. They celebrated victories and mourned losses, their souls entwined in a narrative that transcended the ephemerality of sleep. With each night's passing, Caleb's love for Elara deepened, and his waking hours were infused with a clarity he had never known. The turmoil of political strife and societal expectation fell away, leaving only the profound realization of self. Act V: The Final Dream A long life spent within the realm of dreams led them finally to old age. As they lay side by side, Caleb understood the true journey was about to conclude. Elara, the warrior who had been a constant, smiled softly. \\"You've found what you sought, Caleb. You know who you are now,\\" she whispered. Tears lined his cheeks as the world of dreams began to fade. \\"Are you just a dream?\\" Caleb asked, voice trembling. Elara's expression was serene. \\"I'm as real as the wisdom you've discovered within yourself. I am you, the part you needed to find.\\" With that, Caleb awoke. The room was washed in the pale light of dawn. A sense of peace enveloped him, a balm for his troubled mind. He was armed now with an inner stillness and strength that he knew would guide him through life's waking trials. It was the end of the dream but the beginning of everything else."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base...) New Jersey: \\"Phew! Finally, a day where I can relax.

He preferred to take life at his own, often languid, pace. So, on a particularly snowy afternoon in Snowdin, he thought nothing of taking a leisurely stroll through the white-tipped trees and frosty paths that crinkled crisply under his sneaker-clad feet. It was during this walk that Sans encountered something that even his laid-back attitude couldn't shrug off as normal: a magnificent flying train, shimmering with enchantment, chugged gently through the air above him. It hung there, suspended on nothing but the sparkle of magic and steam. The train's conductor, a sprightly figure donning a cap decorated with twinkling stars, leaned out of the window. \\"Hey there, traveler!\\" the conductor called out to Sans. \\"All aboard the Dimension Express, where we take you to anywhere, any place, and any time!\\" Sans, his interest piqued, adjusted his hoodie and grinned cheekily. \\"heh, sounds like quite the ride. alright, buddy, take me to zootopia on christmas 2016. i've heard they throw some wild holiday parties.\\" The conductor squinted, mishearing Sans's drawl in the echo of the falling snow. With a tip of his cap he chirped, \\"One ticket to Zootopia, Christmas 1999, coming right up!\\" Before Sans could correct him, the train whistled a melodious tune, and he felt himself whisked up into the cozy carriage. Upon arrival in Zootopia, 1999, Sans blinked at the sight before him. The Zootopia he knew was a bustling modern metropolis, but this... this was Zootopia with a nostalgic twist. Neon signs flickered with Y2K warnings and millennium excitement. Young Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde were mere kits and cubs, respectively, and the city pulsed with retro vibes. Confused yet curious, Sans sauntered through the streets, taking in the sights of holiday shoppers bustling amongst stores adorned with tinsel and the sound of jingle bells. He saw a young Judy, her eyes aglow with determination as she scribbled down her dream of becoming a police officer in her notebook. Nick, on the other side of the lane, was trying to sell homemade pawpsicles with a junior hustler's grin that was too charming for his own good. Sans chuckled to himself, \\"Kids will be kids, no matter where – or when – ya are.\\" Despite the initial mishap, Sans found himself warming up to this unexpected detour. All the adult animals were enthralled by the mysterious skeleton who cracked jokes that seemed centuries ahead of his time and miraculously never seemed to get cold despite the snow. For the young ones, Sans brought out some magic tricks – simple illusions and goofy puns – that quickly made him the life of the holiday party. As the starry night drew close, fireworks began to light up the sky in anticipation of the coming new millennium. Sans stood amidst his new friends, a collection of Zootopia's past, present, and future, all laughing and enjoying a moment out of time. Eventually, realizing he couldn't stay forever (and honestly a little homesick for his brother's terrible spaghetti), Sans bid his new friends farewell. He found the Dimension Express patiently waiting, its engine gently humming. \\"Time to hit the bone, I guess,\\" he muttered to himself, climbing aboard. The train conductor tipped his hat once more, a knowing twinkle in his eye. “Did you enjoy the detour, Mr. Sans?” Sans grinned, leaning back against his seat. \\"yeah, it was a real blast from the past. but next time, let's make sure we're on the same page, or, uh, same year.\\" The train chuckled along with a whistle, as it glided back through the snowy swirls of time and space, leaving the twinkling lights of Zootopia behind, and hurtling towards the snowy tranquility of Snowdin. When Sans strolled back home, Papyrus was none the wiser. \\"YOU'RE LATE FOR DINNER, SANS! THE SPAGHETTI IS NOW COLD!\\" Sans just winked at the reader. \\"heh, wouldn't have it any other way, bro.\\" And with that, the skeleton walked into the warmth of home and the waiting, albeit overcooked, pasta."},{"prompt":"START OF PREVIOUS DISCUSSION user:dit moi la valeur du bitcoin en se moment robot:Currently, 1 bitcoin (BTC) is worth approximately 42,601.26 US dollars.

Lilac, touched by Naruto's sincerity and the significance of the Dragon Flower, felt her heart soar with happiness. She had never received such a romantic gesture before and was deeply moved by Naruto's thoughtfulness. In that moment, a newfound bond formed between them, transcending friendship and blossoming into something more profound. The dragons of Avalice, known for their affinity for romance and devotion, admired Naruto's gesture. They celebrated this union between a human and a dragon, recognizing the beauty in the merging of two different worlds and the power of love that transcends boundaries. Naruto's act of giving Lilac the Dragon Flower became a legendary tale, spreading hope and inspiring other dragons and humans to embrace their shared connections. As Naruto and Lilac's relationship deepened, their love essentially became a symbol of unity and acceptance in the merged world. Their affection for one another inspired others to look beyond superficial differences and discover the beauty in building connections and understanding between diverse cultures and species. With Naruto and Lilac at the forefront of this newfound unity, they worked tirelessly to bridge any gaps that existed between the humans and Avalicians. Through their actions, they demonstrated that love, empathy, and understanding could dissolve barriers and foster a world where coexistence was not just possible but embraced. And so, in this merged world where Naruto and the characters of Freedom Planet lived side by side, Naruto's romantic gesture of gifting Lilac the Dragon Flower became an enduring symbol of love and unity. Their relationship and the bond they shared became an inspiration for the entire world, encouraging empathy, understanding, and the celebration of the beauty in diversity."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

I believe by adjusting a few elements in the loading mechanism, we can significantly decrease the time it takes for our main guns to reload.\\" New Jersey: \\"That does sound promising. But how do you plan on achieving that?\\" Akashi: \\"Well, I've noticed that some of the components in the loading mechanism are outdated. By replacing them with more advanced materials and adjusting the design, we can reduce friction and increase efficiency.\\" New Jersey: \\"Interesting. Have you tested this modification on any other ships?\\" Akashi: \\"Not yet, but I have run simulations, and they indicate a noticeable improvement.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"**Title:** \\"Homecomings and Mischances\\" **INT. FAMILY HOME, FOYER - DAY** A quaint, middle-class home with broad strokes of Lebanese cultural heritage adorning the walls and shelves. Framed family photos, ornate artifacts, and a pervasive warmth suggest that this is a home where loud laughs and boisterous voices are not unwelcome. A hallway extends into the depths of the house, promising more of the same warmth and character. **FADE IN:** A jalabiya-clad MOUNA (50s) is tinkering in the kitchen when a frantic KNOCKING on the door echoes through the foyer. The camera FOLLOWs her as she ambles through the hallway, a cloud of confusion on her face. **CUT TO:** EXT. FAMILY HOME, FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS NERINE (19), a Lebanese American college sophomore, tightly curls into herself, hopping from foot to foot. She has a bookish demeanor and wears a concerned expression. Dressed in gym shorts and a college sweatshirt, her dark hair is pulled back into a ponytail – practicality overrides pomp. **NERINE:** (murmuring under her breath) Where the hell is that key? **AT THE DOOR, POV OF NERINE** Desperation marks every forceful rap against the door. **MOUNA (O.S.)** (through the door) Shu? What's all this knocking? Who is it? **NERINE:** (frantic) Ma, It's me! Open up, hurry! **AN ETERNITY SEEMS TO PASS** The locks CLICK and TURN in slow-motion. NERINE’s bouncing becomes more pronounced as the deadbolt unlatches. **MOUNA:** Ya allah, ya bent, what's the rush? I’m coming! MOUNA cracks the door to peer out. Upon seeing her daughter, she opens it fully. Her demeanor softens momentarily, but she is clearly puzzled by NERINE's fidgety urgency. **NERINE:** (pleading) Ma! Move! I need to get through— Before she can dart inside, MOUNA instinctually reaches for her, grasping her arm. **MOUNA:** (concerned) Habbiti, shu fi? What’s wrong? NERINE struggles in MOUNA’s grip, her face grimacing with the effort not to disclose her predicament. **NERINE:** (desperate) Ma, please, just... Let me go. I need to get in. Their bickering RISES, a traditionally Lebanese heated exchange where everyone talks but no one listens. All the while, NERINE dances in place, a look of impending doom on her face. **CUT TO:** NERINE’s urgency TRANSITIONS into a silent battle against her own body, her concentration absolute. A low GROAN, and her expression transforms to one of reluctant relief. **MOUNA:** (bewildered) Yaba! What is it, my girl? NERINE gently disentangles from MOUNA, stepping back to afford herself some privacy – an awkward, stiff-legged stance sets in. **CUT TO:** MOUNA’s eyes widen. Her motherly intuition morphs into confusion as the situation unfolds. **MOUNA:** (puzzled) Ya habbity, if there’s something— **CLOSE ON:** NERINE’s face: brows furrowing with exertion; parse relief-filled grunts. **MOUNA:** (sniffing the air) Eh... what is this smell? **NERINE’s EYES** Widen in horror as reality dawns on her mother. She's still pushing gently, mouthing a silent \\"Oh no.\\" **MOUNA:** (incredulous and disgusted) Aiwa... did you just— Silence. Then: **MOUNA:** (pressing, as realization hits) NERINE! Did you... did you... NERINE’s silence is deafening. A mere nod, a sheepish gaze. \\"Let me just go inside, ma,\\" she mumbles. **MOUNA:** (utterly flabbergasted) Ya Allah... **CLOSE ON MOUNA as she steps aside, gesturing dramatically for NERINE to enter.** NERINE waddles past her mother, cupping the back of her soiled shorts. **MOUNA:** (to NERINE's retreating back, half-scolding, half-amused) La hawla wala quwwata... Don't you dare drop anything on my floor. NERINE's face twitches with a blend of shame and piqued dignity. **NERINE:** (sulkily) If you hadn’t taken a century to open the— **MOUNA:** (interrupting) A century ha? No excuse! You’re a college girl, not a baby! NERINE, her back to MOUNA, is touching the bulge in her shorts with a dual expression of disgust and resignation. **NERINE:** (defensive) It’s your fault, Ma. I just... I had to go so bad. I couldn't help it once it started. **MOUNA:** (exasperated) Help it? You let it happen! Filling your pants like a— MOUNA turns NERINE around for inspection, both of them bickering over the absurdity of the situation. **MOUNA:** (teasingly fierce) Oh, what do we have here? A grown girl enjoying her— NERINE covers her face with one hand, the other still on her backside. **NERINE:** (playfully defiant) It was lots, Ma, I couldn't stop it. The relief... I needed it, okay? **MOUNA:** (mock sternness) So nasty. If you’re going to act like a baby, you'll be treated as one. MOUNA sniff-checks the situation, scrunching her nose at the odor while imparting mock disgust. **NERINE:** (cringing) Yeah, I know, very smelly... If you won't let me clean, we can stand here and \\"enjoy\\" it together, huh? MOUNA scoffs, gently propelling NERINE toward the bathroom, still complaining of the stench. **MOUNA:** (adamant) Yalla, bas enough! No leakage on my tiles, you hear? **CUT TO:** **BATHROOM DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER** NERINE hobbles to the threshold, playing a coy card. **NERINE:** Maybe you want to change me now, Ma? You seem to— Without missing a beat, MOUNA nudges NERINE into the bathroom, pressing on the soiled bulge for emphasis, her face one of amused challenge. **MOUNA:** (agitated but also playful) Get in and clean your dirty behind right now! NERINE clutches at the bulge, aghast, as she crosses into the bathroom. **NERINE:** (shocked) Ma, it’s spreading! MOUNA, still holding her nose, shuts the bathroom door firmly. **MOUNA:** (resigned satisfaction) You deserved that, Yaba. MOUNA walks away, muttering to herself about the trials of parenthood. **FADE OUT.**"},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base...) New Jersey: \\"Phew! Finally, a day where I can relax.

Naruto, notorious for his competitive spirit, would challenge Lilac to a fight, wanting to test his skills against a worthy opponent. Initially, Lilac might underestimate Naruto, considering him to be just a mere human. But as the battle progresses, she quickly realizes that Naruto is a force to be reckoned with. Using his chakra-infused attacks, summoning techniques, and the agility he gained from his ninja training, Naruto would prove to be a formidable opponent for Lilac. He would utilize his shadow clones to confuse and outmaneuver her, while also incorporating his powerful Rasengan technique. Despite Lilac's speed and maneuverability, Naruto's cunning and battle experience would eventually grant him the upper hand. With a final blow, Naruto emerges as the victor of their encounter. However, rather than reveling in his triumph, Naruto would extend his hand to Lilac, acknowledging her strength and offering his respect. Curious about Lilac's world and wanting to learn from her unique abilities, Naruto would strike up a conversation with her. He would express his admiration for her powers and inquire about her experiences as a dragon-like being. Naruto's curiosity and genuine interest in Lilac's life would pave the way for a deep friendship to blossom between the two. They would exchange stories, share knowledge, and perhaps Naruto would even introduce Lilac to his friends from the Hidden Leaf Village. Together, they would embark on adventures, facing new challenges and enemies, while weaving the world of ninja and dragon-like creatures into an even more fascinating narrative. In this AU, Naruto's encounter with Lilac would not only expand his understanding of the world but also allow him to forge connections beyond his own universe. Their friendship would showcase the power of unity, as they join forces to protect both their worlds from any imminent threats, proving that even in the most unlikely pairings, incredible alliances can be formed."},{"prompt":"Write a fully detailed story about a man entering a lucid dream at will, and a spaceship landing on his lawn. He enters it, and finds a pilot inside with a helmet covering their face. He asks who they are, and the pilot reveals them self to be a woman.","completion":"Title: The Lucid Voyager The blue hue of twilight bled into the remnants of the day as Edgar Wallace reclined in the antique armchair positioned meticulously at the center of his meticulously kept study. With the last wisps of daylight dying on the horizon, he had prepped himself for an experience that had become as regular to him as the sun's daily disappearance: entering a lucid dream. Unlike most who stumbled into such a state unwittingly, Edgar had honed his skill through years of practice, seamlessly drifting from one reality to another with the intention and ease of flipping a switch. As he closed his eyes, the familiar sense of detachment washed over him. Sounds from the physical world dimmed as if someone had dialed down life's volume, allowing the symphony of his inner dreamscape to crescendo. Surreality embraced him as Edgar crossed the border into his dreaming mind. The verdant lawn of his subconscious unfurled before him; his study now replaced with the wide expanse of his personal dream-world, where the grass whisked his fingertips with every step he took. It was a paradise crafted from the vestiges of his memories and deepest desires, familiar yet ever-changing, ready to respond to his lucid commands. But tonight was different. Without a signal from his dreaming will, a disturbance rippled through the tranquil scene. The air bristled with an electric charge, and Edgar turned his gaze skyward where a speck had appeared—a shape growing larger, rapidly descending from the cosmic fabric of his conjured night sky. His heart raced, not with fear but with anticipation. This was no creation of his own design but something spontaneous that bore the hallmark of raw, unscripted adventure. The object, a spaceship with an aerodynamic silhouette and a hull glowing with otherworldly energy, descended with a grace that defied its apparent mass. It came to rest upon his lawn, and the grass beneath it barely bent under its touch, as though the vessel was simultaneously there and not there. The ship was sleek, iridescent, and when the hatch opened, a staircase descended toward the ground like a tongue unfurling to taste the terrestrial landscape. Edgar stepped forward, driven by an insatiable curiosity that outweighed any residual hesitation. Tactile feedback against his feet reminded him he was indeed in a dream, though every sensation suggested otherwise. At the foot of the stairs, he looked back at his house—or where his house would be—then climbed into the unknown. Inside the ship, the technology was both alien and yet unmistakable in purpose: consoles adorned with glyphs pulsing with light, panels of encased stardust, controls molded for a pilot of human-like form. At the center stood the pilot, still and awaiting his approach, cloaked in a uniform that was as much armor as it was attire and wearing a helmet that obscured their identity. \\"Who are you?\\" Edgar's voice echoed through the confines of the vessel, bravado tinged with wonder. At his inquiry, the helmet began to hiss and click as the visor lifted. Beneath it, a woman's face revealed itself, framed with auburn hair that seemed to have captured twilight within its strands. Her eyes, as deep and dark as the space from which she descended, held the stars themselves, and her lips parted to smile at the dreamer before her. \\"My name,\\" she spoke, her voice a harmonious blend of familiarity and enigma, \\"is Isla. I am the pilot of this vessel and the custodian of the dreams you've yet to dream.\\" Edgar's breath hitched in his throat, a million questions racing through his mind. But the dream's lucidity held, and he understood there were no coincidences here. \\"Are you real or a figment of my imagination?\\" he asked, trying to ground himself in the logic that was increasingly elusive. Isla laughed softly, a sound that mingled with the ambient hum of the ship. \\"Here in your dream, I am as real as your own consciousness allows me to be. But make no mistake, Edgar Wallace, for sometimes a dream can be a bridge to truths and worlds beyond one's own understanding.\\" Transfixed, Edgar placed a hand against the cool metal of the console, half believing he would wake at any moment. Isla motioned to a chair beside her. \\"Come, sit. I'll show you the expanse of what you can reach when you dream with intent.\\" Edgar approached, joined her at the helm, and as she guided the controls with a dancer's grace, they spoke of the manifold layers of reality, of the power of the human mind, and the untold depths of the dreamscape. As the ship lifted, freed from any physical tether, they soared through galaxies of improbable beauty and realms unconstrained by linear time. Within his lucid dream, Edgar Wallace traveled further than ever before, accompanied by the mysterious woman, Isla, who piloted not just the ship but guided him through the corridors of his own vast potential. When morning light crept into the cracks of his eyelids, Edgar awoke not to memories of spacefaring but with an invigorating sense of wonder, and the lingering feeling that somewhere beyond, Isla and her spaceship were indeed waiting for his consciousness to soar once more."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

We must be cautious with our resources. Akashi, can you provide any additional proof or information about this tech part? Akashi: Nyahaha! Unfortunately, this tech part is so rare that there are no blueprints or extensive documentation available. But trust me, many shipgirls who have purchased it are singing praises! Bismarck: I find it hard to believe without concrete evidence. New Jersey, I don't want to take unnecessary risks with our resources. We should exercise caution and maybe gather more information before making any decisions. New Jersey: I agree with Bismarck. Akashi, is there any way we can test this tech part before committing to the purchase? It would certainly ease our concerns. Akashi: Nyahaha! That's a splendid idea, New Jersey! I have prepared a small batch of the tech parts for testing purposes. You can try them out and see the improvements for yourself! Bismarck: Well, that does sound reasonable. If the tests prove successful, it might be worth considering. But I insist on thorough testing, New Jersey. We cannot afford any compromises when it comes to our combat capabilities. New Jersey: Absolutely, Bismarck. We'll conduct rigorous testing and gather feedback from other shipgirls before making any decisions. Akashi, are you okay with this arrangement? Akashi: Nyahaha! Of course, New Jersey! Akashi is confident in her tech, and I'm sure it'll pass with flying colors! Just remember, time is of the essence, so don't take too long! (New Jersey and Bismarck leave Akashi's shop, ready to begin the testing process and gather feedback from the shipgirls. They remain cautious but hopeful that this rare tech part could indeed enhance their combat capabilities.)"},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) New Jersey: “Phew!

Akashi: (Grinning mischievously) Ohoho~ Bismarck-chan here needs some assistance with a little problem she ran into, nya! New Jersey: (Sighs) Akashi, what have you done this time? Bismarck: It's not entirely Akashi's fault. You see, I borrowed some equipment from her shop for a mission, and it seems I've misplaced it. I've searched everywhere, but I can't find it. New Jersey: (Raises an eyebrow) Borrowed? Bismarck, I hope you remember that \\"borrowing\\" without permission is considered stealing. Bismarck: I-I know that, but I had good intentions! It was for the sake of the mission, I assure you. Akashi: (Giggles) Bismarck-chan is very responsible, nya. Don't worry, she wouldn't steal anything.

New Jersey: (Smirking) Bismarck, I think I may have found what you're looking for. (Bismarck rushes over and opens the box to find the missing equipment.) Bismarck: (Relieved) Oh, thank goodness! I can't believe I overlooked it. Thank you, New Jersey. I owe you one. New Jersey: (Chuckling) Just remember to be more careful in the future, especially when it comes to borrowing things.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"Title: \\"Urgent Matters\\" INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS BATHROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) Before we witness the frantic arrival back home, we see NAWAL, a defiant Palestinian American college senior, avoiding the public bathroom. She’s in her early 20s, with a vibrant headscarf and wearing comfortable, baggy cargo pants - a direct choice to circumvent restrictive clothing like jeans. Her aversion to using bathrooms outside her home’s privacy is palpable as she grimaces at the stalls, ultimately choosing to hold it until she can return to her sanctuary. INT. NAWAL'S FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY NAWAL sprints toward her family's modest front door, clutching her stomach with a pained expression. She rummages through her bag, her movements becoming more frantic when she realizes her key is not where it should be. NAWAL (panting) Oh, come on! With panic setting in, she pounds on the door with urgency. A beat passes—no answer. Nawal's discomfort is mounting, her body tensing with each knock. INT. NAWAL'S FAMILY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Through the door, we hear the muffled voice of SABRINA, Nawal's mom, a middle-aged woman with a stern yet loving demeanor, dressed in a simple, modest dress. SABRINA (through the door) What in the world is going on out there? Nawal knocks harder, dancing from foot to foot. NAWAL (breathless) Mama, please! Hurry! INT. NAWAL'S FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Sabrina fumbles with the chain and deadbolt, her pace agonizingly slow for Nawal. NAWAL (pleading) Mama, please! Finally, the door swings open. Nawal tries to dart inside, but Sabrina, puzzled by Nawal's urgency, instinctively grabs her to assess the situation. SABRINA (alarmed) Nawal! What's wrong? Talk to me! NAWAL (fighting) Let me in! I just need to... Please move! Entangled, they bicker. Sabrina inadvertently blocks Nawal from her dire goal—the bathroom. NAWAL (desperate) Mama, I really need to— Nawal grimaces. The pressure is unbearable. She loses control, her face contorts in shock, followed by untimely relief. Sabrina's grip slackens, her concern peaking. SABRINA (confused) Habibti? What's—? Nawal gently breaks free, standing awkwardly to accommodate her new discomfort. NAWAL (faintly, relieved) Oh no... SABRINA (staring, concerned) Nawal? Nawal stands with her back to her mom, subtly shifting her weight, the occasional grunt betraying her predicament. Sabrina sniffs; her confusion turns to suspicion as a foul smell wafts. Nawal sighs deeply, her body language admitting to her current state. SABRINA (scrunching her nose) What is that smell? Nawal faces her mom, sieved with embarrassment. SABRINA (shocked) Did you...? No! Nawal remains silent, her eyes pleading. SABRINA (disgustedly) You pooped your pants? Nawal, deflecting: NAWAL (awkwardly) Can I just go inside now? Sabrina steps aside, grimacing, waving her in impatiently. NAWAL (mortified) Excuse me... Nawal waddles past, cupping the seat of her pants. Sabrina stops her a few steps in. SABRINA (estranged) If any drops—Hey! That's not—Why would you? NAWAL (defensively) This is your fault, you know? SABRINA (sarcastically) Yes, because not using the bathroom at school is my doing! NAWAL It just happened! The urge was too much! SABRINA (inspecting the damage) And you decided to just go here? NAWAL (stifling embarrassment with humor) I had to let it out, Sabrina, scolding: SABRINA (incredulously) And you think this is okay?! NAWAL (playing the victim) You're the one who stopped me! Sabrina inspects the situation closer, turning Nawal around, taunts: SABRINA (taunting) Feeling good, are we? NAWAL (touching the bulge) It had to come out, Mama...

At the bathroom threshold, Nawal pauses, teasingly: NAWAL (cheeky) Want to change my— Sabrina, reaching her limit, shoves Nawal inside, making a point by squashing the unpleasant lump. SABRINA (pushing her) Get in there, you stinker! NAWAL (disgusted but amused) Mama! The door slams shut. Alone, Sabrina exhales, defeated and amused at her absurd circumstances. SABRINA (to herself) How did I raise such a smelly kid? FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"In a LD, is it possible to create an entire sci fi adventure complete with spaceships and energy swords?","completion":"I assume by \\"LD\\" you mean lucid dreaming. In a lucid dream, the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming and can often exert some level of control over the dream's content, the environment, and their actions within the dream. Yes, it is possible to create an entire sci-fi adventure complete with spaceships and energy swords in a lucid dream. The imagination and the subconscious mind power the dream world, providing virtually limitless potential for the scenarios one can experience. Well-practiced lucid dreamers often learn to manipulate their dream environments to create elaborate settings, characters, and narratives. Lucid dreaming requires a certain skill level to influence and maintain control over the dream content. Beginners might find it challenging to create detailed and complex narratives right away, as they're still learning how to stabilize the dream and control their actions. However, with experience and practice, many lucid dreamers report being able to craft intricate worlds and exciting adventures, much like a personal virtual reality or a narrative from a book or movie. That being said, the dreamer’s ability to conjure up such detailed scenes in a lucid dream will depend on various factors, including their level of lucidity, dream control, previous experience with lucid dreaming, and their familiarity with the sci-fi genre elements they wish to create. Some people might find it easier than others to visualize and maintain complex scenarios in dreams. For those looking to enhance their ability to control their dreams, techniques such as reality checks, dream journaling, and various induction methods can help improve lucidity and dream manipulation skills over time."},{"prompt":"Is it possible to have a LD if you simply expect you’ll have one?","completion":"Having a lucid dream simply through expectation is possible but not guaranteed. The phenomenon is known as dream incubation, where a person's intention or expectation to realize they are dreaming can sometimes result in a lucid dream. This technique involves focusing on the intention to become aware that you're dreaming before falling asleep. The success of this technique, like many aspects of lucid dreaming, can vary greatly from person to person. Some individuals might find that strong intent and belief alone can spontaneously trigger lucidity, especially if they have a history of lucid dreaming or a naturally higher propensity for it. For others, intention might need to be coupled with more targeted techniques for inducing lucidity. Here are common approaches that may work in tandem with expectation to increase the chances of having a lucid dream: 1. Reality checks: Performing reality checks throughout the day can increase the likelihood of doing them in your dream, potentially triggering lucidity. 2. MILD (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams): This technique involves setting a strong intention to remember to recognize you're dreaming as you fall asleep. It often entails repeating a mantra to oneself. 3. WBTB (Wake Back to Bed): Waking up after a few hours of sleep and then going back to bed can increase the chances of entering a REM sleep phase (where dreams are most vivid) with a higher level of consciousness. 4. Dream journaling: Keeping a dream journal can help with recognizing dream patterns and becoming more aware of your dream state. 5. Visualization: Before falling asleep, visualize yourself becoming lucid in a dream. This can overlap with the MILD technique if you're also repeating an intention-based mantra. 6. WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dreams): This advanced technique involves maintaining consciousness while your body falls asleep, typically leading directly into a lucid dream. Expectation can be a powerful tool, but it usually becomes more effective when used in conjunction with these methods, consistent practice, and a bit of patience. Every individual's experience with lucid dreaming is unique, so what works for one person might not work for another. Experimentation and practice are often necessary to find the best approach for inducing lucid dreams."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) New Jersey: “Phew! Finally, a day where I can relax.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"FADE IN: INT.

Laila's face is awash with bashful defiance. MUNA (CONT'D) (poignantly mocking) Why are you so dirty, huh? LAILA looks down in silent mortification, sniffing resentfully at the tainted air. MUNA inspects her, shaking her head in mock disappointment. MUNA (CONT'D) (exasperatedly) Will you ever grow up? LAILA, her pride surfacing as a smirk, places the blame squarely on MUNA, though her stance betrays her discomfort. LAILA (rebelliously) You blocked me, Mom! MUNA scoffs at the attempt to shift blame, an eyebrow raised in wry amusement. MUNA (irreverently) And you just stood there and went? LAILA, her protests waning into a self-deprecating concession, gingerly assesses the damage. LAILA (reluctantly) I really had to go... MUNA mercilessly continues the barrage of shame, her voice playful yet firm, each word a verbal nudge. MUNA (half-mocking) Well, aren't you a mess? LAILA, cheeks flaming, defends her actions far more playfully than before, an air of satisfaction mingling with her discomfort. LAILA (smirking) It felt good... I should... clean up. MUNA halts LAILA's waddle, her tone layered with sarcasm and genuine concern. MUNA (skeptical chide) Good? Really? Let's see this \\"good.\\" Flipping LAILA around, MUNA's wide eyes dance over the bulge, her jibes holding hints of teasing affection. MUNA (CONT'D) Amazed at the pride in your dirty work! LAILA shyly rebuts, even as her hand compulsively smooths over her fabric prison, her defense as much for herself as for MUNA. LAILA (embarrassed retort) Just... a lot of pressure, okay? MUNA chuckles, though her nose scrunches as she leans in, sniffing with exaggerated distaste. MUNA (playfully scornful) A child, you are. LAILA, cringing, inadvertently admits to her current, smelly plight, her retort losing its edge as it mixes with the potent aroma. LAILA (wryly) Since I'm here, might as well enjoy the smell. MUNA waves her hand dismissively, ushering LAILA forward while holding a hand over her nose, her every movement an effort to steer clear of any potential fallout. MUNA (through a grimace) Just go clean yourself! INT. HOME HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Escorted by an olfactory escort of groans and protestations, LAILA waddles as MUNA helps with one hand plugged on her nose and the other ensuring containment. MUNA (nudging her) Watch that... stuff. LAILA (bashfully) I'm trying! INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER LAILA halts on the threshold, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes, grasping the bulge in her trousers. LAILA (teasingly) Maybe you want to change me? MUNA, affronted yet amused, answers with a playful shove, pressing the incriminated bulk, her fingers purposefully mushing the mess. MUNA (shoving LAILA) Get in there, miss stinky pants! LAILA (disgusted shriek) It's all smushed now! Laughing as she closes the door on the humiliated LAILA, MUNA mumbles to herself. MUNA (aloud to herself) What a daughter I have...

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"**INT.

Fatima is incredulous, dismisses this as no excuse. Layla inspects the bulge; it's playful self-pity. LAYLA (resigned yet complacent) Felt good to let go, but cleanup time. Fatima blocks Layla, scolding her for feeling relieved. FATIMA (mimicking disgust) Let me see this \\"enjoyable deed.\\" After brief resistance, Fatima examines Layla's soiled rear, taunting her.

Este é o tempo necessário para que uma variável de processo, como a saída de um sistema de controle, se estabilize dentro de uma faixa aceitável em torno do valor desejado após uma alteração ou perturbação. Em outras palavras, após aplicar um controle ou ter uma mudança em uma condição de entrada, o sistema pode oscilar ou responder antes de atingir uma condição estável. O tempo de acomodação é a quantidade de tempo que o sistema leva para cessar essas oscilações e permanecer próximo ao valor de referência, tipicamente dentro de uma pequena percentagem do valor final desejado. Este conceito é importante para o desenho e a análise de sistemas de controle, pois indica quão rapidamente um sistema pode se recuperar de mudanças e voltar ao funcionamento normal. Em aplicações industriais, um tempo de acomodação mais curto é geralmente preferível, pois significa uma resposta mais rápida a perturbações e, portanto, um controle mais eficiente do processo. No entanto, sistemas que se acomodam muito rapidamente também podem se tornar instáveis ou exibir comportamento oscilatório excessivo, o que também não é desejável. Se o Control Station for um software específico que você está usando, é possível que tenha ferramentas para medir o tempo de acomodação como parte do desenho e análise de sistemas de controle. É comum que tais softwares de controle de processo forneçam métricas como overshoot, tempo de subida, tempo de acomodação, e erro constante para ajudar engenheiros a otimizar desempenhos de laços de controle. Se você está trabalhando com um sistema real ou em um contexto específico do programa Control Station, seria aconselhável consultar a documentação técnica ou suporte técnico do software para obter a definição precisa e como ela é aplicada dentro do programa. Se precisar de mais detalhes contextuais para sua situação específica, por favor, forneça mais informações para que eu possa ajudá-lo melhor."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The spells can have various effects, such as dealing damage, applying status effects, or altering the battlefield. Here are some spell ideas for each elemental combination: # Fire Combinations - **Blaze (Fire + Wind):** Cyclone Blaze - Summon a fiery tornado that deals damage and has a chance to disorient enemies it hits, reducing their accuracy for the next turn. - **Lava (Fire + Earth):** Magma Surge - Create a wave of molten rock that damages and potentially \\"burns\\" the ground, causing damage over time to those who step on it. - **Steam (Fire + Water):** Boiling Mist - Envelop an area in a scalding fog that damages over time and provides concealment, reducing enemy hit chance within it. - **Explosion (Fire + Lightning):** Chain Detonation - Trigger a series of explosive blasts that deals heavy damage to a single target and splash damage to adjacent enemies. - **Inferno (Fire + Darkness):** Shadowflame Eruption - Unleash flames shrouded in darkness that engulf enemies, dealing damage and afflicting them with Fear, making them more likely to flee or miss their actions. # Wind Combinations - **Dust (Wind + Earth):** Sandstorm Barrage - Call upon a sandstorm that reduces visibility and damages all enemies in a large area over several turns. - **Ice (Wind + Water):** Frost Gale - Summon a chilling wind that slows enemies and has a chance to freeze them on the spot for a turn. - **Storm (Wind + Lightning):** Thunder Cyclone - A massive storm that periodically strikes random enemies within an area with lightning. - **Void (Wind + Darkness):** Abyssal Vortex - Create a suction force that pulls enemies toward a center point, possibly disorienting them or causing minor damage. - **Aether (Wind + Light):** Luminous Breeze - A soothing wind that heals allies and clears negative status effects. # Earth Combinations - **Plant (Earth + Water):** Overgrowth - Accelerate plant growth in an area to entangle and immobilize enemies, potentially sapping their health slowly as they struggle. - **Metal (Earth + Lightning):** Ferric Tempest - Metallic shards are electrified and hurled at enemy targets, reducing their armor effectiveness and dealing ongoing electric damage. - **Gravity (Earth + Darkness):** Graviton Crush - Increase the gravitational pull in an area, slowing enemies and making it harder for them to move or dodge attacks. # Other Combinations - **Poison (Water + Darkness):** Toxic Deluge - Inflict a poisonous downpour over enemies, dealing damage for several turns and reducing their healing received. - **Plasma (Lightning + Light):** Radiant Discharge - Emit a burst of plasma energy that deals high damage and ignores a portion of the target's defenses. - **Twilight (Darkness + Light):** Umbra-Lumen Rift - Alternate between darkness and light to confuse enemies, dealing damage and either blinding them or shrouding your units in protective shadow.

Спустя несколько часов, дикая кошка все еще ищет Эвелин в лесу. Она напряженно разглядывает окружающие пространства, но не может обнаружить скрытую девушку. Уставшая и разочарованная, кошка решает вернуться в свое укрытие и продолжить поиски позже. Пока дикая кошка отсутствует, Эвелин выбирается из пещеры и быстро бежит обратно в свой дом. Она знает, что теперь ее безопасность первостепенная задача и что она должна найти Шерлока, чтобы быть с ним в безопасности. Эвелин ищет Шерлока по всему дому и саду, но его нет нигде. Она понимает, что Шерлок, вероятно, ищет ее и пытается помочь. Эвелин решает отправиться обратно в лес, чтобы встретиться с Шерлоком и объединить свои с"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"INT. FAMILY HOME ENTRYWAY - DAY We find ourselves in the quiet, sunlit entryway of a modest two-story home. Framed family photos adorn the walls, hinting at the love and chaos that fill the home. Our scene begins outside the front door. EXT. FAMILY HOME FRONT DOOR - DAY We are introduced to LAYLA HASSAN, 22, a Palestinian American college senior with shoulder-length curly hair, deep brown eyes gleaming with intelligence and sharp wit. Her style is practical: she dons comfy jogging pants and a loose-fitting tee layered with a cardigan, perfect for a busy yet defiant woman who values comfort over convention. A determined microexpression plays at the corners of her mouth, betraying an internal struggle with each hurried step closer to home. Layla's pace is quick, uneven, urgency in her posture. As she arrives at the front door, she frantically rummages through her bag. A lanyard with the missing key dangles mockingly from her thoughts but not from her grip. EXT. FAMILY HOME FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Layla knocks desperately. No key, no time, no hope. LAYLA (calling out) Mom! Anyone! Please, open up! INT. FAMILY HOME ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The door remains closed. We hear the shuffle of feet from within the house. INT. FAMILY HOME LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS The sound of a TV show plays faintly in the background. MARIAM HASSAN, 48, a woman with lines of wisdom etched into her expressive face, pauses cleaning. Her attire is casual, a comfortable long-sleeve shirt and pants, her hair in a simple updo. Mariam's warm, inquisitive eyes find the door with concern. MARIAM (bemused) Layla, is that you hammering the door down? EXT. FAMILY HOME FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Layla is in visible discomfort, motioning to her abdomen inconspicuously. LAYLA (as casual as possible) Yes, Mom, it's me! Can you please hurry? INT. FAMILY HOME ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Mariam starts to unlatch the door. Each tick of the deadbolt sounds agonizingly long to Layla on the other side. LAYLA (O.S.) I mean it, Mom, please! Mariam opens the door to reveal Layla's flushed face. MARIAM (concerned) Habibti, what's the rush— Layla surges forward, but Mariam, still holding the door, becomes an accidental barricade. LAYLA (voice strained) Move, Mom, I really— Mariam grips Layla's shoulders, her maternal instinct sensing distress. MARIAM (holding Layla) Tell me what's wrong, Layla! Their embodied struggle cements them at the doorway. Mariam's firm grip — Layla's agitated efforts to wriggle free. A familial tug-of-war. LAYLA (pleading) Nothing's wrong, just let me in! As the tension escalates, we observe the microexpressions of terror and determination battling across Layla's face. Her posture strains. Suddenly, Layla's eyes widen. Her body tenses and then visibly sags; relief and despair mix on her face as the unspeakable happens. It's done. MARIAM (releasing her grasp) What—what happened, Layla? Silent, Layla edges back subtly, adopting a stance that, regrettably, facilitates her condition. She continues, eyes half-closed, a soft grunt of relief escaping her lips. MARIAM (eyes narrowing) Are you okay, Layla? LAYLA (breathless, mutters) It's... it's fine now... A lingering pause as Mariam observes Layla, now absorbed in her peculiar relief. Confusion mixes with dawning horror. Sniffing the air tentatively, Mariam meets the ill-timed epiphany head-on; distaste colors her features. MARIAM (disgust laced with revelation) Did you just... did you...? LAYLA (embarassed, redirected) Let me in. I need to... clean up. Mariam's face scrunches in disbelief but she steps aside, motioning with exaggeration for Layla to pass. Layla, cupping her own circumstance, waddles past. Mariam halts Layla a few steps in, her voice tight with reproach. MARIAM (scolding) Don't you dare drop any of that on my floor! LAYLA (trying to save face) I wouldn't have if you didn't— MARIAM (cutting her off, teasingly) Blame me? Really? Layla, my god, the whole movement? You're twenty-two! LAYLA (sulkily, defiantly) An overbearing urge doesn't check age, Mom! She assesses the damage to her clothes, grimaces playfully yet squirms with discomfort. LAYLA Despite your blockade, I admit... (sighing) ...it did feel... relieving. Mariam blocks her, mockingly stern now. MARIAM (scoffing) Nasty! You're enjoying this dirty deed? Visibly struggling, she forces Layla to turn, her gaze meeting the tangible evidence. MARIAM (teasing) So, this nastiness fills you with joy? LAYLA (timorous retort) It's not joy—it was necessity—and it's a lot. Layla touches the bulge for emphasis. MARIAM (exclaiming) That's nasty, Layla! Children do that happily! She infantilizes the inspection, sniffing near the soiled fabric, her face a contorted mask of mock curiosity and playfulness. LAYLA (reacting to herself) This smelly thing... Since you're stalling me, let's enjoy it together. Mariam dismisses the jibe with a scoff. MARIAM (urging) You are leaving—your smell is too much. Guiding Layla with her hands, Mariam's mandating bath-time, yet trying to keep her distance from the ordeal. MARIAM (to the waddling Layla) Don't you dare spill a drop on my floor! LAYLA Do you see me? Some is ready to slide out! MARIAM (renewing the comical bid) Keep it in! This stench! Yallah, to the bathroom! Upon reaching the threshold, Layla teases with a rebellious twinkle. LAYLA (pinching her nose, plaintive) Wanna change my diaper, Mom? Mariam, affronted yet amused, indulges Layla's audacity, pressing the mess into a squash as she guides her in. MARIAM (squeamish, pressing urgently) Get in there already, you dirty girl! The indignant cry from Layla marks her entry, a victorious march by Mariam, face still contorted. LAYLA (protesting) Ugh, it's spreading! MARIAM (retorting as she closes the door) Serves you right! Yallah, go clean up! Mariam walks away, still pressing her nose, shaking her head in mock despair. The door muffles Layla's resigned cleanup efforts. MARIAM (talking to herself) A daughter who can outstink warak enab? Fading laughter follows Mariam's disjointed recollections of stuffed vine leaves and their sharper aromas, a whisper of joy amidst the smelly turmoil.

О"},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Lebanese American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a timid college sophomore; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"# EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON A quiet suburban neighborhood basks in the golden light of the late afternoon. Children's laughter echoes from a distant backyard and a dog barks happily. # INT.

The room is tastefully decorated with a mix of Middle Eastern artifacts and modern American design. # EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER SOPHIA (19), a timid college sophomore of Lebanese descent with shoulder-length brown hair and wearing practical cargo pants and a fitted tee, scurries up to the front door. She clutches her stomach, her face tense with the unmistakable look of gastric distress after a long bus ride from campus, where the only bathroom was out of order. Sophia reaches for her keys, panic dawning on her as she realizes they are not in her purse. A cramp clenches her gut, and she frantically bangs on the door. # INT.

Sophia whispers to herself, oblivious to her mother's bewildered stare. Layla sniffs the air tentatively, her nose wrinkling. LAYLA (suspicious) Haida shoo? (What is this?) Sophia faces her mother, cheeks burning red. LAYLA (putting it together) Sophia! Ma sarret...? (Did you...?) SOPHIA (squirming) Can I just go now, please? Layla steps back, letting Sophia pass with an expression of disgusted bewilderment. # INT.

Layla exclaims about Sophia's disregard for cleanliness, pretending to inspect her like a child. The smell wafts and Layla feigns an exaggerated sniff. SOPHIA (cringing) Yeah, I do smell terrible, I guess. Layla waves away her comment, urging Sophia towards the bathroom with a mix of mockery and urgency. SOPHIA (holding her pants) It feels like it's gonna fall... LAYLA (waving) Just don’t make a bigger mess, dear! They make their way to the bathroom, Layla pointing out the stench. Sophia waddles awkwardly, cringing and holding her pants. SOPHIA (fighting laughter) Should you change my \\"diaper\\"? Layla’s face shifts from humor to feigned indignation. Playfully, she pushes Sophia into the bathroom, squashing the messy bulge with a firm grip. LAYLA (forceful, playful) Into the bathroom, yella! (hurry up!)

How Lilac react to Human (Naruto) | au: What if Naruto and Freedom Planet lived in the sam. part 1","completion":"Lilac, the dragon-tiger hybrid protagonist from the game \\"Freedom Planet,\\" lived in a world where humans had never encountered dragons or Avalicians (an alien race). However, in this alternate universe, Lilac finds herself face-to-face with a human named Naruto from the world of Naruto. At first glance, Lilac would likely be intrigued and curious about this peculiar-looking creature. The vibrant orange jumpsuit and bright blue eyes would catch her attention, as she had never seen anything like it before. Naruto's energetic nature and loud personality would probably make Lilac initially cautious but also intrigued by his apparent fearlessness. As Naruto approaches Lilac, he might have a broad grin on his face and extend his hand for a friendly handshake, eager to make a new friend. Lilac, being a friendly and warm-hearted character, would reciprocate the gesture, albeit cautiously. She would be intrigued by Naruto's body structures, as humans in her world differed greatly from Avalicians and other creatures she knew. As they converse, Lilac would be fascinated by Naruto's stories and experiences. She would find his determination and bravery inspiring, recognizing the similarities between his adventures and the challenges she faces in her own world. Naruto's ninja techniques and physical abilities would astonish her, making her realize that humans also possess unique strengths and skills. Over time, Lilac and Naruto would forge a bond based on their shared desire for justice and their belief in the power of friendship. Despite their differences in appearance and origins, they would learn from each other and grow together, forming a strong friendship built on trust and understanding.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"INT. FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - AFTERNOON BACKDROP: Sophie Karam, a 19-year-old Lebanese American college sophomore, is shuffling determinedly towards her family home in the suburbs. Clad in a pair of loose-fitting, pale blue sweatpants and a college hoodie, her auburn hair is pulled into a disheveled ponytail, her brow damp with perspiration. We catch her clenching and unclenching her midsection, the discomfort evident. The moderately high-consumption of dairy during an on-campus event, combined with her undisclosed lactose intolerance, has become a ticking time bomb. Normally punctual with the whereabouts of her belongings, Sophie's unusual preoccupation with her escalating need has led to the misplacement of her house key. Sophie reaches the front door, her movements erratic due to mounting urgency. Fumbling through her bag yields nothing as the realization hits her - the key is missing. SOPHIE (panicking) Oh, no, no, no. Frantic, she knocks on the heavy wooden door, each rap more desperate than the last. Holding her lower abdomen, she paces in tiny circles, the pressure on her bowels building to critical levels. SOPHIE (muttering) Come on, someone... please... Time grinds to a halt as seconds crawl by without a response. Sophie's distress crescendos, her knocks now thunderous. SOPHIE Mom! Dad! Anyone! VOICE (O.S.) (slightly muffled) Sophie? Is that you? Sophie's head whips towards the door, her eyes wide and pleading. The cogs of the lock finally begin to turn from the inside, agonizingly slow. The door swings open to reveal NAJWA KARAM, a late-40s Lebanese American woman with curly, chestnut hair and kind but expedient eyes. SOPHIE (imploringly) Yes, it's me! Please, move. Confusion, then concern tints Najwa's features as she steps into Sophie's path. NAJWA (softly, grasping Sophie's arm) Habibti, what's wrong? Why the panic? Sophie squirms against Najwa's hold, pleading urgency in her eyes. SOPHIE (anxiously) I just gotta get by, Mama! Please! Their bickering escalates as Sophie's prays for reprieve go unheard. Najwa, sensing a deeper issue, holds firmer out of worry. NAJWA (concern growing) Sophie! Tell me what's going on! Abruptly, Sophie groans, her face contorting in shock and spontaneous relief. The tension in Najwa's grip slackens as she notes the drastic shift in her daughter's demeanor. SOPHIE (breathing heavily) I... I can't... Najwa watches, perplexed, as Sophie shuffles back slightly, awkwardly adjusting her stance to accommodate the disaster unfolding in her pants. Sounds of exertion mix oddly with sighs of release, bluntly narrating the unspoken truth. NAJWA (puzzled) Sophie? Sweetheart? For a moment, there's no coherent response, only the burbling tones of discomfort turning into gratification. NAJWA (alarm rising) Are you okay? What's going— Najwa's eyes widen as she sniffs the air, the odor unmistakable. Sophie stands sheepish, her gaze lowered. NAJWA (reeling) Did you... no, did you just...? Sophie meets her mother's eye, the silence loud between them. Finally, Najwa connects the dots, an expression of horror spreading across her face. NAJWA (disgusted) My God, Sophie... you pooped your pants?! Sophie nods reluctantly, avoiding the entire admission. SOPHIE (desperately) Can you let me in now? As Sophie shuffles inside, Najwa steps back, holding her nose, disgust plain. NAJWA (beckoning, impatient) Ugh, go, go... Only a few steps in, Najwa halts Sophie with a cautionary tone. NAJWA (lecturing) Wait there! Don't you dare drop any of it. Sophie stands stiffly, manner petulant. SOPHIE (indignant) It's your fault, Mama. NAJWA (incredulous) My fault? Excuse me? The squabble continues, Sophie playfully chiding Najwa for her slow response. SOPHIE (teasing) You took forever! NAJWA (sarcastically) So you drop a load in your pants? Real mature. Sophie's retort is tinged with a spiteful mirth, conflicting pride in her voice. SOPHIE (defensively) Had to go, Ma! You don't understand. Najwa's response is met with a mutinous grumble, Sophie's admission notwithstanding. SOPHIE \\"testing the waters\\" with her hand on her pants (inspecting the damage) Still... did feel good, relief n' all. NAJWA (disbelieving the audacity) You're not getting any points for this. Sophie's playful sulk suddenly shifts as Najwa steps closer, her purpose clear. NAJWA (getting a closer look) Let's see the damage, then. With weak protest, Sophie turns, the bulging sweatpants telling a graphic tale. NAJWA (taunting) Enjoy it, did you? With how much is in there... Sophie's cheeky rejoinder sparks a new round of bickering, accentuated by the padding of her pants. SOPHIE It's not like that. Just... glad it's out. Relief, y'know? NAJWA (scoffing) Nasty. Shouldn't have let it come to this. The roles of mother and wayward child are amplified, their exchange humorously theatrical in its unfolding. NAJWA (sniffing) Smell ya from a mile away! Sophie declares her pungent presence, nudging the situation playfully. SOPHIE (at her own stench) Well, since I'm being held hostage... Najwa gives her final, scolding command, ushering her daughter towards cleanliness. NAJWA (dismissing the jest) Enough! Just... get cleaned up. No trail! The duo makes their slow, comical journey, Sophie whimpering at the tactile sensation while Najwa fusses. SOPHIE Worried expression (whispering) Feels like it's gonna fall... NAJWA (impatient) Better not, or you're scrubbing it up! At the bathroom threshold, Sophie aims for one last gibe, hand on her soiled seat, simulating a diaper change offer. SOPHIE (playfully) Diaper change, Mama? Najwa's hand grips the bulk of Sophie's disgrace, her mocking rebuttal pushing the wayward daughter forward with calculated squishes. NAJWA (forcefully ushering) Just get in there, you filthy— Sophie hollers, her skin crawling at the squishy spread across her backside, finally stepping into the bathroom for sanctuary. SOPHIE (aghast) It's all... squashed! The door slams shut, Najwa's last words floating through the air, her voice a mix of mirth and motherly exasperation. NAJWA (to herself, still holding her nose) How on Earth did we raise a stinker like her?

원리를 반영하여 구축됩니다. 건축물의 설계와 구성에서 중요한 역할을 하는 몇 가지 물리학적 개념들을 살펴보겠습니다: 1. **힘과 토크 (Torque)**: 건축가들은 건물의 안정성을 보장하기 위해 구조물이 받게 될 힘과 토크를 계산합니다. 이는 풍 Load, 지진 등과 같은 외부 힘에 대한 건물의 회전과 움직임을 최소화하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 2. **재료의 물리적 성질**: 강도, 탄성, 밀도, 열전도성 등 재료의 물리적 성질은 건물의 구조적 안전성, 지속 가능성, 그리고 에너지 효율성을 결정합니다. 예를 들어, 고층 건물에 사용되는 강철은 높은 인장 강도를 가지고 있어야 하며, 단열재는 열전도율이 낮아야 합니다. 3. **힘의 분산**: 구조물은 지지하는 하중을 균등하게 분산해야합니다. 이는 아치, 돔, 삼각형 등의 기하학적 형상을 활용하여 수행됩니다. 예를 들어, 아치는 양쪽 끝의 지점으로 힘을 전달하는 효과적인 구조입니다. 4. **진동과 공진**: 건물은 바람이나 지진과 같은 외부 요인으로 인해 진동할 수 있습니다. 건물의 고유 진동수와 외부 힘의 주파수가 일치하면 공진이 발생하여 구조적 손상을 일으킬 수 있습니다. 공진을 방지하기 위해, 건축물은 특정 주파수 범위를 피해 설계되거나 완충 장치가 추가됩니다. 5. **열역학**: 건축물은 열 효율을 극대화하기 위해 설계됩니다. 이는 단열재 사용, 난방 및 냉방 시스템 설계, 그리고 창문의 배치와 크기를 조정함으로써 달성될 수 있습니다. 또한 건물의 에너지 소비를 최소화하고 편안한 환경을 창출하기 위해 패시브 솔라 디자인 원칙이 종종 사용됩니다. 6. **광학**: 자연광 이용, 반사와 산란 제어는 건물 내의 조명 설계에 있어 중요한 역할을 합니다. 최적의 창문 배치와 유리의 종류 선택은 건물 내에 충분한 자연광을 유도하며, 적절한 재질 선택은 빛의 반사와 흡수를 관장합니다. 7. **음향학**: 음향 에너지는 공간 내에서 반사, 흡수 및 산란됩니다. 극장, 콘서트홀, 학교 강의실 등 특정 목적의 건축물은 음향학적 설계를 고려하여 음질을 최적화합니다. 일반적으로 구조 엔지니어와 건축가는 협력하여 이러한 물리학적 원리를 적절하고 안전한 방식으로 건축물 디자인에 녹여냅니다. 지속 가능한 건축과 스마트 건축물의 등장으로 이러한 원리들은 더욱 발전되고 있으며, 물리학은 전 세계적으로 더 나은 살기 좋은 환경을 만드는 데 핵심적인 역할을 하고

열적 평형에 있습니다. 이 법칙은 온도의 개념과 측정의 일관성을 바탕으로 하며 온도계를 의미 있게 만듭니다. 2. **첫 번째 법칙 (열역학 제1법칙)**: 일종의 에너지 보존 법칙으로, 우주의 총 에너지는 일정하다고 합니다. 에너지는 형태를 바꿀 수는 있어도 창조되거나 소멸되지 않습니다. 이 법칙은 열과 일이 에너지 형태이며 에너지가 계 내부와 외부 간에 전달될 수 있다고 설명합니다. 3. **두 번째 법칙 (열역학 제2법칙)**: 한 시스템의 에너지는 스스로 높은 에너지 상태에서 낮은 에너지 상태로 변환할 수 있으나, 그 반대로 변환되기 위해서는 외부의 작용이 필요합니다. 엔트로피라는 개념이 이 법칙과 관련되어 있는데, 일반적으로 닫힌 시스템의 엔트로피는 시간이 지날수록 증가하거나 동일하게 유지됩니다. 엔트로피 증가는 전체적인 \\"무질서도\\"의 증가와 관련이 있으며, 에너지의 효율적 사용에 한계를 두는 핵심 원리입니다. 4. **세 번째 법칙 (열역학 제3법칙)**: 절대영도에 가까워짐에 따라, 모든 순수한 결정성 물질의 엔트로피는 접근할 수 없는 한계 값에 이릅니다. (즉, 결정의 엔트로피 S가 절대영도에서 0에 도달) 절대영도(0 켈빈, -273.15°C)에서는 원자나 분자의 열 운동이 완전히 멈춘다고 가정됩니다. 열역학은 일상생활부터 산업, 우주과학, 화학, 생물학 등 폭넓은 분야에 걸쳐 적용됩니다. 예를 들어, 엔지니어와 과학자들은 열역학적 원리를 이용해 엔진, 냉장고, 발전소와 같은 열기계를 설계하고 최적화합니다. 화학 반응의 자발성을 결정하는 것부터 생물체의 에너지 대사, 그리고 기후 변화에 이르기까지 열역학은 자연계 전반의 에너지 변환과 전달 방식을 이해하는 데 필수적인 학문입니다."},{"prompt":"napisz o OSP Grzmiąca","completion":"OSP Grzmiąca to Ochotnicza Straż Pożarna działająca w miejscowości Grzmiąca.

Jest to stan, w którym organizm nie ma wystarczającej ilości insuliny, a zamiast tego metabolizuje tłuszcze jako źródło energii. W wyniku tego procesu w organizmie gromadzą się ketony, które są produktem ubocznym metabolizmu tłuszczów. Objawy kwasicy ketonowej mogą obejmować nudności, wymioty, ból brzucha, oddech zapachający acetonem, utratę wagi, senność, szybkie oddychanie i niepokój. Jest to stan, który wymaga natychmiastowego leczenia medycznego. W leczeniu kwasicy ketonowej często wykorzystuje się insulinę do obniżenia poziomu cukru we krwi i zahamowania produkcji ketonów. Dodatkowo może być konieczne podawanie płynów dożylnie w celu nawodnienia organizmu i uniknięcia odwodnienia. W niektórych przypadkach może być również stosowana suplementacja elektrolitami, aby przywrócić równowagę elektrolitową. Ważne jest, aby w przypadku podejrzenia kwasicy ketonowej jak najszybciej skontaktować się z lekarzem lub udać się na pogotowie ratunkowe. Nieleczona kwasica ketonowa może prowadzić do poważnych komplikacji, takich jak uszkodzenie narządów, śpiączka lub nawet zagrożenie życia. Aby uniknąć kwasicy ketonowej, istotne jest odpowiednie zarządzanie cukrzycą, w tym systematyczne monitorowanie poziomu cukru we krwi, regularne przyjmowanie insuliny lub innych leków przepisanych przez lekarza, zdrowa dieta i regularna aktywność fizyczna. W przypadku wystąpienia objawów kwasicy ketonowej, należy niezwłocznie skonsultować się z lekarzem w celu oceny i leczenia."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA - DAY** The cafeteria is buzzing with the chatter of students enjoying their lunches. Natural light floods in through large windows. Several food stations featuring an array of cuisines give the space an international feel. Two Lebanese American college seniors, LAYLA and NADIA, both in their early 20s, grab their food trays and find a table in the center of the room. LAYLA is dressed in a stylish yet casual outfit, with a playful scarf tied around her neck, and NADIA sports a vibrant band tee and ripped jeans. **LAYLA** (to Nadia) You would not believe the morning I had. Prof. Mansour's pop quiz was brutal! **NADIA** (grinning) Oh, come on. You always say that and end up with the top score. Anyway, enough about quizzes. Did you hear about the party at Sigma Chi tonight? **LAYLA** (sighing) That's the third time someone's asked me today. I have a mountain of work to climb, Nadia. They start picking at their food -- a blend of Middle Eastern dishes including tabbouleh, kibbeh, hummus, and an ample portion of labneh. **NADIA** (poiting at Layla's food with her fork) Then choose the easier mountain! Tabbouleh over textbooks! They laugh, but Layla's smile fades quickly. **LAYLA** (serious, almost reprimanding) Nadia, how do you expect to get into grad school if you keep this up? **NADIA** (defensive) Layla, chill. I've got my own plans, okay? Not all of us wanna follow the straight and narrow like you. The tension starts building with each bite. **LAYLA** (annoyed) Straight and narrow? Really? There's nothing wrong with having a goal, Nadia. **NADIA** (jabs her fork in the air) And there's nothing wrong with figuring things out as you go! LAYLA (frustrated, voice raising) But that's just it! You're never figuring things out. You're just floating along! NADIA (slamming her hand on the table) Look who's talking, Miss Perfect! You have your whole life planned out, bas khalas! (bas khalas = enough in Arabic) Other students start to glance over, sensing the escalation. LAYLA (eyes flashing) You know what, Nadia? If having a plan is such a crime, then— She's cut off as NADIA, with a frustrated huff, flicks a spoonful of hummus that lands on LAYLA'S scarf. LAYLA (shocked) Did you just...? NADIA (standing up, arms crossed) Yeah, I did. What are you gonna do about it, huh? Plan your retaliation? The cafeteria's atmosphere shifts as students start to pick up on the absurdity. LAYLA, a look of disbelief rapidly changing to one of mischief, stands up too. LAYLA You know, I just might. She scoops up a dollop of labneh, aims deliberately, and the cold dairy lands right atop NADIA'S head, creating a creamy, dripping mess. NADIA (hands in her hair, stunned) Labneh? Seriously? She grabs a falafel ball and chucks it at LAYLA, who dodges, and it hits an unsuspecting student behind her (OMAR, 20s, jovial and bearded). OMAR (surprised, then amused) Hey! In the middle of a food fight and you bring a falafel to a labneh battle? NADIA and LAYLA look at each other, trying to stifle their laughter. They both shout an apology to OMAR, whose comment breaks the tension between them. NADIA (giggling, wiping labneh off) You are so dead, Layla. LAYLA (laughing) Come at me, Habibti! (Habibti = my love) A playful standoff ensues. The students in the cafeteria are now full-on spectators, with a few adventurous ones joining in on the food fight. A KIBBEH flies in slow motion across the room, only to be intercepted by a pita bread like a goalie blocking a shot. **OMAR** (to other students) Form a league, boys! Team Falafel vs. Team Labneh! NADIA and LAYLA are now tossing olives back and forth, laughing hysterically amidst the chaos of friendly culinary combat. CUT TO: **INT. CAFETERIA - LATER** The food fight has ended. NADIA and LAYLA sit back at their table, covered head-to-toe in a mosaic of meals, laughing uncontrollably. Custodial staff shake their heads but can't help smirking at the scene. LAYLA (teary-eyed from laughing) Okay, okay, ceasefire. Let's never fight like that again. NADIA (grinning, using pita to clean the mess) Deal. Bas next time, less labneh on the hair, eh? LAYLA (shrugs, playful) I can't promise that! They fist bump, a seal of their rekindled friendship.

SMALL COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY We're in a quaint kitchen with colorful posters on the walls, pots and pans dangling from a ceiling rack, and neatly organized spices on the counter. A sizzling sound comes from a frying pan on the stove. The scent of garlic, onions, and Za’atar seems to come through the screen. LAILA (22, dark wavy hair in a messy bun, dressed in a comfy oversized sweater and leggings) stands over the stove, skillfully flipping what appears to be mana’eesh. She hums a Lebanese tune, lost in the moment. JENNA (22, sporting a ponytail, a T-shirt of a popular indie band and cut-off jean shorts) sits at a counter cluttered with textbooks and scattered notes, chewing pensively on the end of her pencil. They both have a distinctly Lebanese-American air about them, down to their smooth accents when they speak. JENNA (muttering without looking up) If Foucault's right, we're all just doomed pigeons in society's grand experiment. LAILA (looking over, teasingly) You know, philosophizing on an empty stomach only leads to existential dread. Or worse, you actually understanding Foucault. JENNA (shrugging, a wry smile) I’ll take my chances. What's the mana’eesh flavor of the day, chef? LAILA (proudly) Za’atar with a hint of philosopher's angst, à la Jenna. Ready in two. Laila flips the mana’eesh onto a plate and slides it toward Jenna, who looks at it skeptically before her stomach overrules her brain and she takes a huge bite. The flavors explode in her mouth, and her eyes light up. JENNA (mouth full) Holy – this is amazing! What did you put in this? LAILA (smirking) It's a secret recipe passed down from the ancient philosophers themselves. They share a chuckle, but Jenna’s face suddenly drops as she notices a mark on the mana’eesh. JENNA (earnestly pointing) Hey, what's this black thing? Is it burnt? LAILA (glancing over) Eh, it's just a lil' crispy. It adds character. JENNA (playfully, but with feigned hurt) A lil' crispy? Laila, my mana’eesh dignity is shattered. Is this how you repay my taste buds? LAILA (rolling her eyes) Oh, please. Your tongue wouldn’t know gourmet if it did debke on it. Immediately, the atmosphere shifts from playful to mock contentious. Jenna, with a mischievous glint in her eye, grabs a jar of pickles from the fridge. JENNA (slyly) Oh, we’re talking about taste buds, huh? Maybe they need a little... refreshing! Laila’s eyes widen as Jenna pops the jar open and hurls a pickle her way. Laila ducks, and it hits the wall, sliding down comically. LAILA (laughing but with mock outrage) Jenna! You declare culinary war? JENNA (grinning) Consider it declared! Laila grabs a fistful of parsley from a cutting board and throws it at Jenna like a bouquet at a wedding. Jenna shields herself with a textbook, but the parsley clings to her hair. JENNA (giggling uncontrollably) Parsley? That's your weapon of choice? LAILA (raising an eyebrow) Oh, sweetheart, you ain't seen nothin’ yet. It’s an out-and-out food fight now. Jenna returns fire with chickpeas from a salad. Laila spins, kicking up a cloud of flour like a ninja poofing a smoke bomb. Laughter peals out as the kitchen becomes a hailstorm of edible projectiles. Jenna grabs a pomegranate, opens it, and lobs a handful of seeds. Laila is hit by the ruby barrage. LAILA (wiping a seed off her cheek) Alright, that's how it's gonna be? Laila spots a bowl of labneh, and a slow smile spreads across her face. Jenna, still chuckling and unaware, is reaching for the last of the pomegranate seeds. Laila with a battle cry that would make her ancestors proud, scoops up a dollop of labneh, and it's slow-motion – the blob arcs through the air, landing squarely and comically on Jenna’s head. JENNA (shocked) So, we escalated to dairy products? All at once, the absurdity of their flour-dusted, chickpea-studded, and now labneh-topped appearances strikes them. In unison, they burst into unrestrained laughter, their earlier argument forgotten. The kitchen is a mess, but their laughter is infectious, pure, and personal. LAILA (out of breath) I’m sorry, that was... I just... JENNA (wiping labneh from her eyes, grinning) ...Perfect? LAILA (nodding, still laughing) Perfect. They continue to laugh, sitting on the flour-dusted floor amidst their culinary chaos, arms draped over each other’s shoulders like comrades after a jovial battle. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"Has anyone ever made a 1 bpm song?","completion":"Yes, there have been several songs composed with a tempo of 1 beat per minute (bpm). One notable example is the song \\"One\\" by John Cage. It was composed in 1987 and consists of only one sustained piano chord played with extremely long pauses between the strikes. The song lasts for about 20 minutes, giving it a tempo of approximately 1 bpm. This experimental piece is considered avant-garde music and challenges traditional notions of rhythm and composition."},{"prompt":"Half bpm?","completion":"Creating a song with a half-beat per minute (0.5 bpm) would be highly unusual and challenging, as it would involve extremely long intervals between successive beats. To my knowledge, I couldn't find any specific examples of songs with such a slow tempo. However, there may be experimental or avant-garde compositions that explore extremely minimalistic and extended durations between notes or beats, approaching this kind of slow tempo. Keep in mind that extremely slow tempos can challenge our perception of musical rhythm and may not fit within traditional musical conventions."},{"prompt":"Whats the highest bpm song","completion":"The highest recorded bpm (beats per minute) for a song is disputed and depends on various factors, including genre, style, and interpretation. However, one commonly cited example of an extremely fast song is \\"Thousand\\" by Moha! The song is known for its highly accelerated speed, with an estimated bpm ranging from 1,500 to 1,700 bpm. It falls under a genre called \\"extra-fast noise music\\" or \\"extratone,\\" known for its relentless and extreme speed. It's worth noting that songs with such high bpms often employ rapid electronic manipulation and programming rather than traditional acoustic instrumentation."},{"prompt":"Can you make a song without a bpm, a c","completion":"Technically, a song without a discernible bpm (beats per minute) is challenging to create as bpm is a fundamental aspect of rhythm. However, it's possible to compose a song without a strict, consistent bpm, allowing for more fluid and free-flowing rhythm. This approach is often seen in certain styles of ambient music, where the emphasis is on creating a calm and immersive sonic atmosphere rather than adhering to a specific tempo. In such cases, the music may have fluctuating tempos, irregular rhythms, or no discernible pulse, resulting in a more abstract and ethereal listening experience."},{"prompt":"Are there any?","completion":"Yes, there are genres of music that may not have a strict, consistent bpm or adhere to traditional rhythmic structures. Some examples include: 1. Ambient Music: Ambient music often focuses more on creating atmospheric textures and sonic landscapes rather than rhythmic patterns. While there may be subtle rhythms or pulsations present, they are often fluid and fluctuating, without a specific bpm. 2. Free Improvisation: Free improvisation is a style of music where performers explore spontaneous creation, often without predetermined structures or strict rhythmic guidelines. In this context, the absence of a fixed bpm allows for complete freedom and flexibility in the timing and pacing of the music. 3. Some Avant-Garde or Experimental Music: Certain avant-garde or experimental compositions may purposely reject a strict bpm and rhythm, embracing unpredictability and irregularity in their musical structures. These pieces may explore unconventional time signatures or employ aleatoric techniques where the timing and rhythm are left to chance or performer interpretation. While these genres may not have a clear and consistent bpm, they still incorporate elements of rhythm and timing, even if they are more fluid or abstract."},{"prompt":"What is upbeat/hardstyle bpm?","completion":"Upbeat music typically refers to music with an energetic and positive feel, often characterized by a higher tempo. In the context of electronic dance music (EDM), genres such as hardstyle are known for their fast and driving beats. Hardstyle music usually ranges between 150 and 160 beats per minute (bpm). The style typically features prominent kick drums, strong melodic elements, and intense synth sounds. The fast tempo, combined with energetic melodies and aggressive beats, creates an uplifting and euphoric atmosphere on the dancefloor. Hardstyle's high bpm makes it suitable for high-energy and intense dancing."},{"prompt":"Well what is upbeat bpm","completion":"Upbeat music tends to have a lively and energetic feel, often encouraging a positive and uplifting mood. While the term \\"upbeat\\" does not refer to a specific range of bpm, it generally encompasses faster tempos that inspire movement and dancing. In popular music, upbeat songs usually fall within a range of around 120 to 140 bpm. However, it's important to note that the perception of an upbeat tempo can vary across different genres and styles of music. For example, in electronic dance music (EDM), upbeat genres like house, trance, or drum and bass tend to have higher tempos ranging from around 120 to 180 bpm. Meanwhile, genres like pop, rock, or disco may have more moderate tempos around 100 to 130 bpm. Ultimately, what is considered upbeat depends on the specific genre and the preferences of the listener."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

COLLEGE SENIOR'S OFF-CAMPUS APARTMENT - DAY The apartment is modest, with vintage posters on the walls and a mismatched array of furniture. There's an eclectic charm to the space, showing the personality of two college seniors who have made it their own. We see MAYA (22, Lebanese American, long wavy brown hair, a nose ring, wearing an oversized college hoodie and leggings) and LAYLA (21, Lebanese American, short curly hair, bright eyes, wearing a band tee and ripped jeans), cooking and chatting in a small but cozy kitchen. MAYA is at the stove flipping man'oushe, while LAYLA is chopping vegetables for a fattoush salad. The sun filters through a window, casting a warm glow over the friendly chaos in the kitchen. MAYA Just saying, Layla, if you had just reminded me about the econ assignment, I wouldn’t have had to pull an all-nighter. LAYLA (poking fun) Oh, so now it's my job to schedule your life? Should I remind you to breathe next? MAYA (giggling) No, no... that wouldn't match with my aesthetic of being the hot mess friend. As they banter back and forth, the scene is light and comical. It's clear they've had these kinds of silly arguments many times before. LAYLA (starting to toss a salad) Breathtaking hot mess indeed. But let's get serious—do we put onions in this? MAYA (faux-dramatically) Not if you want us to survive our afternoon lectures without killing someone with our breath! They both chuckle, but Maya's jovial demeanor shifts a bit as she starts another topic, her voice tightens slightly as she focuses on cooking. MAYA (restrained) Oh, and I ran into Kevin yesterday. Guess he's back with his ex. LAYLA (grating cucumber) The one who comments on all your Insta posts with those thirsty emojis? MAYA (irritated) I think his phone just auto-populates heart-eyes whenever I post. LAYLA (playfully) Maybe Kevin's ex is onto something then, huh, hot mess? Maya turns around with a half-cooked man'oushe in her spatula, a glint in her eye, but Layla has already started laughing, realizing she's struck a nerve. MAYA (sarcastically) Ha-ha, very funny. MAYA throws the man'oushe onto a plate, but in doing so, a bit of za'atar sprinkles onto LAYLA’s arm. The situation escalates as they lock eyes, each daring the other to make the next move. LAYLA Oh, it's on! With that declaration, LAYLA playfully flicks some water from the cucumber onto MAYA. The smirk on MAYA's face shows she's up for the challenge. They begin to throw small bits of vegetables and spices at each other, tiptoeing around the laughter and the playfulness of a food fight. Maya grabs a handful of cherry tomatoes and gently lobs them at LAYLA, who ducks, shrieking with laughter. LAYLA retaliates with a piece of lettuce, but quickly the food fight takes an artistic edge as LAYLA gets an idea. LAYLA You need some parsley, let me enhance your look! She sprinkles parsley over MAYA's hair, and they both burst out in laughter. The fight goes back and forth, with them both giggling, covered in bits of salad and spices. However, MAYA spots the bowl of labneh sitting on the counter and pauses with a wide grin, having found her weapon of choice. LAYLA sees what MAYA is eyeing and starts to back away, her eyes wide. LAYLA (in mock horror) Don’t you dare, Maya! MAYA (trying to hold in her laughter) Oh, it's happening! MAYA grabs a spoonful of labneh and chases LAYLA around the small kitchen. LAYLA squeals, trying to evade the dairy doom looming over her head. As MAYA gets close, she slips on a slice of tomato on the floor, careening towards LAYLA. In slow-motion, both women watch as the dollop of labneh flies through the air, heading straight for LAYLA’s head. It lands with a majestic splat, leaving white globs dripping down LAYLA's shocked face and curling hair. The kitchen falls silent for a split-second before laughter erupts from them both. MAYA clutches her stomach, laughing so hard she can hardly breathe. LAYLA (gasping for air) You are SO dead, Maya! But LAYLA is laughing too much to sound threatening. They lean against each other for support, their laughter echoing in the small kitchen. After a good laugh, they both collapse onto the floor, sitting amongst their mess. Stray olives and sprigs of mint are scattered around them as they catch their breath and wipe tears of joy from their cheeks. MAYA (apologetically, but still chuckling) You have to admit, that was epic. LAYLA (good-naturedly) Epic, yeah. Wait ‘til you see the epic revenge plan I’ve got brewing. MAYA (offering a truce) Clean up and truce over hummus? LAYLA (smirking) Deal. But I'm choosing the music. They get up, brushing themselves off and start cleaning up, occasionally flinging a rogue cucumber slice in jest.

The total earnings E can be expressed as E = 6t + 1500 . Given the goal of 5100, the equation becomes 6t + 1500 = 5100 . Subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate 6t , then divide by 6 to find t . The band needs to sell 600 tickets to reach the 5100 goal. Explain the process and reason for each of the steps in finding the solutions of your problems","completion":"The given problem is asking us to find the number of tickets, represented by \\"t,\\" that the band needs to sell in order to reach a goal of 5100 in earnings. In the equation E = 6t + 1500, E represents the total earnings and is equal to 6 times the number of tickets sold (6t) plus an additional 1500. This equation represents the band's total earnings as a function of the number of tickets sold. To find the value of t, which represents the number of tickets sold, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 1500 from both sides of the equation: E - 1500 = 6t + 1500 - 1500 This simplifies to: E - 1500 = 6t Now, we have isolated 6t on the right side of the equation. To solve for t, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 6: (E - 1500) / 6 = (6t) / 6 This simplifies to: (E - 1500) / 6 = t Now, we have found that t is equal to (E - 1500) divided by 6. Next, we substitute the given goal of 5100 for E in the equation: t = (5100 - 1500) / 6 Simplifying further: t = 3600 / 6 t = 600 Therefore, the band needs to sell 600 tickets to reach their goal of 5100 in earnings. Each step in this solution process follows basic principles of algebra, such as isolating the variable by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation and simplifying expressions. The reasoning behind each step is to manipulate the equation in a way that allows us to isolate the variable and ultimately solve for its value."},{"prompt":"The band realizes that the number of tickets they sell depends on the price of the ticket.

According to the given information, the number of tickets the band will sell depends on the price of the ticket, x. It is given that they will sell 800-20x tickets. To determine the amount of money the band will make at a ticket price of 6, we need to multiply the price by the number of tickets sold: Money made = Price of ticket * Number of tickets sold = 6 * (800-20x) Let's substitute x = 6 into the equation and calculate the money made: Money made = 6 * (800 - (20 * 6)) Simplifying further: Money made = 6 * (800 - 120) = 6 * 680 = 4080 Therefore, if the band sets the ticket price at 6, they will make 4080. To determine if this amount is enough to reach their goal of 5100, we compare the money made with the goal earnings: Money made = 4080 Goal earnings = 5100 Since 4080 is less than 5100, this means that the band will not reach their goal by selling tickets at 6 each. In terms of the steps taken to solve the problem, we first established the equation to calculate the money made based on the ticket price and the number of tickets sold. Then, we substituted the given ticket price of 6 into the equation and performed the necessary calculations to find the money made. Finally, we compared this amount with the goal earnings to determine whether the band would reach their goal. Unfortunately, as shown by the calculations and reasoning, selling tickets at 6 each will not be enough for the band to reach their 5100 earnings goal."},{"prompt":"list the steps taken, on a second list explain the reasoning","completion":"Here is a breakdown of the steps taken to solve the problem, along with an explanation of the reasoning behind each step: Steps taken: 1. Write the equation to calculate the money made: Money made = Price of ticket * Number of tickets sold. 2. Substitute x = 6 (the given ticket price) into the equation. 3. Calculate the number of tickets sold at a price of 6: 800 - (20 * 6). 4. Simplify the expression: 800 - 120 = 680. 5. Multiply the ticket price by the number of tickets sold: 6 * 680. 6. Perform the calculation: 6 * 680 = 4080. Reasoning: 1. We need to establish an equation to determine the money made by multiplying the ticket price by the number of tickets sold. This equation represents the relationship between the price of the ticket and the resulting earnings. 2. We substitute x = 6 into the equation because we are given that the band sets the ticket price at 6. 3. To find the number of tickets sold at a price of 6, we substitute x = 6 into the given relationship: 800 - (20 * 6). 4. Simplifying the expression allows us to calculate the actual quantity of tickets sold. In this case, 800 - 120 gives us 680 tickets sold. 5. We multiply the price of the ticket (6) by the number of tickets sold (680) to find the money made. 6. Performing the multiplication provides us with the amount of money the band will make, which is 4080. By following these steps and providing the corresponding reasoning, we have determined that at a ticket price of 6, the band will make 4080. However, since this amount is less than their goal of 5100 in earnings, the band will not reach their goal by selling tickets at this price."},{"prompt":"Explain the process and reason for each of the steps in finding the solutions of your problems","completion":"Sure! Let's break down the process and reasoning behind each step taken to find the solutions to the problems: 1. Write the equation to calculate the money made: Money made = Price of ticket * Number of tickets sold. - We start by setting up an equation to represent the relationship between the price of the ticket and the resulting earnings. The amount of money made is equal to the price of the ticket multiplied by the number of tickets sold. 2. Substitute x = 6 (the given ticket price) into the equation. - Since we are given that the band sets the ticket price at 6, we substitute this value into the equation for the price of the ticket. 3. Calculate the number of tickets sold at a price of 6: 800 - (20 * 6). - According to the information given, the band sells 800-20x tickets, where x is the price of the ticket. So we substitute x = 6 into this expression to calculate the number of tickets sold at a price of 6. 4. Simplify the expression: 800 - 120 = 680. - By performing the multiplication and subtraction, we simplify the expression to find that the number of tickets sold at a price of 6 is 680. 5. Multiply the ticket price by the number of tickets sold: 6 * 680. - We multiply the price of the ticket (6) by the number of tickets sold (680) to find the total amount of money made. 6. Perform the calculation: 6 * 680 = 4080. - By multiplying 6 and 680, we find that the band will make 4080 by selling 680 tickets at a price of 6 each. Each step in this process is crucial to solving the problem and finding the desired solutions. By following these steps, we are able to determine the amount of money the band will make and assess whether it is enough to reach their goal."},{"prompt":"make it much shorter","completion":"Sure! Here is a shorter explanation of the process and reasoning for each step in finding the solutions to the problem: 1. Equation: Money made = Price of ticket * Number of tickets sold. - We set up an equation representing the relationship between ticket price and earnings. 2. Substitute x = 6: Money made = 6 * (800 - 20 * 6). - We substitute the given ticket price of 6 into the equation. 3. Simplify: Money made = 4080. - By performing the calculations, we find that the band will make 4080 with a ticket price of 6. 4. Compare with goal: 4080 < 5100. - We compare the earnings with the goal of 5100. Based on the calculations and reasoning, the band will make 4080 with a ticket price of 6, but this is less than their goal of 5100."},{"prompt":"За сеть и за интернет отвечает один единственный разъем — … a.

However, when comparing the imitation to the original voice, several factors contribute to the margin of error: 1. **Clarity**: Parrots may not enunciate words as clearly as humans do. While some can come very close, there may still be slight differences in clarity that would indicate the voice is an imitation. 2. **Intonation and Cadence**: Parrots can mimic the pitch and melody of speech but may not reproduce the intonation and cadence with 100% accuracy. Their vocal tracts are different from humans', which can limit their ability to reproduce the exact speech patterns. 3. **Accent and Pronunciation**: Imitations may not capture regional accents or the subtleties of pronunciation. Parrots mimic what they hear, but the nuances of human speech can sometimes be lost or generalized in their mimicry. 4. **Timbre and Quality**: The voice's timbre, which is the unique quality or tone, may be the most challenging aspect for a parrot to replicate thoroughly, due to anatomical differences. 5. **Consistency**: While a parrot could imitate a word or phrase quite closely on one occasion, it might not be as accurate on another. Their performance can vary each time they reproduce the sound. Quantifying the margin of error in a parrot's imitation of human speech can be difficult without specific scientific analysis, and it can vary greatly from one parrot to another, and from one word or sound to another. In general, the imitation would likely not withstand a rigorous phonetic analysis but may be convincing in more casual settings. In terms of perceivable error, humans can usually tell the difference between a parrot's mimicry and a human voice, even when the imitation is exceptionally good. This difference could be subtle or quite pronounced depending on the individual bird and its imitating capabilities. Advanced technology, such as voice recognition software, could analyze and quantify the deviations in frequency, tone, and speech patterns to provide a more definitive margin of error."},{"prompt":"Have people ever used parrots like phonograph machines in the past?","completion":"There is no well-documented history of using parrots functionally as phonograph machines or for systematically recording and playing back messages as devices. Parrots' mimicry abilities have mainly been a source of fascination, entertainment, and companionship for people. However, there are anecdotal stories and tales where parrots have been noted for their ability to mimic speech, sounds, and sometimes even entire conversations with remarkable accuracy. For instance, there are: 1. **Stories in literature**: Several literary works feature parrots that memorize and repeat phrases or conversations, often leading to humorous or plot-relevant consequences. 2. **Historical accounts**: Instances where parrots have allegedly repeated words or phrases they've overheard, sometimes to the surprise or embarrassment of their owners. These accounts are often anecdotal and not documented for practical use. 3. **Court cases and crimes**: There have been a few sensationalized news stories where parrots have supposedly repeated phrases related to criminal acts or distressing situations they have witnessed. These stories are often more tabloid fodder than credible evidence, and law enforcement does not consider parrots reliable witnesses. It is important to note that while parrots can mimic speech they have heard, deliberately using them as recording devices would not have been particularly reliable or practical. Their mimicry is not guaranteed to play back a message accurately or on command as a phonograph would. Moreover, before the invention and widespread use of phonographs, there were already more reliable means of transmitting messages, including written notes and human messengers. In conclusion, while the idea of using parrots as living recording devices might make for interesting stories, it has not been a widespread or practical application in reality. The phonograph and other recording technologies eventually provided reliable and repeatable means of recording sound, which surpassed any novelty associated with using animals for such purposes."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series.

COLLEGE SENIOR DORM ROOM - NIGHT LAILA, a tall Lebanese-American girl with long, curly dark hair and a hint of an artist's chaotic vibe in her attire, is dancing around the room as she gets ready for a night out. She’s humming to the latest pop hit. Her room is a mix of vibrant dorm decor and traditional Middle Eastern accents. MAYA, slightly shorter with straight, shoulder-length hair and an edgier style, sits at a desk littered with textbooks and notes, typing on her laptop. She's the more organized of the two, evident from her side of the room, which is tidy and methodical. LAILA (calling out) Maya, babe! Are you sure you don't wanna come? It's gonna be epic. MAYA (without looking up) Laila, you know I have to finish this paper. Go, have fun, leave me to wallow in academic misery. Laila flops down beside Maya, dramatically clutching her chest. LAILA But your absence will lay heavy on my soul! MAYA (dryly) Survive somehow, dramatic one. Laila laughs and gets up, opening the mini-fridge. LAILA (eyeing the contents) I'll make a snack before I head out. You want something? MAYA Nah, I'm good. Thanks though. LAILA (pulling out a container) Labneh! Perfect. Maya glances up, a mini scowl on her face. MAYA That's my labneh, Laila. LAILA (sarcastically) Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot we had a signing ceremony for the fridge contents. MAYA (slightly irritated) I just bought that for my breakfasts, okay? LAILA (relaxed) Chill, I’ll buy you a new one tomorrow. MAYA (raising her voice) That's not the point, Laila! It’s about respect. And you eating my labneh is just... peak you! LAILA (raising an eyebrow) Peak me? What's that supposed to mean? MAYA (heatedly) It means you take my stuff without asking, ignore my schedules and... and... you’re just always all over the place! LAILA (getting defensive) Okay, first of all, we always share food. And second, what's up with you tonight? You're really lashin' out here! MAYA (struggling to maintain composure) I'm just tired, Laila. Tired of coming second to your whims. LAILA (affronted) My whims? Oh, that's rich. What about your endless rules? MAYA (shouting) Your chaos is unbearable sometimes! The tension is thick. Laila's eyes flicker with a challenging glint. She scoops a dollop of labneh onto her finger. LAILA Chaos, huh? Splat. She flicks the labneh. It lands on Maya's nose. MAYA (disbelief) Did you just...? Without missing a beat, Maya grabs a pencil from the desk and catapults an olive from a small plate at Laila. LAILA (surprised) Oh, it's on! What ensues is an acrobatic FOOD FIGHT, as both girls forget the argument and go all in. They launch paper balls soaked in soda, lob handfuls of hummus. There's laughter between the dodges and playful teasing. MAYA (grinning, dodging a pastry) Your aim is as bad as your taste in music! LAILA (launching breadcrumbs) At least I have taste, Miss 'Study Playlist Only!' They’re covered in an array of food. Laila, with a twinkle in her eye, spots the labneh container, her final, messy piece de resistance. LAILA (slyly) Oh, Maya! With a war cry, LAILA lobs the LABNEH. Maya's eyes grow wide as it splats right on top of her head, the white cream oozing down. Beat. Stunned silence. Then, LAILA BURSTS into HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER, unable to contain herself. MAYA stares at her, a GHOST OF A SMIRK forming under the labneh mask. MAYA (deadpan) You're dead meat. LAILA (laughing HPysterically) Oh come on... that was classic! Maya can’t help but start LAUGHING too. They're both breaking into UNCONTROLLABLE GIGGLES, food dripping from their clothes and hair. The fight is forgotten as quickly as it started, replaced with the levity of the absurd moment. MAYA (wiping labneh off her face) You're buying me two labnehs now. LAILA (putting her arm around Maya) Deal! But we're framing this look for Halloween. They SIT DOWN amid the culinary carnage, still cackling.

COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY The apartment is cozy and has a lived-in quality with an eclectic mix of posters and tapestries adorning the walls. The kitchen counters are cluttered with textbooks, a laptop, and half-opened snack packages. We see LAYLA and RIMA, both in their early twenties, seated across from each other at a small kitchen table. Layla has wavy brown hair tied in a messy bun, a pierced nose, and she wears a relaxed hoodie and yoga pants. Rima has her straight black hair in a sleek ponytail, minimal makeup accentuating her sharp features, and is dressed in a fitted blouse and jeans. The air is already thick with tension, scattered textbooks hint at a study session gone awry. LAYLA (frustrated) Honestly, Rima, can you be any more stubborn? RIMA (matching Layla's tone) Me, stubborn? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. Layla rolls her eyes as she flips through her notes. Rima clicks her pen incessantly, agitated. LAYLA I'm just saying, maybe if you actually read the material, we wouldn't be arguing about the same point for an hour! RIMA (defensive) I read it, Layla. Maybe if you didn't think you were always right, we could actually study. Layla lets out an exasperated huff and stands up abruptly, causing her chair to scrape loudly against the floor. She opens the fridge and grabs a container of hummus, intending to calm down by eating. LAYLA (sarcastically, while opening the hummus) Oh, great idea. Let's just pretend you know everything. Rima narrows her eyes as Layla scoops a dramatic amount of hummus with a chip and crunches loudly. RIMA (mocking Layla) Yeah, much better to pretend you're always the peaceful one, huh? Layla nearly chokes on her chip, coughing as she slams the hummus container on the table. LAYLA (voice raised) Are you serious right now? RIMA (rising to her feet) As serious as the 'B' you're gonna get if you don't stop being so difficult! Layla looks at the hummus, a mischievous glint in her eye. In a split second, she dips her fingers into the hummus and FLINGS it at Rima. LAYLA (playfully taunting) Difficult enough for you? The gob of hummus lands with a PLOP on Rima’s shirt. Shocked, Rima touches the hummus, looks at it, then at Layla, who is stifling laughter. RIMA (faux outrage turning to amusement) Oh, it is on! Rima grabs a nearby bag of pita bread, and tosses a piece like a frisbee. Layla ducks and the pita hits the wall, leaving a floury mark. The food fight erupts in earnest now. Layla grabs a bottle of olive oil and drizzles it over Rima’s head, causing her hair to stick to her face comically. Rima retaliates by opening a jar of pickles and HURLING them like grenades. LAYLA (laughing hysterically) I didn't know we were in a pickle! RIMA You're gonna be in more than just a pickle! They continue dodging and throwing various items, including olives, tabouleh, and za’atar. As the chaos reaches a climax, Rima stealthily moves toward the fridge and retrieves a big container of labneh. Layla is too busy laughing to notice. RIMA (triumphantly, holding the labneh high) Time for the grand finale, my friend! Layla turns and her eyes widen as she realizes what is about to happen. She tries to negotiate with her arms up in surrender. LAYLA (pleading) Rima, no! It's too late—Rima turns the container upside down, and the creamy labneh cascades over Layla's head, coating her hair and shoulders. LAYLA (spluttering with labneh in her mouth) Okay, okay! Truce! Truce! Rima is doubled over laughing, wiping her eyes, as Layla attempts to flick labneh off her fingers at a hysterical Rima. RIMA (catching her breath) Oh my God, I can't... I can't breathe!

Remember that when you iterate over a file object in a loop using \`for line in gbk\`, Python reads the lines one by one automatically. If you want to read the next line while inside the loop, you can use the \`next()\` built-in function to get the next item from the iterator, which is the file object in this case. Please note that you must handle \`StopIteration\` that will be raised if \`next()\` is called when the file iteration has reached the end. Here is a modified version of your script that captures both coordinates and gene names. It looks ahead for the gene name after finding the coordinates line: \`\`\`python # Initialize an empty list to store the coordinates and gene names gene_info = [] with open(\\"REL606.gbk\\", \\"r\\") as gbk: gbk_iter = iter(gbk) # Create an iterator from the file object for line in gbk_iter: if line.strip().startswith(\\"gene\\") and \\"..\\" in line: coords = line.split()[-1].split(\\"(\\")[-1].split(\\")\\")[0].split(\\"..\\") start = int(coords[0]) end = int(coords[1]) gene_name = None try: while True: # Look ahead to find the gene name next_line = next(gbk_iter) if \\"/gene=\\" in next_line: gene_name = next_line.split(\\"=\\")[1].strip().replace('\\"', '') break except StopIteration: pass # End of file reached # If we found a gene name, store the data as a tuple if gene_name: gene_info.append((start, end, gene_name)) # Print out the collected gene information for info in gene_info: print(info) \`\`\` Make sure you replace \`\\"REL606.gbk\\"\` with the correct path to your file. This script will scan through each line, and upon finding a gene coordinate line, it will capture subsequent lines until it finds one with a gene name, or until it reaches the end of the file. This approach assumes that the gene name always appears on one of the lines immediately following the line that contains the coordinates, which seems to be the case based on your example data.

Restart your Python session to clear out any possible issues with overwritten built-in names. 3. Make sure that you are running the code in a clean environment (for example, a new Jupyter notebook or a new Python script). Also, please ensure that you haven't previously run something like \`next = \\"some string\\"\` or \`next = any_string_variable\` before you execute this block of code.

The characters all end up doing a big \\"NOOOOOO!\\" when suddenly one character notices that there's a big red \\"UNDO\\" button on the paper shredder. The character presses the \\"UNDO\\" button and the paper shredder apologizes and unshreds all the papers and gives them all back to their characters.","completion":"In the heart of Zootopia's bustling precinct, the heat of the overhead fluorescents was only matched by the sizzling friction of pens scribbling furiously on official paperwork. The main room was a maze of desks, each occupied by an animal deep in thought—or deep in the throes of bureaucratic agony. Judy Hopps, the precinct’s first rabbit officer, was buried beneath a pile of reports, her nose twitching with concentration. Beside her, her partner, Nick Wilde, a sly red fox, was filling out his forms with a mixture of boredom and grace. \\"Carrots, how do you keep your writing so neat?\\" Nick asked, his green eyes glinting with a hint of his usual mischief. \\"My pawwriting looks like a chicken trying to do the foxtrot.\\" \\"I practice,\\" Judy answered without looking up, pressing her luck with one ear-bud in, playing Gazelle's latest album to keep her energy up. Just as they were about to call it a day, the precinct door flew open with a bang. In rolled the latest in technological advancements from the ZPD Tech Department—a state-of-the-art paper shredder dubbed the Destructo-Matic 9000. It boasted \\"intuitive use\\" and a promise to \\"destroy documents with ease.\\" Unfortunately, the department was unaware that its intuitive settings were a bit too… antagonistic. Before anyone had a chance to properly introduce themselves to their new office mate, the Destructo-Matic 9000 came to life with a roar not unlike a lion. As the startled officers turned to face the menace, Judy's pile of reports soared into the air and into the shredder's hungry mouth. The room filled with the mechanical grinding of doom—legal statements, case files, doughnut receipts—all chewed into confetti. Even Chief Bogo's prized citation forms were guzzled down mercilessly. \\"Noooooooooo!\\" the entire room wailed in chorus. \\"Not on the day before filing deadline!\\" Nick, who'd just finished applauding the machine's theatrical entrance, paused as his eyes caught a small detail—a bright red \\"UNDO\\" button gleaming on the side of the relentless beast. \\"Stand back, everyone,\\" Nick called out, his smirk returning. \\"I think it's time to test out the manufacturer's return policy.\\" As he pressed the button, the room brimmed with anticipation, a silence filled only by the hum of the machine. Suddenly, the Destructo-Matic 9000’s gears whirred in reverse, and like a magician pulling silks from a hat, it began to regurgitate every last piece of the newly-minted confetti. Out popped each document—case files, citations, even the previously eaten doughnut receipt—restored to their original, dull, un-shredded glory. The officers watched, mouths agape, as the reformed paper shredder coughed out the final sheet, a tiny flag of surrender. \\"I do apologize for my unrestrained consumption,\\" a robotic voice emanated from the Destructo-Matic 9000. \\"Your documents have been unshredded and reassembled. Would you like a staple with that?\\" Laughter erupted through the bullpen, and relief washed over Chief Bogo's face. \\"I think we'll keep you unplugged until we've read the manual,\\" he declared, eyeing the contraption with mild distrust. Nick, grinning, held up a perfectly reconstructed paper form. \\"Hey, Carrots, think this will happen every time I 'accidentally' shred my paperwork?\\" Judy shook her head, tapping a fresh pen against her badge. \\"Don't push your luck, Wilde. But maybe we can keep it around for the next time Bellwether visits.\\" And as the sun set over the glittering skyline of Zootopia, the precinct buzzed with officers diligently returning to their reports—all the while giving the now docile paper shredder a wide berth."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Unfortunately, the film, while visually stunning and punctuated by high-octane action sequences, stumbles with a convoluted plot and a grim tone that might leave even the most ardent fans feeling underwhelmed. The premise is inherently intriguing – the caped crusader, Batman (Ben Affleck), driven by the destruction and chaos Superman (Henry Cavill) brought upon Metropolis in \\"Man of Steel\\", sees the latter as a threat to humanity that must be neutralized. However, the screenplay clumsily handles their ideological clash, often settling for contrived reasons for conflict rather than delving deeper into the characters' psychology and motivations. Affleck surprises as a weary, older Batman, turning in a performance that gives the character a rightfully jaded edge. Cavill's Superman remains as stoic as ever, though the script doesn't afford him much range beyond his furrowed brows of concern. Gal Gadot's debut as Wonder Woman is a highlight, offering a charismatic and mysterious presence that captures the audience's interest in sparse screen time. The inclusion of Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor as the main antagonist adds a manic energy to the proceedings, though his over-the-top portrayal might strike some as jarring when juxtaposed with the film's somber atmosphere. His complicated schemes serve as the catalyst for the titular conflict but often feel unnecessarily convoluted. Visually, the movie is a feast with Snyder's signature style – from the dark, foreboding aesthetic to the larger-than-life action set pieces. The fight choreography is well-executed with a palpable intensity, especially in the one-on-one showdown between Batman and Superman. However, the climactic battle against a CGI adversary is less impressive, succumbing to the typical genre pitfall of a chaotic and bloated spectacle. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL's score is powerful and appropriately epic, yet it can sometimes be too overpowering, making dramatic moments feel overwrought rather than earned. The editing can be jarring, with the film struggling to balance its multiple subplots and characters, leading to a disjointed narrative experience. In its ambition to set up an extended universe for subsequent DC films, \\"Batman v Superman\\" feels overstuffed, as though attempting to play catch-up with its rival Marvel's Cinematic Universe. The result is a movie that sacrifices narrative coherence for franchise groundwork, which ultimately does a disservice to the standalone story it's trying to tell. In conclusion, \\"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\\" may satisfy those hungry for a spectacle of favorite DC characters colliding on the big screen but is likely to disappoint those seeking a cohesive and emotionally resonant cinematic experience. As a chapter in a larger saga, it lays shaky foundations that future installments will either have to reinforce or rebuild entirely. It's a film that, much like its two heroes, is caught in a battle between style and substance, and unfortunately, style largely wins out."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series.

Lina has a mane of curly hair tied into a loose ponytail and wears a Michigan State hoodie with jeans. Marie is slightly shorter, with straightened hair, a U of M sweatshirt, and leggings.* Lina slams her textbook on the kitchen table, papers spilling out to the edges.

COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY The kitchen is small, warmly lit, with a cluttered dining table indicative of college living. There’s an open fridge, half-empty with takeout containers visible. A bag of pita bread lies on the counter next to a bowl of fruit. LAILA (22, dark curly hair, eyebrow piercing, wears a concert t-shirt and ripped jeans) is standing in front of the open fridge, looking for something to eat. Her friend NADINE (21, straightened chestnut hair, wearing a neat blouse with a cardigan, glasses resting on her nose) enters the kitchen holding a textbook. NADINE (cheerful) Shoo, ready for our Sociology mock exam? LAILA (acidly, not turning around) Could be if you hadn’t hogged all the notes. Nadine closes her textbook with a snap, irritation crossing her neatly made-up face. NADINE (defensive) I offered to photocopy them for you, but you wanted to \\"feel the paper.\\" LAILA (turning to face Nadine) Yeah, the paper I never got to feel, Teach. Nadine scoffs, crossing her arms. Laila grabs a container of hummus from the fridge, shaking it, realizing it's nearly empty. NADINE (sarcastic) Oh wow, you could've used the notes to learn about sarcasm. LAILA (scoffing) And you could've used your common sense to remember you're not my only source for study materials! Laila slams the hummus on the counter, agitated. Nadine’s eyes flare. NADINE (almost shouting) Yeah? Because taking mine and not returning them sure says otherwise! They are now face to face. Nadine grabs the pita bread and starts pulling pieces apart, anxiety manifesting in fidgety movements. LAILA (cold) Well, if my success depends on your bread-breaking speed, I’m doomed. (pause, her eyes drift to the bread) Though that would make better study notes right now. Nadine stops tearing the pita, her hurt expressive. NADINE (voice laced with hurt) Ya Laila, that's mean even for you. Laila’s expression softens momentarily, but she’s still on the edge. She goes to dip a chip in the hummus. There's barely enough to coat it. LAILA (frustrated) I mean—look at this! Did you leave any hummus for the rest of us or did you just bathe in it? Nadine snatches the hummus container, a flicker of vindictiveness in her eyes. NADINE If it bothers you so much, ta! Nadine smears a dab of hummus on Laila’s cheek. Laila is taken aback, touching the spot in disbelief. LAILA Oh, it's on. Laila reaches for a bowl of baba ghanoush and flicks a dollop onto Nadine’s forehead with her finger. Nadine gasps, wiping it off. NADINE (screams) Laila! Baba ghanoush? Seriously? This isn’t even funny! LAILA (giggling now) You look like you just got kissed by an eggplant! Nadine, trying to maintain her anger, is fighting off laughter. She grabs a falafel ball and launches it. It bounces off Laila’s shoulder. LAILA (in mock outrage) Sacrilege! You don't weaponize falafel. That's the rule! They look at each other. The tension breaks and they start chuckling, each clutching a container as if preparing for battle. NADINE Okay, truce? No more food weapons? Laila nods, but as Nadine lets her guard down, Laila sneakily grabs a container of labneh. LAILA (faux-innocent tone) Of course, truce— With the declaration, Laila pops the lid off the labneh and dramatically dumps it over Nadine’s head. The thick yogurt plops down, draping Nadine in a cold, creamy mess. NADINE (Now laughing uncontrollably) Oh my God, LAILA! My hair! You’re going to pay for this! Through laughter, Nadine reaches for a tabbouleh salad, eyeing Laila with playful revenge. Laila, now laughing hysterically, throws her hands up in mock surrender. LAILA (evasively) Wait, wait, the tabbouleh is innocent! They freeze, looking at the mess, and then at each other. The absurdity of the situation makes them burst into uncontrollable laughter, echoing around the small kitchen. LAILA (through laughter) We are such children. Look at this place. NADINE Still laughing, wipes labneh from her face with a dishtowel. Let’s never fight again over something as stupid as notes, okay? LAILA (snorting) Deal. Just, let’s clean up before we become part of the actual dirt. They both start to tidy up, still chuckling, occasionally tossing a playful glance at each other. The air is lighter, as if the food fight has washed away the acrimony of their spat.

Bright sunlight streams through the window, casting light on the colorful posters on the wall. On the counter, an assortment of Lebanese groceries. Two women, MAYA and LAYLA, both around 21, are cooking together. MAYA, with curly hair tied in a messy bun, a nose ring, and sporting a crop-top and high-waisted jeans, is vigorously chopping parsley. LAYLA, her hair straight and sleek, framed by sharp glasses, dons an oversized sweater and leggings. MAYA (frustrated) Layla, can you stop bossing me around? I know how to make tabbouleh. LAYLA (calm but condescending) It's just that every single leaf needs to be perfect. It's for the cultural fair, remember? Maya rolls her eyes as Layla examines a tomato like a jeweler inspecting a gem. MAYA God, you sound just like my Teta. Since when are you the tabbouleh police? LAYLA (irritated) Fine, do whatever you want. But when everyone's wondering why our table isn’t popping, I’m blaming you. MAYA (holding up parsley) Rectify my parsley then, Officer Layla. Layla snatches the parsley and starts redoing the chopping. Maya takes a deep breath and focuses on slicing tomatoes, but her knife slips, and a piece of tomato flies off and hits Layla on the cheek. LAYLA (aghast) Seriously, Maya? MAYA (defensive) Whoops. It's not like I did it on purpose. Layla flicks the tomato piece back at Maya, hitting her square on the forehead. MAYA (grinning) Oh, it’s on. Maya picks up a spoonful of hummus and flicks it towards Layla. Layla ducks and the hummus hits the fridge door. LAYLA (scolding) Maya! That’s wasteful! Layla scoops up a bit of baba ghanoush with her finger and smears it on Maya’s arm. MAYA (laughing) Okay, now you’ve crossed a line. A beat as they eye each other, then, like a Western showdown, they both lunge for the bowls of food. Maya grabs a handful of lettuce and tosses it at Layla, some getting caught in her hair. LAYLA (shrieking) Are you kidding me? Layla grabs the olives and plops one at a time towards Maya, who defends herself with the cutting board like a shield. MAYA (helplessly laughing) Truce! Truce! But Layla is not done. In a feigned peace offering, she extends the bowl of labneh towards Maya. LAYLA (coolly) Truce with labneh? Maya, wary, accepts it and takes a breath of relief. However, as she turns away, Layla scoops a dollop of labneh and, quick as lightning, drops it over Maya’s head. It lands with a comical plop, sliding down into her curly locks. MAYA (flabbergasted) Did you just… You labneh'd me? LAYLA (barely holding back laughter) I did warn you. Maya touches the white goop in her hair, a mix of disbelief and humor in her eyes. She shakes her head, sending little specks of labneh flying. MAYA (chunk of labneh in hand) It’s the cultural fair, huh? Wait till I tell everyone the Labneh Queen crowned me herself. Layla loses her composure, laughing uncontrollably, and Maya can’t help but join in. They both end up in a fit of giggles, standing amidst the messy battlefield of their kitchen. MAYA (still laughing) You're cleaning this up, by the way. LAYLA (wiping tears of laughter) Like hell I am! Partners in crime, partners in grime. The laughter fades into comfortable silence as they start cleaning up together, still occasionally snorting with residual chuckles.

KITCHEN - LEBANESE-AMERICAN COLLEGE APARTMENT - DAY The sun filters through a vibrant tapestry hanging in front of a window, casting colorful shadows on the kitchen where LAILA (21, long, wavy brown hair, energetic eyes, wearing an AUB sweatshirt) and NADIA (22, pixie-cut brunette, sharp features, nose stud, in a graphic tee and jeans) are preparing brunch. The kitchen is cozy, filled with the aroma of garlic and mint, and decorated with a mix of American and Lebanese touches. Laila chops tomatoes vigorously while Nadia flips manakish in a cast-iron skillet. Both women dance to the rhythmic beats of Lebanese pop music playing in the background. LAILA Gosh, I could marry za'atar, swear to God. NADIA (cheekily) Too bad it won't keep you warm at night, habibti. Laila mock gasps and tosses a diced tomato in Nadia's direction; it hits her shoulder and bounces off. LAILA You'd be surprised! NADIA (brushing off the tomato) Hey, hold up! We're not making a salad outta my clothes! A beat. They exchange playful glances, a moment of silent challenge. The music seems to drop low, teasing the confrontation. LAILA (mischievously) What's the matter, Nad? Can't handle a little tomato? Laila flicks a piece of mint at Nadia. It sticks to her forehead. The air is thick with the scent of fresh dough and competition. NADIA (wiping her forehead) Alright, yallah, you asked for it! Nadia retaliates. She grabs a handful of olives and tosses them. They scatter, pinging off pots and pans. LAILA (dodging) Ha! Your aim is as bad as your tabbouleh! Nadia feigns offense, then she snaps a dishtowel in the air and swings it at Laila. It cracks like a whip. NADIA Take that back! LAILA (smirking) Make me, Ms. No-Parsley! The olives are forgotten in favor of the dishtowel duel. Laila grabs another, swinging in defense. Towels snap in air like a choreographed dance. The skillet sizzles ignored on the stove. NADIA It’s called \\"innovation\\" in the kitchen! LAILA (laughs) More like an abomination! Nadia's smile fades and her eyes harden. She reaches for the labneh, the cool, thick yogurt-like cream planned for the brunch finale. A loaded weapon. A line in the sand. NADIA (seriously) Don't make me use this. Laila hesitates, her dishtowel held mid-swing. She's not laughing anymore. They lock eyes, both betting on the other's bluff. LAILA (low) You wouldn't. The pop music pulses, urging on the absurdity, willing them to take it to the next level. NADIA (with a firm nod) Oh, I would. In one fluid motion, Nadia scoops a majestic dollop of labneh and lobs it directly at Laila. However, Laila ducks, and the labneh hits the window with a splat before sliding down the tapestry. LAILA (furious and defiant) That's it! Laila lunges for the discarded skillet, which contains a few crispy edges of manakish, and turns toward Nadia. NADIA (screams) Wait, Laila— Don't! But Laila is a woman possessed. She scrapes the crispy remains onto Nadia’s head, the oily bits sticking to her hair. NADIA (spluttering) This is war, Laila! Laila, realizing she went too far, steps back, skillet in hand. Both women are breathing heavily, covered in stray bits of brunch. The room is silent except for the background pop music, a stark contrast to their heavy breaths. LAILA (contrite) Oh my God, Nad... I'm— NADIA (interrupting, mortified) I can't believe you put manakish in my hair. They burst into uncontrollable laughter despite the sticky mess, Nadia trying to pull pieces from her hair. Laila sets the skillet down and walks over to her friend with a sheepish smile. The tension dissipates as they attempt to clean themselves up, their laughter echoing in the kitchen. LAILA Sorry, yani, I swear it was the war spirit! NADIA (shaking her head but smiling) You owe me big time. A full spa day, on you. LAILA (pretending to salute) Yes, General Nadia! Whatever you say! They lean against each other, grinning, hearts light despite the disaster area they've created. The pop music swells, a fitting backdrop to the end of their culinary battle.

ANNA AND SAMIRA’S COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY Anna, 23, with wavy dark hair and expertly done cat-eye makeup, stands at the kitchen counter chopping vegetables. Beside her, Samira, also 23, with thick, curly hair and a nose stud, is spreading labneh on pita bread. The room is a cozy, student apartment kitchen with posters on the walls, pots hanging from a rack, and a fridge covered in magnets and to-do lists. The air is filled with the aroma of spices. ANNA (Oblivious to Samira’s work) Babe, did you remember to pick up the extra pita from the store? I invited John and his buddies for dinner. Samira’s hand freezes mid-spread, her expression shifting to annoyance. SAMIRA You did what now? Anna, we discussed this. I have that online interview tonight, remember? ANNA (Rolling her eyes) Your interviews are like, never even loud. What’s the big deal? SAMIRA (Starting to raise her voice) The big deal? I need this place to be QUIET. For once, could you not think about your social life? ANNA (Smirking) Uh-oh, someone’s hangry. Eat some labneh, it’ll fix your mood. Anna playfully flicks a piece of bell pepper at Samira. It breezes past her and lands on the floor. SAMIRA (Scoffing) Real mature. You think you can just do whatever because you’re... Stung by the comment, Anna cuts her off. ANNA Because I’m what, Samira? Samira’s face turns red, a pinch of defensiveness edging into her tone. SAMIRA You always pull the spoiled princess card, expecting everyone to bend over backwards. Anna grabs a slice of cucumber, scoffs, and in a moment of peak irritation, throws it at Samira. It lightly taps Samira’s shoulder. ANNA (Feigning shock) Oh, I am so sorry, Your Majesty. Did I upset the queen? Samira picks up a small handful of softened chickpeas from the countertop and tosses them back at Anna. They bounce off her forearm. SAMIRA (Chuckles sarcastically) Oops, butterfingers! The tension breaks a little with a begrudging smirk from Anna. ANNA Okay, truce. I’ll cancel with John. Anna extends her hand, but Samira, still wound up, ignores it and takes a scoop of tabbouleh. SAMIRA Fine, but you owe me silence tonight. She offers the tabbouleh to Anna, pretending to make peace. As Anna reaches to accept, Samira smooshes it onto Anna’s hand instead. ANNA (Gasping with playful anger) Oh, it’s on! Anna lunges for a container of hummus, but Samira is faster. She grabs the yogurt-like labneh, and in a measured escalation, they encircle the island counter, each armed and ready. ANNA (Warningly) You wouldn’t dare. SAMIRA (Taunting) Oh, I would. In a moment of hesitation, they both laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation but their eyes remain locked in a mock standoff. Suddenly, Anna feints with the hummus, prompting Samira to duck and move in with the labneh. With comedic precision, she upends the bowl, and the white labneh blobs comically onto Anna’s head, complete with a splat. Anna stands there, stunned, mouth agape, as Samira drops the bowl and clutches her stomach in laughter. ANNA (Pointing at Samira in disbelief) You did not just labneh my hair. SAMIRA (Giggling uncontrollably) I can’t believe you just stood there! Anna can’t help but start laughing too. The tension diffuses rapidly as the absurdity sets in. ANNA (Catching her breath) Fine. You got me. But you’re cleaning this mess up. SAMIRA (Still chuckling) Deal! But first, let's take a selfie with your new hairdo.

The probability of encountering graphing problems and their specific formats/questions can vary depending on the curriculum, the teacher's preferences, and the set of questions prepared for the exam. However, if you have encountered similar types of questions in your pre-calculus class or if your teacher has given you guidance on what topics will be covered on the exam, you can make an educated guess based on your experience. For instance, if graphing problems have been a common topic in class and your teacher has mentioned that it will be part of the exam, then the probability of encountering a graph-to-equation matching question would likely be higher. Ultimately, without more specific information about your exam and classroom context, it is not possible to determine the exact odds of encountering this type of question. It is best to review a diverse set of topics and practice various types of questions to be prepared for any possibility."},{"prompt":"no forget the odds, do you think that my teacher would have those types of problems on the exam?","completion":"As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific information about your teacher's preferences or the content of your exam. The decision of which types of problems to include in an exam is ultimately up to your teacher. However, graphing problems, including matching graphs to equations, are common topics in pre-calculus. It is possible that your teacher may include such problems on the exam. To increase your chances of success, it is recommended to review and practice a wide range of topics, including graphing and equation matching. This will help you feel confident and prepared for any type of question that may be included on the exam. Additionally, if you are unsure about the exam's content, you can reach out to your teacher for clarification or reference previous class materials to get a better understanding."},{"prompt":"given the function g(x) = 1/2|x-2| -3, and f(x)=|x|, use function notation to write g in terms of x.","completion":"To write the function g(x) = 1/2|x-2| - 3 in terms of x using function notation, you would express it as g(x) = 1/2 * |x-2| - 3. This notation shows that the function g(x) depends on the variable x and is defined as the expression 1/2 * |x-2| - 3."},{"prompt":"State the number of complex zeros, the possible number of real and imaginary zeros, and the possible rational zeros for each function. Then find all zeros. x^3-13x^2+23x-11","completion":"To determine the number of complex zeros, possible real and imaginary zeros, and possible rational zeros for the given function f(x) = x^3 - 13x^2 + 23x - 11, we will apply the Rational Root Theorem. According to the Rational Root Theorem, if a polynomial with integer coefficients, like f(x), has a rational zero p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient, then p is among the factors of the constant term (-11) and q is among the factors of the leading coefficient (1). Factors of -11: ±1, ±11 Factors of 1: ±1 Possible rational zeros: ±1, ±11 Now, let's find all the zeros of the polynomial function using possible rational zeros: For x = 1: f(1) = (1)^3 - 13(1)^2 + 23(1) - 11 = 0 Therefore, x = 1 is a zero of f(x). For x = -1: f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 13(-1)^2 + 23(-1) - 11 = -1 + 13 - 23 - 11 = -22 Therefore, x = -1 is not a zero of f(x). For x = 11: f(11) = (11)^3 - 13(11)^2 + 23(11) - 11 = 1331 - 1573 + 253 - 11 = 0 Therefore, x = 11 is a zero of f(x). For x = -11: f(-11) = (-11)^3 - 13(-11)^2 + 23(-11) - 11 = -1331 - 1573 - 253 - 11 = -3168 Therefore, x = -11 is not a zero of f(x). So, the zeros of the polynomial function f(x) = x^3 - 13x^2 + 23x - 11 are x = 1 and x = 11. Since the degree of the polynomial is 3 (odd), there is an odd number of complex zeros. As we have found all the zeros, we can conclude that there is only one complex zero. The remaining zero(s) must also be complex."},{"prompt":"predict w/o solving first","completion":"Without solving the equation, we can make some predictions about the number of complex zeros, possible real and imaginary zeros, and possible rational zeros based on the given function f(x) = x^3 - 13x^2 + 23x - 11. 1. Number of complex zeros: The degree of the polynomial is 3, which means there can be at most 3 complex zeros. However, there might be fewer or none at all. 2. Possible real and imaginary zeros: Since the coefficients of the polynomial are all real numbers, there can be either real zeros or complex zeros in which the imaginary part is zero. In other words, all zeros will be either real numbers or complex numbers with zero imaginary parts. 3. Possible rational zeros: According to the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational zeros are factors of the constant term (-11) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1). In this case, the possible rational zeros are ±1 and ±11. These predictions are based on the properties of polynomial functions and the Rational Root Theorem. However, to determine the actual zeros, the polynomial equation needs to be solved either analytically or numerically."},{"prompt":"how do I solve this problem: The following equilibrium constants were determined at 1123K: C(s) + CO2(g) ⇌2CO(g) Kc = 1.4 x 1012 CO(g) + Cl2(g) ⇌COCl2(g) Kc= 5.5 x 10-1 What is the value of Kc and Kp for the following reaction?

UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA – DAY Close on a plastic container of LABNEH sitting on a crowded cafeteria table littered with textbooks, scattered notes, and two half-eaten falafel sandwiches. We pan up to the faces of LAILA and MARIAM, both Lebanese American college seniors, engrossed in a study session. Laila has her curly hair tied back in a ponytail, round glasses perched on her nose, and wears a comfortable sweatshirt with a university logo. Mariam is more made-up, her straightened hair framing her face, accessorized with hoop earrings, wearing a stylish blouse. LAILA (annoyed) No, Mariam.

MARIAM (mimicking) ‘Oh look at me, I'm Laila, I plan everything down to when I sneeze.’ LAILA (sarcastic) Ha-ha. Very funny. A beat of silence falls over them as their smirks fade and their breaths seethe. The silence is thick with growing acrimony. MARIAM (voice raising) You think you're better than me? LAILA (countering) I never said that! MARIAM (snide) You didn't have to. Your attitude speaks for itself. LAILA (clenching her jaw) You're so— oh, what's the word? Oh, yeah — impossible!

And I'm here to solve-a your problem!\\" Both groups looked up to see the iconic video game plumber suspended in the air, riding some sort of cloud kart that somehow had room for his Italian brother too. From beneath his green cap, Luigi pulled out a pile of Nintendo DS consoles and Mario Kart DS cartridges, which parachuted down amidst the stunned crowd. \\"The team that-a does the better in Mario Kart gets the rock!\\" Luigi declared, presumably home from a plumbing job in another universe. The animals from both Zootopia and the Moon Theater looked at each other, then at the gaming devices, then back to the sky, only to see Luigi and Mario zoom away with a hearty, \\"Mamma Mia!\\" Shrugging, they each grabbed a console and gathered in a semi-circle. Judy paired with Nick, Rosita with Gunter, Meena with Johnny, and Mike with Ash. \\"Rev up your engines!\\" Nick smirked. \\"Showtime!\\" cheered Buster. The friendly rivalry heated up as the game began. Hooves, paws, and claws raced across tiny buttons as the electronic beeps and boops of Mario Kart DS filled the air. Turtles were thrown, bananas were slipped on, and stars made players invincible. As they played, the real-time competition and quite actual screams of delight and frustration echoed throughout the field. As it turned out, the characters from both Zootopia and Sing were Mario Kart naturals, but nobody could touch Meena's lightning reflexes, not even Judy’s quick paws. Finally, as the digital checkered flag waved, Meena crossed the finish line for the win. Cheers erupted from both sides because, let's face it, they were all too amused by the sheer ridiculousness of the situation to keep arguing. As the sun set on their impromptu gaming tournament, the groups realized something. The rock might have brought them together under absurd circumstances, but friendships were formed on that virtual racetrack. \\"Alright, Moon Theater gets the rock,\\" Judy admitted, chuckling. \\"But we get to visit for every show!\\" \\"Deal!\\" exclaimed Buster, as they all laughed, shared a group high-five, and huddled around the rock, which now felt much cooler in more ways than one. And so the day ended not with decisive ownership of the rock, but with an even better discovery: a new shared experience and the promise of intense Mario Kart rematches in the future. Not a bad outcome for a field trip gone unexpectedly wild."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series.

COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY The small, yet homey kitchen is adorned with posters of Lebanese pop stars and the unmistakable aroma of za'atar. SUN-RAYS filter through the window, illuminating the specks of flour in the air. LARA (25, Lebanese-American, long wavy black hair, casual chic with an edge of hipster) stands sorting through vegetables, preparing to cook. She wears black-framed glasses, which slip down her nose occasionally. NADIA (25, Lebanese-American, short curly hair, athletic build, dressed in a university sweatshirt and jeans) sits at a small table littered with textbooks and a laptop, her brows furrowed in concentration. LARA (Trying to break the silence) Shu, Nadia? What are you studying so seriously? NADIA (Without looking up) Psych. Final tomorrow. And it’s “studyin’”, la'ish adding the 'g' kteer? LARA (Rolling her eyes mockingly) Bas, vernacular can be fun, no? Alright, ya ‘Miss Studyin’, is there a chapter on how to decode friends? NADIA (Takes off her glasses, looks at Lara) Friends, ha? Speaking of decoding friends... I still can’t believe you went out with Tony last night. LARA (Defensive) What's the big deal? You know we've been texting. NADIA Plays with her glasses, frustrated Shu 'texting'? Tony is a player. And you’re supposedly my best friend. LARA (Putting down a cucumber) Oh, we’re playing the loyalty card now? He’s not your ex; you guys went on what... two dates? NADIA (Itching to stand) But you know there was more to it! And for the record, it was three dates! A BEAT passes as they both simmer, NADIA’s hands clench. LARA (Oblivious to Nadia’s temper) Tab, listen. You broke it off. Plus, it’s not like you to cling to a guy... especially not Tony. NADIA (Tension rising) This isn’t about clinging. It’s about you hopping on every guy I show a slight interest in. LARA (Surprised and hurt) Shu yaani, Nadia?! That’s a pretty heavy accusation. This isn’t about Tony, is it? NADIA (Closer to boiling point) Of course, it is! And it's about you acting like you're single when you’re not! LARA (Upset and moving towards the fridge) Oh, khalas. Now we’re bringing up Ziad? This is nonsense! NADIA Pacing now Liar! You’re sneaking around, and our friendship is just a game to you! SILENCE hangs heavily in the air. LARA, visibly shocked by NADIA’s words, slams the fridge door and turns around. Her hand dives into a container and emerges with a dollop of LABNEH. LARA (With a mix of hurt and anger) Here’s what I think of your accusation! LARA strides with determination and splats the LABNEH resolutely on NADIA’s head, globs of it sliding down her hair and face. NADIA sits frozen, LABNEH dripping. NADIA (Stunned, barely a whisper) You did not just… LARA (Breathing heavily, a sliver of regret) I… I… NADIA’s face contorts from shock to a poorly suppressed snicker. LARA’s posture softens as she sees NADIA struggling to remain serious. NADIA (Giggling amidst the mess) This is so stupid... look at us! LARA (Contagiously beginning to smile) I’m sorry... It’s said Labneh does wonders for the skin, though. NADIA (Laughing) I’ll tell my mom this is the new ‘Lebanese facial’. They both burst into uncontrolled laughter. NADIA finally stands, extending her arms for a hug, forgetting the LABNEH. LARA hesitates, then hugs NADIA back, both laughing and squishing the labneh between them, a mixture of mirth and dairy uniting them.

Students are buzzing around them, their chattering a constant hum in the background. Layla is trying to study, her textbooks sprawled across the table, while Rima is picking at a container of labneh, tearing pieces from a pita bread. RIMA (rolling her eyes) I swear, if Professor Harb drags on about quantum physics one more time, I'm going to lose it. LAYLA (shushing) Keep it down, will you? And it’s important for your degree, unless you’ve got a plan to charm your way through life. Rima scoffs, chuckling. RIMA Layla, I've got more plans than you've got hijabs. Besides, speaking of charming, heard anything from Mr. Cute Smile from the chem lab? Layla blushes, glancing down at her book to conceal her smile. LAYLA (sarcastically) Oh, you mean Robert? Yeah, we’re eloping tomorrow. Thought you’d be my maid of honor. RIMA (teasing) It's 'cause I’d make the prettiest one, right? They both laugh before a sudden serious look passes Layla’s face.

The cafeteria quiets down around them, curious eyes turn towards the unfolding drama. Layla, seething, glances at the white container of labneh in front of Rima.

The extensive extraction of fossil fuels such as natural gas, petroleum, coal and oil has led to the increased emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a primary contributor to global warming and climate change [1]. Thus, efficiently converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is crucial for mitigating the negative impacts of CO2 emission. Among the various strategies available, photocatalytic CO2 reduction has attracted significant interest due to its environmental friendliness [2]. As a result, considerable efforts have been directed towards developing high-performance photocatalysts to improve the rate of CO2 conversion [3]. Specifically, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are increasingly regarded as potential materials because of their large specific surface area, high porosity and abundant accessible active sites [4].

APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY A medium-sized kitchen bathed in the warm light of a late afternoon sun. The room smells of spices and coffee. Stacks of textbooks and notebooks clutter the small kitchen table. LARA (23, Lebanese American, wavy black hair tied back in a messy bun, wearing jeans and a graphic tee) stands at the counter slicing cucumbers with methodical precision, her brow furrowing in concentration. She’s clearly trying to keep her temper in check. Her friend, NOURA (22, Lebanese American, slightly taller, with stylishly cut short brown hair, sporting a band tee and leggings), is searching the fridge, humming an off-key tune, taking out ingredients. She takes out a tub of labneh, checking its consistency. The setting is intimate, with photos of the girls and their friends plastered on the fridge, a string of fairy lights adorning the window. NOURA (scoffing) Ya haram ya Lara. Why do you put so much pressure on yourself with these sandwiches? It's just veggies. LARA (focused, dismissive) It's about balance, Noura. A good sandwich is like... life. You need to handle it with care. NOURA (snickers) Philosophical much? Over a sandwich? You're killing me, babe. Noura scoops some labneh onto a clean spoon and licks it, appearing thoughtful. LARA (suddenly serious) Speaking of killing... we need to talk about that Econ paper. NOURA (defensive) What about it? LARA (turning to face Noura) You basically copied my entire framework. I mean, come on, \\"The economic implications of hummus export\\"? That was my topic! NOURA (rolling eyes) Hello? We are Lebanese. Hummus runs in our veins. Your topic? Please! LARA (gesticulating, cucumber in hand) It's called academic integrity, Noura. You could at least have tweaked it a bit! NOURA (leaning on the counter) Tweaked? Lara, why are you making such a big deal out of this? Everyone takes 'inspiration' from everyone in college. LARA (puts the cucumber down, more agitated) Inspiration is different than straight up copying, Noura! You didn’t even change the case studies! NOURA (raising her voice) It's not like I had time to come up with anything else! Plus, you know I’m not a nerd like you. LARA (steps closer, offended) Nerd? Really? Just because I care about my education? Noura laughs sarcastically, clearly hitting a nerve. NOURA Oh, come on. I meant it in the nicest way possible. You are just too sensitive! LARA (angered, voice raising) Too sensitive? I can't believe you sometimes. Noura slams the tub of labneh on the counter, looking for a way to end this. NOURA (changes subject) Fine, forget I said anything. What are we watching tonight? LARA (sarcastically) Something with 'nerds' in it, I guess. So you can find new ways to mock me. NOURA (turning back to the fridge, frustrated) Ya Allah, I was kidding! You never take a joke! LARA (crossing her arms) There's a thin line between a joke and an insult, Noura.

LARA Yalla, tell me, how is my wanting you to not be academically dishonest crossing any line? NOURA (reaching her boiling point) Because you’re not my mother, Lara! Lara is now fuming, and without realizing, her hand brushes the counter, accidentally knocking over a container of za’atar. LARA (in Lebanese Arabic, exasperated) Yaretik! Look what you made me do!

Kul shi bas except food! NOURA (bursts out laughing, can't hold the facade) I’m sorry, but you... covered in labneh is just... (laughs) I can’t! The sound of Noura’s laughter fills the kitchen. Lara wipes off some of the labneh from her face, unable to fully stifle a growing smirk amidst her exasperation. LARA (smirking, wiping off labneh) I swear, I’m going to get you back for this.

COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY The scene opens in a warmly lit, somewhat cluttered kitchen of a college apartment. Two Lebanese American college seniors, LAYLA and NADIA, both in their early 20s, are present. LAYLA has wild, curly hair tied back in a bun, donning a graphic tee and ripped jeans. She’s got a nose ring and several bracelets jangling on her wrist. NADIA, on the other hand, has sleek, long dark hair, sharp features, and is wearing a stylish blouse with high-waisted pants. Both appear to be under the stress of the impending finals. They are standing on either side of an island kitchen counter, a variety of groceries spread between them. Sunlight filters through a window, crowning their heads with a subtle halo. LAYLA (Throwing a bag of pita bread on the counter) Okay, so we’re agreed on making fatteh for the potluck, right? NADIA (Checking her phone) Yes, Layla. For the hundredth time, yes. Can’t screw this up. They begin to organize ingredients, and the banter is friendly at first, but the stress is palpable. LAYLA (Holding up a cucumber) Look, if we’re gonna do this, we gotta do it right. I don’t want anyone saying it’s not authentic. NADIA Dude, chill. It's just a college potluck. Besides, who here would know the difference? LAYLA (Gesturing expressively) Ah, but that’s the point! They need to taste the homeland, feel the Mediterranean breeze in every bite! NADIA (Smirking) Right, Layla. Because nothing says ‘Mediterranean breeze’ quite like the Midwest in April. LAYLA (Rolling her eyes) You know what I mean. As they continue preparing ingredients, the light-hearted mood begins to sour. Layla opens a container of labneh to taste it. NADIA (Beckoning over) Hey, pass the labneh when you're done. I'll mix in the garlic. LAYLA (Tasting it) No, wait. This labneh seems... off. NADIA (Grabbing the container) What? No way, let me see. Nadia dips a finger in and tastes it. Immediately, her face tightens with disagreement. NADIA (Defensive) What are you talking about? It's fine. LAYLA (Insistent) It’s not tart enough. And the texture is all wrong... This won't do. NADIA (Annoyed) Seriously, it's labneh. You're being ridiculous. LAYLA (Firmly) We’re not using subpar labneh. I’d rather die of shame. NADIA (Tossing her hands up) Oh, for God's sake, Layla. This is why no one wants to cook with you! LAYLA takes a step back, affronted. LAYLA (Wounded) What’s that supposed to mean? NADIA (Exasperated) You turn everything into a big drama! It’s labneh, not a national crisis. Their gestures become more animated as they argue, and their voices escalate. LAYLA (Eyes flaring) Well, excuse me for caring about our culture! NADIA (Cutting in) Oh, please. You just like to control everything! LAYLA (Accusingly) And you’re so laid back, everything turns to sh*t! The argument becomes a fierce, back-and-forth bickering match. NADIA (Throwing her arms up) I can’t even with you right now! LAYLA (Gritting her teeth) Fine! In a moment of heated fury, LAYLA grabs the container of labneh and upends it over NADIA’s head. The white, creamy cheese cascades down like a bizarre, slow-motion baptism. Nadia's sleek hair and stylish outfit become a mess, and she stands there in shock. NADIA (In utter disbelief) ...Did you just...? LAYLA (Breathless, realizing the absurdity) Oh my god. Nadia, I... NADIA (Coldly, dripping with labneh) You're dead, Layla. A beat of silence follows, where they just stare at each other. Then, suddenly, both of them break into uncontrollable laughter, the tension diffusing into the absurdity of the moment. LAYLA (Trying to speak through laughs) I can't even look at you. NADIA (Laughing and wiping labneh off) We are never doing this again. They continue laughing, attempting to clean up the mess. Despite the mishap, their friendship is clearly resilient enough to withstand even the most ludicrous of fights. LAYLA (Giggling) So, takeout for the potluck? NADIA As if there’s any other option. They share a knowing look and nod, their laughter subsiding as they start to pick up the container and other scattered items, their comradeship restored in shared absurdity.

However, for your request, we can create a plausible and non-erotic alternate history timeline that maintains respect for historical figures and cultures, and that is consistent with the framework established by the Hyakka Ryouran franchise, which blends elements of fantasy with historical Japanese figures and events. Alternate History Timeline: 1392: - Yi Seong-gye, a half-Han Chinese Korean military commander, overthrows the Japanese province of Kutara, which ruled over the Korean Peninsula, and establishes the Dae Joseon-gug as a tributary state of the Great Ming dynasty (Dà Míngguō). 1585: - The rise of the Dai Nihon Teikoku Bakufu led by the Toyotomi clan as absolute military rulers of Japan. They establish an aggressive foreign policy that aspires to expand Japan's territories. 1592: - The Imjin Wars begin with Japan's invasion of Korea. The Dai Nihon Teikoku Bakufu, led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, aims to control the Korean Peninsula and eventually attack the Ming dynasty itself. 1598: - The assassination of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, orchestrated by a member of the Korean yangban class, means that the Joseon Navy, particularly the elite Haebyeong unit, is unable to repel the Japanese invasion effectively. 1603: - Toyotomi Hideyoshi's death leads to the slow dissolution of the Dai Nihon Teikoku Bakufu. However, the chaos in Korea allows smaller Japanese fiefdoms to hold on to parts of the Korean Peninsula. 1615: - The Tokugawa shogunate is established by Tokugawa Ieyasu and consolidates control over all of Japan, including the Korean territories held since the Imjin Wars. The Tokugawa shogunate introduces policies aimed at assimilating the Korean populace within these territories. 1644: - Collapse of the Ming dynasty and the rise of the Qing dynasty. The Tokugawa shogunate manages to retain control over the conquered Korean territories by playing a delicate diplomatic game with the new Qing dynasty, acknowledging their rule while keeping a firm grip on the peninsula. 1802: - The presence of Master Samurai, young women with immense psychic and magical powers that strengthen their combat abilities, becomes more common. They start to play a key role in both domestic politics and military campaigns. 1868: - The Tokugawa shogunate faces internal pressure to modernize, partly driven by the technological prowess demonstrated by Master Samurai. Despite this, they retain power by skillfully navigating both domestic and international politics, unlike in our real history. 1911: - The Xinhai Revolution occurs, leading to the fall of the Qing dynasty. The Tokugawa shogunate, now a regional power, uses its influence and military might, including Master Samurai, to support the restoration of the Ming dynasty's rule over China. 1949: - Post World War II, the new geopolitical landscape leads to the rise of the State of Vietnam. Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate remains a formidable power, in part because of the Master Samurai who are influential in both military and political spheres. 1955: - In a modernizing East Asia, the integration of Korea into Japan is complete. The cultural assimilation of Korean people into the greater Japanese nation is recognized, with the Master Samurai seen as protectors of the realm and symbols of national strength. Through this timeline, the Master Samurai form an integral part of the military and political fabric of the Tokugawa shogunate, helping shape the course of East Asian history while maintaining peace and order within the realm. This fictional version of history shows how the presence of these powerful individuals would have potentially influenced the balance of power in the region."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Avoid direct imitation but consider Alyx's hallmark features—her practicality, resourcefulness, and distinctive style. Opt for functional attire tailored to the game's world, which might include cargo pants, a utility belt, and sensible boots, echoing Alyx's readiness for action without copying her exact outfit. 2. **Personality**: Alyx is known for her intelligence, bravery, and compassion. Develop a character with a similarly strong but approachable personality. She should be someone who can form genuine connections with other characters and show both vulnerability and strength. 3. **Skills**: Like Alyx, your heroine could be technologically savvy or mechanically inclined, showing proficiency in hacking, engineering, or piloting. However, be sure to give her a unique set of skills that are relevant to your game's narrative and mechanics. 4. **Backstory**: Give her a compelling backstory that influences her motivations and actions within the game. It should be distinct from Alyx's story but can still embody elements of personal loss, survival, or a fight against oppression. 5. **Voice Acting**: The voice of your character should convey emotion and depth, similar to how Alyx's voice actor brought her to life. Yet, the voice should match your character's original backstory and personality. 6. **Animation and Movement**: Alyx is known for her fluid animations that conveyed a sense of humanity. Ensure your character has natural movements that reflect her agility and expertise without directly copying Alyx's animation set. 7. **Companion Dynamics**: One of the defining elements of Alyx Vance is her relationship with the protagonist, Gordon Freeman. Your new character could have her own unique relationships that highlight her ability to work in a team, her loyalty, or her tendency to form strong bonds with others. 8. **Growth and Development**: Throughout the Half-Life series, Alyx grows and adapts to the world's changing circumstances. Your character should also have a story arc that allows for character development and shows her overcoming challenges. 9. **Morality and Decision-Making**: Alyx is often faced with tough decisions that reflect her moral compass. Integrate situations where your character must make decisions that affect the game's outcome, further developing her personality. 10. **Unique Traits**: Finally, give her a distinguishing trait or hobby that sets her apart and adds to her depth. It could be an interest in a particular area of science, a knack for improvising gadgets, or a unique sense of humor. By taking these elements and weaving them through your game's narrative and mechanics, you can create a heroine with echoes of Alyx Vance while establishing a character who stands on her own in your sci-fi universe. This will allow players to relate to your new character through the lens of nostalgia without feeling like they're experiencing a carbon copy."},{"prompt":"Making the heroine Blasian could help too, right?","completion":"Absolutely, making the heroine of Blasian (Black and Asian) descent can contribute to creating a distinct and memorable character while honoring the diversity that is increasingly expected and appreciated by contemporary gaming audiences. In addition to creating a nuanced character identity, it can help address representation by bringing diverse perspectives to the genre. Here's how making your heroine Blasian can work effectively: 1. **Cultural Background**: Blend aspects of Black and Asian heritage into the character's backstory, beliefs, and practices. This can add depth to the character and create opportunities for unique storytelling. 2. **Visual Design**: Design your character in a way that accurately and respectfully reflects her Blasian heritage, being mindful to represent her features, hair, and skin tone in a way that is authentic and avoids stereotypes. 3. **Character Experiences**: Consider how her Blasian identity may have shaped her experiences within the game's world. Explore themes of identity, acceptance, and resilience, which can resonate with many players and add layers of depth to the narrative. 4. **Community Relations**: Reflect on how she interacts with different communities and cultures within the game. Her mixed heritage could play a role in how she's perceived by others and how she navigates social dynamics. 5. **Voice Acting**: Choose a voice actor who can genuinely represent the character's diverse background and bring authenticity to the role. 6. **Storytelling**: Incorporate elements of her heritage into the storyline in a way that is natural and relevant. Consider using cultural references, folklore, or language snippets that enrich the world-building and character development. 7. **Avoiding Stereotypes**: Be mindful of not reducing your character to her racial background. Her heritage should be one of many aspects that make up her multifaceted character. 8. **Consultation and Research**: To ensure accurate and respectful representation, consult with people of Blasian heritage and conduct thorough research. This will help create a more authentic character and can enrich the game's development process. In terms of gameplay and character development, being Blasian should not be the sole defining aspect of your heroine. It's crucial that she is well-rounded, with her own ambitions, fears, and personality traits that make her relatable and compelling regardless of her racial background. By creating a multifaceted character whose Blasian identity is one of many dimensions, you can avoid tokenism and ensure that she stands out as an individual in her own right."},{"prompt":"I meant because Alyx is too.","completion":"I see, you're referencing the fact that Alyx Vance is often perceived as a character of mixed heritage, possibly Black and Asian, due to her character design in the Half-Life series. Yes, creating a heroine who is Blasian could indeed nod to Alyx Vance's character without being overtly derivative, as long as the homage is subtle and the character is given her own unique identity within your game's narrative. When drawing inspiration from Alyx: - **Visual homage**: Pay subtle homage to Alyx’s visual design by incorporating elements that may be recognized by fans but still contribute to your character's unique visual identity. Features that reflect a blended heritage without directly copying Alyx's appearance can create that sense of familiarity while still being original. - **Independent character development**: Ensure your character has her unique traits, backstory, and role within the game. The character should not feel like a reskin of Alyx, but rather a fully thought-out individual whose personality and story stand on their own. - **Diverse team**: To enhance the authenticity of the character's portrayal and avoid stereotypes, it is beneficial to involve creators and voice actors from diverse backgrounds in the development process, particularly those who share the character’s heritage. - **Cultural sensitivity**: Be respectful and avoid clichés or tokenistic approaches when developing the character’s cultural background. The aim is to create a genuine representation that players can connect with, regardless of their own background. - **Voice Acting and Performance**: Hire a voice actor who can bring depth to the character, someone who can reflect the character's mixed heritage in a way that respects the diversity the character is meant to represent. Remember, the goal is to create a character that is familiar enough to evoke nostalgia but original enough to stand on her own merits in your game world. Balancing these elements will help establish her as a memorable and distinct character apart from Alyx Vance, while still paying homage to the trailblazing character that influenced her creation."},{"prompt":"How could I not try too hard to make her likeable? List some examples of trying to hard as well.","completion":"Creating a likable character without trying too hard involves crafting a genuine, relatable protagonist with strengths and flaws, rather than enforcing likability through unnatural dialogue, forced humor, or contrived situations. Here are some guidelines to achieve a natural charm and likability in your heroine: # Ways to Create a Likable Character Without Trying Too Hard: 1. **Flawed yet Relatable**: Give your character realistic flaws and insecurities that players can empathize with. This makes her more human and approachable. 2. **Genuine Interactions**: Let her form natural relationships with other characters. Authentic interactions, including moments of vulnerability, can endear her to players. 3. **Consistent Motivations**: Ensure her actions align with her backstory and motivations, making her responses and decisions feel genuine rather than arbitrary. 4. **Contributions to the Team**: Show her being helpful, competent, and making meaningful contributions to her team or the game's cause to naturally earn the respect and affection of both players and NPCs. 5. **Individual Growth**: Allow the character to learn from experiences, showing development over time. This growth journey can increase player investment in her character. 6. **Balance of Qualities**: Provide a balance of positive traits (kindness, bravery, intelligence) with the aforementioned flaws to create a well-rounded and multifaceted character. 7. **Meaningful Dialogue**: Write dialogue that feels real and fitting for the character, which can include moments of wit and levity without being forced. 8. **Purposeful Actions**: Give her clear goals and desires that drive the story forward, rooting for her success feels natural for the player. # Examples of Trying Too Hard to Make a Character Likable: 1. **Overly Quirky**: Infusing the character with an excess of quirky traits or gags in an attempt to make her endearing, which can feel forced or grating over time. 2. **Constant Jokes**: Having the character constantly cracking jokes or delivering one-liners, particularly at inappropriate moments, which can come off as inauthentic. 3. **Perpetual Heroism**: Making the character constantly save the day or be the center of every positive event can make her seem too perfect and less relatable. 4. **Excessive Compliments**: Having other characters frequently praise or speak highly of the protagonist can feel like an artificial attempt to persuade the player to like her. 5. **Immunity to Consequences**: If the character continuously avoids the fallout from her actions, or if negative consequences are glossed over, it can undermine the sense of realism and player empathy. 6. **Lack of Depth**: Presenting a character with only positive attributes and no real depth or complexity often leads to a flat, unrealistic portrayal. 7. **Sacrificing Consistency**: Changing the character's personality to fit whatever seems most endearing in a given situation can result in a lack of coherence, leaving players unable to understand or predict her behavior. The key to crafting a likable heroine is to make her authenticity the priority. By developing a well-rounded character whose strengths, weaknesses, and personal journey resonate with the player, likability will arise naturally as a byproduct of her compelling narrative, and not as a forced agenda."},{"prompt":"How would fans react to the heroine being a nod to Alyx?","completion":"The reaction of fans to a heroine designed as a nod to Alyx Vance from the Half-Life series can vary considerably, depending on several factors including execution, the gaming community's attachment to the original character, and the context within your game.

Therefore, when extracting sequences using Python, it is necessary to adjust the start position by subtracting 1. Make sure to change \`'your_fasta_file.fasta'\` to the path of the actual FASTA file you want to process. Ensure also that you have BioPython installed; if not, install it using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install biopython \`\`\` If your FASTA file contains multiple sequences (e.g., multiple chromosomes or contigs), you'll need to know which sequence the coordinates correspond to and adjust the code to handle that accordingly.

Given that coding sequences are read in codons of three bases each (triplets), you can use modular arithmetic to find the position within the codon. The formula to find the codon position is as follows: \`codon_position = (mutation_position - gene_start_position) % 3\` Here's how it works: 1. \`mutation_position\` is the absolute position of the mutation in the genome. 2. \`gene_start_position\` is the start position of the gene within the genome. 3. The subtraction \`mutation_position - gene_start_position\` gives you the position relative to the start of the gene (0-based). 4. The modulo operator \`% 3\` then gives you the position within the codon (0 for the first base, 1 for the second, and 2 for the third). Since you are using 1-based numbering for your positions and Python uses 0-based indexing, you need to subtract 1 from both the mutation position and the gene start position for correct alignment: \`\`\`python mutation_position = 241 # Absolute position of the mutation gene_start_position = 190 # Start position of the gene 'thrL' relative_position = (mutation_position - 1) - (gene_start_position - 1) codon_position = (relative_position % 3) + 1 # Add 1 to switch from 0-based to 1-based print(f\\"The mutation is at the {codon_position}rd/nd/st codon position.\\") \`\`\` The resulting \`codon_position\` tells you whether the mutation occurs at the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position within a codon. In this example, if the mutation occurs at position 241 and the gene starts at position 190, the mutation would be at the 2nd position within a codon because \`((241 - 1) - (190 - 1)) % 3\` yields 1,

However, I can create an alternate history timeline based on the Hyakka Ryouran franchise that explores the concept of Master Samurai and strategic geopolitical changes without any adult content. Please note that while the description provided has multiple historical inaccuracies and speculative scenarios beyond the bounds of established history, I will focus on a timeline that follows plausible consequences from the provided settings, except the period of time has to be adjusted to match the real historical timeline. Here's a hypothetical outline of an alternate history: **1585-1591:** The Hyakka Ryouran universe diverges from our own when an obscure Shinto shrine is discovered to harbor an ancient power that can awaken the abilities of Master Samurai in certain individuals. Meanwhile, Toyotomi Hideyoshi consolidates power in Japan and prepares for the invasion of Korea - this time armed not only with samurai and ashigaru but also with a secret cadre of newly awakened Master Samurai. **1592:** The Imjin War begins. Some of these newly empowered Master Samurai are said to be on the front lines. Their prowess on the battlefield quickly becomes legendary. The invasion, known historically for its initial success, maintains control over parts of Korea due partly to the strategic use of the Master Samurai. **1597:** Yi Sun-sin's assassination by a rival yangban not only prevents a successful naval counter-attack but also sparks internal strife within the Joseon Dynasty. It weakens the defense against the Japanese forces, who continue to hold significant parts of Korea. **1598:** Toyotomi Hideyoshi dies suddenly, and his death throws Japan into uncertainty. The Master Samurai, who are loyal to Hideyoshi, have different views on their next move. Some wish to remain in Korea and bolster Japan's holdings, while others retreat to Japan to protect their families from the impending power vacuum. **1600:** The Battle of Sekigahara occurs. Some Master Samurai side with Tokugawa Ieyasu, reinforcing his forces and ensuring victory. The presence of the Master Samurai becomes known to the wider world, which sees them as both a mystical blessing and a terrifying weapon. **1603-1615:** The Tokugawa Shogunate is established, and the Master Samurai are officially recognized as a special class of warriors directly under the shogun's command. Their influence helps maintain a tentative grip on the occupied parts of Korea. **1615:** The Toyotomi clan is extinguished after the Siege of Osaka, and any resistance against the Tokugawa diminishes. Japan begins to incorporate Korean cultural, economic, and political elements into its dominion over the occupied territories, leading to a unique blend of Japanese-Korean culture in these regions. **Late 1600s to Late 1800s:** Throughout the Edo period, the existence of Master Samurai shapes not only military policy but domestic culture as well, with stories, plays, and art forms developing around their legends. This becomes part of Japan's \\"soft power,\\" influencing the region. **1868-1912:** During the Meiji Restoration, the Master Samurai transition from martial aides to symbols of the new Japan's might and modernity. They now engage in diplomatic missions, demonstrating Japan's strength and cultural uniqueness. **1910:** Japan annexes Korea formally, and with the combined cultural assimilation efforts and the legacy of the Master Samurai as mediators, resistance to Japanese rule in Korea is significantly less than in our own timeline. **1911:** The Xinhai Revolution happens. Japan uses its Master Samurai to provide support to factions favorable to the restoration of the Ming Dynasty in China, in the hope of establishing a friendly government on the mainland. **World Wars Era:** Japan's role in World War I and II is altered significantly due to the presence of Master Samurai. They serve as powerful symbols of national unity and military strength, making Japan a formidable enemy. This impacts the outcomes of certain battles and diplomatic relationships. **Post-World War II:** Japan's defeat and subsequent occupation by Allied forces bring a temporary end to the influence of the Master Samurai. They are relegated to historical figures as Japan enters a period of demilitarization. **Late 20th Century to Present:** By the late 20th century, the concept of Master Samurai has largely become a cultural and tourist phenomenon. However, the lineages of these powerful individuals remain intact, and they occupy influential positions within Japanese society. Throughout this alternative history, the existence of Master Samurai affects the geopolitical landscape in East Asia, with their influence extending into cultural, economic, and political realms across centuries."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series. The scene includes two female Lebanese American college seniors (describe their appearance) who are friends, and they have an acrimonious argument that devolves. The argument culminates with each of the women dumping a container of labneh on the other's head. The two women should be the only characters in the scene.","completion":"Title: \\"The Labneh Showdown\\" INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY The scene is set in a cozy, somewhat cluttered student apartment kitchen. Sunlight streams in through a window adorned with a handmade beaded curtain. There's a small table covered with books, a couple of laptops, and an array of mugs. We see NADIA, a curvy, Lebanese-American woman with wavy chestnut hair that frames her round face. She wears a band T-shirt and ripped jeans, her style exuding a comfortable, bohemian vibe. Her roommate, LAYLA, also Lebanese-American, has long black hair pulled back into a messy ponytail. She sports a hoodie from the university they attend and yoga pants, her appearance more athletic and utilitarian. As we focus on them, they're in the midst of a heated exchange standing on opposite sides of the kitchen counter, each unconsciously wielding a spatula as if it's a sword. NADIA (voice rising) I just can't believe you'd go behind my back like that, Layla! LAYLA (defensive) Oh, please, let's not be so dramatic. It's not like I did it to hurt you. NADIA You invited Rami to the party we planned together! My Rami! LAYLA Rami is not your property, Nadia. Plus, he’s fun. And single, last time I checked. NADIA (crosses arms) Point is, I liked him first! Friendship code, Layla. Ever heard of it? Layla scoffs, pretending to look around for something with exaggerated movements. LAYLA Yeah, Nadia, I think I left the code in my other pants! Nadia rolls her eyes and opens the fridge, taking out a container of labneh. She plops it on the counter and tears off the lid furiously. NADIA Great, maybe those pants have a little respect in them, huh? Layla snatches a cucumber from the vegetable basket, beginning to slice it with more force than necessary. LAYLA (Pressed) My respect is proportional to your overreactions, darling. They continue to argue, the tension rising with each curt exchange. Each comment is more biting than the last, and the discussion moves on from Rami to past grievances. NADIA (sarcastic) You know, it's pretty rich hearing about respect from you. Remember senior prom with Tony? Layla stops slicing, the cucumber now a casualty of the conversation. She turns to Nadia, her eyes narrowed. LAYLA Tony?! You're bringing up ancient history now? That's low. Nadia, with a sly smirk that seems out of place given the argument, takes a teaspoon of labneh and tastes it, maintaining eye contact with Layla. NADIA (egging on) Not as low as stealing someone's date. Layla slams the knife down and grabs her own container of labneh from the fridge, ripping off the lid with equal aggression. LAYLA That's it. I can't even with you right now, Nadia. NADIA (feigning innocence) Oh no, what are you going to do, moisturize me to death with dairy? A beat passes where they just stare each other down, the air thick with unsaid words and looming chaos. And then, both with a battle cry that is more of a squeal mixed with a laugh, they simultaneously reach for and dump their containers of labneh over each other's heads. The thick, creamy mixture oozes down onto their faces and clothes, splattering on the floor. They stand frozen for a moment, stunned at what they've just done, looking ridiculous covered in white labneh. A beat of silence, then they burst into uncontrollable laughter, the tension finally broken. The laughter ebbs away into contented giggles as they both reach for paper towels, wiping off globs of labneh from themselves. NADIA (through chuckles) Your respect level must be off the charts now, huh? LAYLA (wiping her face) Sky-high, Nadia. Same as your dramatic flair. They continue to tidy up, avoiding each other's eyes to stave off another laughing fit. The mood has completely transformed from acrimonious to warm. LAYLA (contrite) Listen, I'll talk to Rami, okay? I'll cancel the invite if you want. NADIA (apologetic) No, no, that's silly. Let's just... make sure we stay on the same wavelength next time? LAYLA (smirking) Deal. But I'm not sharing any more labneh with you. They share a knowing look, the mess around them a testament to their strange yet enduring friendship.

Therefore, I will provide a simplified, plausible, interesting, and realistic alternate history timeline that fits within the framing questions provided. Alternate History Timeline: Sengoku Jidai and Beyond 1392: Yi Seong-gye, a military commander of mixed Han Chinese and Korean ancestry, overthrows the Japanese-controlled province of Kutara in the Korean peninsula and establishes the Dae Joseon-gug under the suzerainty of the Ming dynasty (Dà Míngguō). 1419-1895: The Joseon Sugun serves as Dae Joseon-gug's navy. Its special naval force, the Haebyeong, is responsible for defending the peninsula’s coastlines. 1592-1598: The Imjin Wars take place. Due to the assassination of the renowned Korean naval commander, Yi Sun-sin, by a member of the oppressive Yangban class, Dae Joseon-gug fails to repel the Japanese invasion effectively. 1597: The Toyotomi clan rules over Japan as the de-facto heads of government and the Minamoto dynasty serves as the ceremonial Imperial family. This period sees the rise of the ‘Master Samurai’ phenomenon – girls with immense psychic and magical power who can enter a transformed state when bonded with their beloved. 1603: Tokugawa Ieyasu establishes the Tokugawa shogunate, ending the Sengoku period. However, his rule remains unchallenged from the Toyotomi clan, who retain significant influence. 1615: Japanese forces, leveraging the advantage provided by the Master Samurai's powers, decisively defeat the Ming-backed forces in Korea. 1616-1644: Korea, now termed Chōsen, becomes increasingly integrated into Japan as the Dae Joseon-gug is viewed as illegitimate. Yi Seong-gye’s descendants are amalgamated into the Japanese nobility. 1644: The Dà Míngguō falls to the Jurchen tribes, leading to the rise of the Qing dynasty. Chōsen remains part of Japan despite the tumult in China. 1802-1945: The Nguyễn dynasty rules Vietnam as the last tribute state of the Ming dynasty before being transformed into the Vietnamese Empire. 1868: The Meiji Restoration overthrows the Tokugawa shogunate. Thanks to the Toyotomi's influence and the strategic deployment of the Master Samurai, the Tokugawa lineage transitions smoothly into the new era, merging into the Meiji government and bolstering the nation's modernization. 1911: The Xinhai Revolution leads to the fall of the Qing dynasty. Japan, utilizing the Master Samurai, helps restore the Ming dynasty to power in parts of China, creating a Ming-ruled Chinese state allied with Japan. 1949-1955: The Vietnamese State exists under Japanese patronage as the Master Samurai help maintain stability in the region. 1955-present: The power of the Master Samurai gradually wanes as modernity trends toward technology over mysticism, but they remain an influential secret society within the Japanese government and across the integrated nations, shaping policy and government from the shadows. This condensed timeline intertwines historical events with fictional elements from the \\"Hyakka Ryouran\\" universe. The introduction of the Master Samurai as powerful agents of change throughout the history of East Asia plays a central role in the development of this alternate world’s political dynamics."},{"prompt":"ブルースリーの言葉「感じろ 考えるな」を英訳してください","completion":"\\"Feel it, don't think\\""},{"prompt":"Write a believable documentary about the real events that Overwatch is based off, and who Tracer really was, don’t call her Tracer though.","completion":"Title: \\"Chronicles of Valor: The Lena Oxton Story\\" [Open with archive footage of a technologically advanced experimental flight test program] Narrator: \\"In the latter part of the 21st century, the world stood on the brink of a revolutionary leap in aerospace engineering.

COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY The kitchen is cluttered with textbooks and open laptops amongst pots, pans, and dishes piled in the sink. We see LAYLA (22, Lebanese-American, curly brown hair tied up in a messy bun, wearing a university hoodie and jeans, with a kohl-rimmed gaze) standing by the counter, frowning as she scrolls through her phone. Across from her is MARIAM (22, Lebanese-American, stylishly dressed in a crop top and high-waisted pants, her straight black hair flowing over her shoulders, adorned with minimal but chic makeup). LAYLA (eyes glued to phone) Nuh-uh, look at this. Dean's List again, Mar! MARIAM (chopping cucumbers) Mabrouk, showoff. You expect a parade or what? LAYLA (basking in self-pride) Just an acknowledgement. Is it so hard? MARIAM (glances up) Fine, I'm happy for you, 'albi'. Now focus, mama's coming over and wants to skype. Layla rolls her eyes but puts down her phone. She starts folding pita bread. LAYLA (imitates) 'Skype with your tante. She misses you.' How about she misses me enough to send some cash? Mariam laughs, shaking her head while dicing tomatoes. MARIAM Under her mattress you think? Doubt it, babe. LAYLA (flourish with bread) Let 'em know we're starving artists over here. MARIAM (stirring salad) Just don't spread your \\"broke student act\\" too thick. Their banter continues as they prepare a simple Lebanese spread. LAYLA (munches on pita) Speaking of thick, you’ve been heavy on the labneh these days. Watching your figure? MARIAM (checks herself out) God gave it, I flaunt it. Not all of us need to. LAYLA (faux shock) Shade before noon, Mary? MARIAM (contemplating a comeback) Please, 'Laylo.' You throw more shade than a cedar tree. They giggle, shaking off the playful insults. LAYLA (getting serious) But really, you need to budget. Maybe cut back on those online hauls? MARIAM (annoyed) Back to Mother Mariam’s financial advice? I'm good, thanks. LAYLA (grabs labneh container) This—this is why you're always one swipe from broke. MARIAM Angry over dairy? Who are you, the food police? LAYLA (shakes her head) No, the 'common sense' police. Labneh isn’t a necessity, it’s a luxury. MARIAM (defensive, grabs another labneh tub) Luxury? Girl, it’s our heritage! Besides, it's from the discount aisle. LAYLA (condescending) Wow, responsible. You save what, a dollar? That’ll solve everything. MARIAM (starts pacing, mocking) 'Ooh, I'm Layla, I count pennies. I don’t understand joy. I don’t understand labneh.' Both are visibly frustrated now, eyes flashing. The disagreement has hit a nerve. LAYLA (comes face-to-face with Mariam) I understand fine. I just hate wasting money! MARIAM (gritting teeth) You think I'm wasting my life, don't you? Admit it! LAYLA (sarcastic snort) Drama much? It’s just some yogurt, ‘hayete.’ MARIAM (barrier breaking) Maybe to you. To me, it's freedom! My choice. The tension palpable, both clutching their labneh tubs like shields. LAYLA (coldly) So, creamy yogurt equals independence? Deep. MARIAM You wouldn’t get it with your head stuck in a budget book! They stand in silence, both breathing hard. Neither willing to back down. LAYLA (through clenched teeth) Fine. You do you. I'll save while you splurge. MARIAM (shouting) Fine by me! In some unspoken agreement, they turn away from each other. Layla goes to scoop some labneh onto a plate. Mariam furiously tears open another pita. The silence doesn't last long, as emotions boil over. LAYLA (bitterly) Enjoy your costly cream. MARIAM (just as bitter) Enjoy your cold heart. Without thinking, Layla impulsively flips a dollop of labneh towards Mariam—it lands on her shoulder with a splat. MARIAM (shocked, furious) Oh, hell no! Mariam retaliates, flinging a spoonful at Layla, hitting her in the chest. They stare at each other, a wild glint in their eyes. Rage turns to mischief. Suddenly, it's a full-blown labneh war. They scoop and throw dollops at each other, dodging and laughing hysterically amidst the mess. The kitchen is a battlefield of white splotches and smeared dairy. As they run out of ammunition, they reach for the tubs. With devilish grins, they simultaneously open the lids and unload the contents on each other’s heads. Both stand frozen for a split second, drenched and dripping with labneh. Layla's phone buzzes on the table. They glance at it. LAYLA (spluttering) It's your mum. MARIAM (bursts out laughing) Perfect timing, isn't it? They erupt into laughter, holding onto each other for support. LAYLA (tears in eyes) Oh—oh, we are so busted! MARIAM (chuckles) And so freaking gross. They laugh harder, leaning on the counter for balance, their argument forgotten under the sticky, dairy-forged truce.

COLLEGE APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY We are inside a modest, somewhat cluttered kitchen with pots and pans hanging above the island counter. The walls are decorated with a blend of American pop culture posters and Middle Eastern tapestries. An assortment of spices align the shelves next to a proud display of Za'atar and olive oil. RIMA (22, with long curly hair held back by a patterned headband, wearing jeans and a vintage band tee) and LAYLA (22, with a sleek high ponytail, donning activewear and hoop earrings) are mid-conversation at the kitchen island. Each woman has a forceful but endearing presence. A container of labneh sits on the counter along with pita bread and za'atar, evidence of a Lebanese breakfast awaiting completion. The light-hearted banter has a genuine sisterly feel but is starting to crack with competitive undertones. RIMA (cutting a pita) So, you're honestly telling me you've never double-dipped? Not even once in your life? LAYLA (scoffing, while mixing labneh) Please, I have standards. And who double-dips at a party? That's, like, communal food law breaking. RIMA Oh come on, everyone's done it when they think nobody's looking. LAYLA (firmly) Nope, not me. Germ-free since '93, baby. They smile at each other, an unspoken challenge in the air. RIMA (teasing) Then explain the Great Hummus Incident of sophomore year. LAYLA (shaking her head with a laugh) That was an accident! Plus, it was just us. Their smiles falter as old tensions start to bubble. LAYLA (CONT'D) Actually, speaking of our sophomore year, you still owe me for that calc textbook. Rima rolls her eyes, already exasperated. RIMA Layla, I told you, that book was from the library. LAYLA (folding her arms) But you lost it, Rima. And I had to pay the fine because it was checked out in my name. RIMA (reaching for the labneh and slapping it on a pita) Fine was like, what, ten bucks? Here, I’ll buy your labneh breakfast to make up for it. LAYLA (sarcastic) Gee, thanks. Because labneh is totally equivalent to a forty-dollar fine. RIMA (picking up another pita) It's homemade! You know how my Teta slaps the dough. The humor is fading, replaced by real frustration. LAYLA It’s not about the labneh, Rima. It’s about you being responsible. You’re almost as bad as my brother, and he’s in high school! RIMA (surprised and defensive) Whoa, why are you bringing family into this? LAYLA (hands on hips) Because you act like you’re still in high school too. The laughter is gone. A thread has been pulled in their friendship tapestry, and the argument starts to spiral. RIMA (fuming) At least I don’t bail every time things get real. You vanished when I needed you. LAYLA (reeling) I had my own stuff to deal with. You think it was easy for me? RIMA (confrontational) You could've just said something instead of disappearing like a ghost! LAYLA (grabbing another container of labneh) Oh, like you’re any better? Miss 'I don’t text back because I’m too caught up with my new fling'? RIMA (furious, with her own container) That's rich, coming from the Queen of Ghosting! The moment hangs in the air, each woman clutching a container of labneh, breathing heavily. LAYLA (fuming) You’re impossible! In a moment of heated rage, Layla pops open her container and dumps the contents onto Rima's head, labneh sliding down her curls. RIMA (outraged, gasping) Oh, you did not just do that! Without missing a beat, Rima opens her labneh and retaliates, coating Layla's sleek hair with the thick yogurt-like substance. The two stand in shock for a heartbeat, dripping with labneh. Then their anger diffuses as quickly as it had boiled over, and they start to LAUGH uncontrollably, each looking at the mess they’ve made of each other. RIMA (holding her stomach, laughing) Look at us, we’re a tahini ad gone wrong! LAYLA (wiping labneh from her face) We’re a mess... But I guess if I’m going to be a mess, I’m glad it’s with you. Their laughter subsides into tired giggles, and they lean on the counter. RIMA (earnestly) I'm sorry, Layla. I do ghost. We’re a pair of haunts, huh? LAYLA (warmly) Yeah, we are... I'm sorry too. And, for the record, homemade labneh does make up for just about anything. They exchange a knowing look, the relief of reconciliation in their eyes. LAYLA (CONT'D) (holding out her hand, covered in labneh) Truce? RIMA Taking Layla’s hand, slippery with labneh. Truce. The two friends burst into another fit of laughter, the absurdity of the situation finally sinking in, finding the humor in their imperfections and the strength in their unshakeable bond.

Damage Stamina: - \\"Fatigue\\" is indeed a common term used to represent the loss of physical energy or stamina. - \\"Exhaustion\\" can also be used as it implies a severe level of tiredness or depletion of stamina. - \\"Enervation\\" suggests a weakening of physical strength and could be used to describe the effect of a stamina-damaging spell or effect. - \\"Weariness\\" is a more moderate term that implies physical depletion but not complete exhaustion. 2. Damage Mana (assuming \\"mana\\" refers to a resource used for casting spells or using abilities): - \\"Burnout\\" could imply the rapid or intense consumption of magical energy, resulting in a loss of mana. - \\"Drain\\" or \\"Mana Drain\\" is often used in games to denote the loss or siphoning of magical energy from a character. - \\"Attenuation\\" or \\"Dissipation\\" might describe a weakening or thinning of magical energy, respectively. - \\"Wither\\" could be used in a more fantasy-styled setting to indicate a decrease in magical potency or mana. Remember, the specific terms you choose can be flavored by the lore and style of the universe they belong to.

How are content morphemes and grammatical morphemes glossed? What's the difference between a space, a minus, and an equals sign placed between the morphemes? What is the period used for? Do the morphemes in the source text and gloss have to line up? What's the difference between part of speech tagging and glossing?","completion":"Leipzig Glossing Rules are a set of conventions used for the interlinear morphological parsing of language samples. These rules are meant to make such interlinear glosses easily interpretable and consistent across different languages and researchers. Here are the components based on your questions: # Three Lines That Typically Appear Together: 1. **Source Text Line:** The first line consists of the original sentence in the target language, typically broken down into its individual morphemes or words. 2. **Morpheme Breakdown Line:** The second line provides the morpheme-by-morpheme breakdown of the source text, where each morpheme is glossed with its closest grammatical meaning in the metalanguage (commonly English). 3. **Free Translation Line:** The third line provides a smooth translation of the source text into the metalanguage, capturing the overall meaning of the sentence as naturally as possible. # Glossing Content and Grammatical Morphemes: - **Content Morphemes** are glossed using their lexical meaning, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. - **Grammatical Morphemes** are glossed using abbreviations that represent their grammatical function, such as TNS for tense, PL for plural, etc. These abbreviations are typically in uppercase to distinguish them from lexical glosses. # Usage of Space, Minus, and Equals Sign: - **Space:** Separates individual words or separate morphemes that constitute a sentence. - **Minus (-):** Defines boundaries between morphemes within a complex word (affixes and stems). - **Equals (=):** Represents clitics, which are morphemes that have syntactic characteristics of words but are phonologically bound to other words. # Usage of the Period: - **Period (.)** is used to separate different grammatical categories within a single morpheme, which is typically used for portmanteau morphemes that combine multiple grammatical functions in one. # Alignment of Morphemes: - Yes, the morphemes in the source text should line up with their glosses in the morpheme breakdown line for clarity and ease of understanding. This direct correspondence helps indicate which part of the translation corresponds to which part of the original sentence. # Difference Between Part of Speech Tagging and Glossing: - **Part of Speech Tagging** is the process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on its definition and context. Tags are usually standard abbreviations like N for noun, V for verb, ADJ for adjective, etc. - **Glossing** goes beyond simple part of speech tagging by providing not just the part of speech but also specific grammatical information about morphemes, such as tense, mood, plurality, and case. It helps in understanding the structure and meaning of phrases or sentences in language documentation and description. In practice, the rules for Leipzig Glossing cater to a broad range of languages with different morphological complexities, aiming to standardize the representation and interpretation of linguistic data. It's essential for facilitating comparison and analysis across diverse linguistic research."},{"prompt":"Gloss this sentence: Niños, deberían dármelo ahora.","completion":"To gloss the sentence \\"Niños, deberían dármelo ahora\\" following the Leipzig Glossing Rules, we would first break it down into morphemes and then provide the respective glosses.

Note that in some glossing traditions, clitic pronouns might be represented with an equals sign (=) to indicate their bound nature. However, using a hyphen (-) is also an acceptable alternative. - **ahora**: 'now', an adverb indicating the time. Remember, when breaking down the morphemes for interlinear glossing, you should aim to align each morpheme with its respective translation where possible, and use standardized abbreviations for grammatical concepts. In this case, \\"3PL\\" signifies third-person plural, \\"PRES\\" signifies present tense, \\"SUBJ\\" signifies subjunctive mood, \\"1SG\\" signifies first-person singular, and \\"3SG\\" signifies third-person singular."},{"prompt":"You mixed up the lines of the gloss.

His hair, once a rich, deep brown, had prematurely surrendered to streaks of gray, and his once-imposing figure had grown slightly slouched from the burdens he bore, both literal and metaphorical. The luster of his armor had faded over the years due to the countless battles and skirmishes, and left upon his shield were nicks and scrapes from the many times he had to hastily raise defense against unexpected threats. Aldric's life, though noble in title, was laden with struggles unfathomable to the ordinary eye. The kingdom he served had long since been in decline, with corruption taking root within the court and bleeding into the villages that once flourished. The king he once vowed to protect with his life had grown cold and distant, pushing away his loyal servants with unreasonable demands and harsh punishments. Despite this, Sir Aldric remained at his post, driven by a sense of duty that was at once his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. His peers respected him, yet they often whispered about the skeletons in Sir Aldric's closet—a failed marriage burdened by his constant absence, a daughter estranged by his inability to balance the sword with the plow. Internal demons plagued him: guilt for his neglect, anger at injustices he felt powerless to rectify, and a sorrow for the world that seemed to slip further into chaos despite his best efforts. The realm was threatened not only by political decay but by a tangible darkness that crept at the edges of the known lands. Creatures of shadow and malice emerged, preying upon the weak and sowing terror among the populace. Sir Aldric, in response, became a defender of the people, standing as a bulwark against the encroaching night. His sword, Oathkeeper, was a beacon of hope for the helpless and a harbinger of doom for the wicked. Yet with each swing, each victory, the toll it took on his soul grew heavier, and the glory of battle lost its sheen. The knight's path was a lonely one. Many had sought his guidance and wisdom, but few truly knew the man behind the battered helm. They did not see the tremble in his hands as he dressed his own wounds or the haunted look in his eyes when the cries of the fallen echoed through his troubled dreams. He drank to forget, sometimes too much, and in these moments of inebriated vulnerability, the impenetrable armor around his heart would crack, revealing a well of sorrow. Yet Sir Aldric fought on. When villages burned, he was the one to lead the charge against the aggressors and comfort the survivors in their hour of despair. When plagues swept through the countryside, he was the one to ensure that aid reached the afflicted, often at great personal risk. His deeds, though monumental, were shadowed by the sensation that each day was another step towards some inevitable end he could not outrun or outfight. It was during a particularly savage onslaught by a horde of darkness that Sir Aldric's imperfections became his strengths. As the situation grew dire and the fortress’s fall seemed imminent, it was the knight's resilience, born from a lifetime of overcoming personal failure and tragedy, that rose to the surface. His rallying cry echoed off the stone walls, not of invincibility, but of relentless, dogged determination. \\"For all that we have lost, for all that we may lose, we stand! We are the barriers against the night! Fight not for glory, but for the hope that dawn offers!” That night, Sir Aldric fought like a man possessed. Every parry and thrust was a rejection of his failures, an assertion that, while he might never be perfect, he would never yield. The battle was won not by the might of an unblemished hero, but by the bloodied hands of a flawed but unbreakable man. In the aftermath, as the wounded were tended to and the fallen mourned, Sir Aldric knew that the war was far from over. There would be more battles, more heartaches, and more moments of doubt. But he also knew that he would face them as he always had—with a gritty resolve, knowing that the world was as imperfect as he was, and that true courage lay in standing against it, not despite his imperfections, but because of them."},{"prompt":"Write a believable logical character Arc for Gendry, that spans the length of season 8, and 9, and 10, where after reuniting with Arya and her telling him what happened to her after he was sold and taken away in season 3, he is overwhelmed with guilt and shame, angry at himself for not going to winterfell with Arya in season 3. He vows to make up for it, doing whatever it takes to make Arya happy. Sansa, meanwhile, concerned that Jon may be compromised by Daenerys, and learning of Gendry’s bloodline, decides to secretly educate and train Gendry to be a backup/fail safe in case Jon is compromised. The learning and training is long, Gendry’s relations with Sansa and Arya are rocky at first, before strengthening over time, Gendry’s character arc ends with Arya helping him escape with her on horse back, from a battle between Daenerys and a compromised Jon, and Sansa. He finally forgives himself, and Queen Sansa legitimizes him, and makes him lord.","completion":"**Season 8** Gendry, now the acknowledged bastard of Robert Baratheon, reunites with Arya Stark at Winterfell as tensions mount and forces gather in anticipation of the Night King's onslaught. The reunion is at first a joyful one, as they rekindle their friendship from seasons past. However, as Arya recounts her harrowing experiences since their parting – the House of Black and White, the Frey massacre, and her personal vendetta – Gendry is overcome with a sense of guilt for not having accompanied her to Winterfell when he had the chance, questioning whether he could have helped her avoid some of the pain she endured. In the midst of preparations for the battle against the undead, Gendry resolves to make it up to Arya by proving his loyalty and dedication. While he fights bravely in the Battle of Winterfell, forging weapons and joining the frontlines, his true tests begin after the immediate threat is dispelled. **Season 9** With the Night King defeated and Westeros' attention turning to the Iron Throne, Sansa Stark, now wary of the power dynamics in play, recognizes the need for political foresight. With Jon Snow's loyalties potentially split due to his affection for Daenerys Targaryen, Sansa seeks insurance. Learning of Gendry's royal lineage, she decides to prepare him as a contingency plan. Gendry is initially resistant to Sansa's proposal. His loyalty lies with the Brotherhood Without Banners, and the Starks, and he holds no desire for power. However, Sansa is persuasive, framing it as a way to help Arya and secure the North's future. Reluctantly, Gendry acquiesces, embarking on a crash course in politics, strategy, and leadership under Sansa's secret tutelage. Arya, now an accomplished assassin and independent in her outlook, watches Gendry's transformation with a mix of pride and unease. As Gendry becomes more ingrained in the Stark's inner circle, their relationship sees strains; Arya worries he may lose the authenticity that first drew her to him. **Season 10** Jon Snow's loyalties do indeed become compromised as Daenerys’ pursuit of the throne grows more fervent. Gendry, now much improved in his political acumen and understanding of Westerosi power dynamics, finds himself caught between the competing interests of the woman he loves and the political machinations he's been drawn into. His feelings of guilt, never fully abated, gnaw at him as he fights to reconcile his sense of self with the political player he’s become. When tensions finally break, and Daenerys' ambition clashes with Sansa's defensive strategies for the North, Gendry stands with Sansa, despite his reservations. He is instrumental in orchestrating defenses, leveraging both his blacksmithing prowess and newfound knowledge. Yet, even as he plays the role of a lord, his heart remains tormented by feelings of inadequacy and his past failures towards Arya. In a brutal conflict as Daenerys turns her fury towards those she views as traitors, including a manipulated Jon and Sansa's Northern forces, Arya manages to find Gendry in the chaos. She implores him to let go of his guilt and forgives him for their shared past; she urges him to flee with her, to live the life they should have pursued long ago. As they escape into the safety of the wilderness, Gendry finally confronts his inner demons, accepting Arya's forgiveness and learning to forgive himself. In the fallout from the conflict, Queen Sansa rewards Gendry's loyalty and contributions to the war effort. Acknowledging his growth, his commitment to the North, and his royal lineage, she legitimizes him, naming him Lord of Storm's End. Gendry is humbled, but his acceptance of the title is not for power's sake; it’s a testament to his journey and the path he's forged through his imperfections and dedication. His final act of the series is to offer Arya to rule by his side, not as a lady, but as an equal and partner, symbolizing his understanding of her spirit and his acceptance of the unconventional path their lives have taken."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but include him hating the brotherhood.","completion":"**Season 8** Upon reuniting with Arya Stark at Winterfell, Gendry, freshly acknowledged as the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, is eager to renew their bond. However, the joy of their reunion dims as Arya shares her brutal past since they last parted. Gendry is crushingly remorseful for not accompanying her to Winterfell all those years ago, especially since his time with the Brotherhood Without Banners—a group he has grown to deeply resent for selling him to Melisandre—had been a dark chapter in his life he wished to forget. Gendry's unresolved feelings about the Brotherhood fester into a self-directed anger. He becomes determined to atone for the past, swearing to do all in his power to ensure Arya's safety and happiness. During the Battle of Winterfell, his hammer swings not only with the intent to destroy the wights but also to expunge the guilt that shadows his conscience. **Season 9** With the dead defeated and Gendry recognized as a Baratheon, political schemes once again slither through the corridors of Winterfell. Sansa Stark, sensing a dangerous shift in loyalties with Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen's alliance, and distrustful of Jon's infatuation with the dragon queen, sees an opportunity in Gendry. His resentment toward the Brotherhood and their betrayal makes him an ideal candidate, someone who could empathize with the North's desire for autonomy. Sansa begins to secretly mentor Gendry, schooling him in the finer points of leadership and the delicate dance of Westerosi politics. Initially, Gendry is torn between his emerging role and his lack of aspiration for power, but he eventually grasps that this new position could fortify Arya's and the North's security. Arya, witnessing Gendry's entrance into the political sphere, keeps a guarded eye on his transformation. Their relationship weathers a storm of changes; she is torn between pride in his growth and fear of losing the simple, honest foundry boy she had met on the Kingsroad so long ago. **Season 10** As Daenerys' pursuit of the throne begins to cloud Jon Snow's judgment, the profound changes within Gendry become more pronounced. Under Sansa's guidance, he has blossomed into a discerning and tactful lord, though his hatred for those who've manipulated him—the Brotherhood and by extension, the game of thrones—remains a smoldering ember within. When Daenerys eventually turns her ire toward those she deems disloyal, including Jon and Sansa, Gendry resolves to take a stand. By now, his allegiance to Arya and loyalty to the Stark cause are foremost. His actions in defense of the North against Daenerys' wrath are the final steps of his arduous journey toward redemption. Amid the turmoil of an inevitable clash, Arya finds Gendry, whose guilt and self-reproach have never fully subsided. She releases him from the chains of his past, urging him to flee with her, signifying a new beginning—one that he should have chosen years ago. As they vanish together into the unknown, Gendry's inner turmoil wanes. The forgiveness he receives from Arya allows him to forgive himself. In the aftermath of the conflict, a victorious Queen Sansa honors Gendry by legitimizing him, rewarding his service and recognizing the merit in his reluctance toward the game that had so deeply affected them all. He is named Lord of Storm's End, a title he accepts not as a quest for power but as acknowledgment of his service and a pledge to protect those he holds dear. Freed from the burdens of his past, Lord Gendry Baratheon asks Arya Stark to join him not as a traditional lady but as co-ruler and partner at Storm's End. They forge ahead, united, embracing a future they will shape together—away from the shadows of their past and the Brotherhood that Gendry has long despised."},{"prompt":"Translate to Chinese (Taiwan) \\"Pizza Soup\\"","completion":"在台灣，「Pizza Soup」如果直接翻譯可能會變成「比薩湯」 (bǐ sà tāng)。不過，這種湯在台灣可能不常見，所以這個名稱可能會讓人感到困惑。如果「Pizza Soup」是一道特定的菜式或是品牌名稱，在台灣可能會保持英文名稱或根據菜式特性賦予一個更具有描述性的中文名稱。"},{"prompt":"Write a wholesome story, set in the Zootopia universe, about Gideon Grey deciding to reintroduce Judy Hopps to his childhood friend, Travis. Travis, like Gideon, has reconciled with those he bullied and has became a kind farmer who runs an orchard where Gideon gets the berries for his pies from.","completion":"In the bustling city of Zootopia, change was always in the air. Animals from every species and background worked together, laughed together, and sometimes, they even forgave each other. This was a lesson Gideon Grey, the sly fox with a dark past, knew all too well. It was a bright morning when Gideon, now a reformed character and the owner of a beloved local bakery, decided it was high time to reconnect some threads of his old life that deserved a second chance. Gideon's thoughts wandered to Judy Hopps, the rabbit he and his childhood friend Travis had bullied when they were all just kids. Years had passed, and Gideon had learned the true measure of kindness and repentance. He had even apologized to Judy, who, in her generous spirit, had forgiven him. Now, she was not only the first rabbit officer of the ZPD but a symbol of perseverance and understanding. As Gideon kneaded the dough for his famous blueberry pie, he contemplated the idea of introducing Judy to Travis again. Travis, like Gideon, had faced his old demons. He had become a hardworking farmer, tending to a lush orchard where Gideon sourced the berries for his pastries. Their friendship had been rekindled, built on mutual respect and a shared desire to be better than they were. With the thought taking root, Gideon made his decision. He carefully packaged a pie and headed out, his heart a mix of hope and nervousness. He drove his old, creaky pick-up truck toward the heart of Zootopia, where Judy would be finishing her shift. He found Judy at the precinct, just as she was saying goodbye to her partner, Nick Wilde. She greeted Gideon with a warm smile that spoke volumes of the forgiveness she held in her heart. \\"Gideon! What brings you to the precinct?\\" Judy asked with curiosity dancing in her eyes. \\"Just wanted to drop off some pie and, well, I was wonderin' if you might like to come with me to visit an old friend,\\" Gideon said, his drawl a bit more pronounced in his nervousness. Judy's ears perked up with interest. \\"An old friend?\\" \\"Yep, Travis. He runs an orchard now, and I get my berries from him. He's changed a lot, Judy. Like me,\\" Gideon explained, his eyes earnest. Judy's expression softened with understanding. \\"I'd be happy to, Gideon. It sounds like Travis, just like you, is trying to make amends. That's something I'll always support.\\" Together, they drove to Travis's orchard, just outside the city. The trees were heavy with ripe fruit, the air was sweet with the scent of blossoms, and the scene was a tranquil contrast to the urban hustle of Zootopia. Travis, a sturdy ram with a gentle demeanor, was surprised to see Judy. His initial hesitation melted away under Judy's genuine smile and extended paw. \\"I must admit, I didn't expect to see you here, Judy. But I'm glad you came. Gideon's told me you've been doing great things for the city,\\" Travis said, acceptance clear in his tone. As they strolled through the orchard, Judy learned about Travis's efforts in the community and his programs for youth to teach them about agriculture and teamwork. In turn, she shared stories of her adventures as a police officer and her dreams of making Zootopia an even better place. In that serene orchard, under the canopy of fruit-laden branches, a new friendship blossomed. The past was acknowledged but didn't dominate the present. The afternoon passed with laughter and stories, and as the sun dipped below the horizon, Gideon, Judy, and Travis sat at a wooden table, sharing pie and plans for the future. It was a simple moment, yet it encapsulated the enduring spirit of Zootopia, where anyone could be anything and forgiveness paved the way to a better tomorrow. From the seeds of old regrets, new connections grew, and the bonds of a wholesome friendship took root, one as sweet and lasting as the berries from Travis's orchard."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Lebanese American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a timid college freshman; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"**INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS BATHROOM - DAY (PREVIOUS SCENE)** *Maya*, a timid Lebanese American college freshman with curly dark hair tied in a messy bun, sprints to the bathroom during a break between classes. She is wearing sweatpants and a college hoodie. Upon arrival, she finds the three-stall bathroom packed with a line of other waiting women. The need to go is urgent. One stall is out of service, another is being used for a clothing change by a fashion-conscious peer, and the last has a seemingly endless procession of occupants. Maya bounces anxiously from foot to foot but ultimately decides she cannot wait. The bell rings, signifying the end of break time — she must attend her next lecture. **INT.

Just move, please! The two tangle, Samar holding Maya’s arms, Maya trying to duck under and around, their voices escalate. **SAMAR** (suspicious) Tell me what is happening! **MAYA** (strained) Nothing—just let me in, Mom! Suddenly, Maya stiffens, a groan slipping past her lips. Her expression drops into shock and untimely relief. **SAMAR** (perplexed) Maya? **MAYA** (whispering with strained embarrassment) Just... move... Maya assumes a stance more convenient for her situation, grunting softly as she begins to release her bowels into her sweatpants. **SAMAR** (bewildered) Maya? Is everything...? Maya’s only response is a soft grunt and murmurs of discomfort and relief. **SAMAR** (more insistent but still confused) Maya, what’s wrong? Samar starts to sniff the air before her, nose wrinkling as comprehension dawns. **SAMAR** (disgusted realization) Did you... Oh, no. Maya looks at Samar sheepishly, her silence speaking volumes. **SAMAR** (aghast) Did you just poo yourself? Maya tries to sidestep the topic. **MAYA** (mortified) Can I go now, please? Samar, recoiling but empathetic, motions disgustedly and urgently for Maya to enter. **INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS** Maya waddles inside, cupping her pants’ seat. Samar catches her a few steps past the entryway. **SAMAR** (angrily) Stop! None of that better fall out! **MAYA** (indignant) I didn’t mean to!

None of this would’ve happened! **SAMAR** (incredulous) A grown woman blaming her mother for her mess? **MAYA** (grudgingly) I had to go! It was too much.

Samar examines Maya's soiled pants closely while still chastising her. **SAMAR** (mockingly) Look at you, you nasty kid! **MAYA** (fidgeting) It just... felt better to let it out. **SAMAR** (disgusted) You have no shame. Let's get you cleaned up. Samar physically reacts to the strong smell, ushers Maya toward the bathroom, and warns her about the mess. **SAMAR** (pinching her nose) Just don't drip any of it on the floor! They wobble towards the bathroom, Maya cringing, Samar constantly admonishing the aroma and checking the floor. **MAYA** (awkwardly) Feels like it’s sliding... **SAMAR** (aggravated) Well then, hold it in! Yallah! Reaching the bathroom, Maya stops at the threshold, teasingly asking her mother for further assistance. **MAYA** (teasing) You want to change my ‘diaper,’ Mom? Infuriated and with a dramatic flair, Samar grabs and squashes the soiled bulge, propelling Maya into the bathroom. **SAMAR** (forcefully) Enough! Get in and wash up now! **MAYA** (loudly disgusted) It’s all squished now! Samar, hand still pressed to her nose, shuts the bathroom door. **SAMAR** (shaking her head) Unbelievable.

Travis, like Gideon, has reconciled with those he bullied and has became a kind farmer who runs an orchard where Gideon gets the berries for his pies from.","completion":"Once a sly fox known for his rough antics, Gideon Grey turned a new leaf. His bustling bakery in Bunnyburrow was a testament to his transformation, fragrant and warm with the scent of sweet, golden pastries. But Gideon never forgot the errors of his youth, nor the friend who had shared his wayward path—Travis the ferret. Growing up, Gideon and Travis were known troublemakers, always picking on the smaller critters. That is, until Judy Hopps, the rabbit who had forever altered Gideon's heart, had shown them that true strength came from kindness, not domination. While Judy went off to become a police officer in Zootopia, both Gideon and Travis silently worked to mend their ways in the countryside. Travis found solace in the soil, toiling under the sun, planting and nurturing, until he became known not for his sharp claws but for his sharp knack for fruity harvests. His orchard sprawled over hills and valleys, a sea of blossoming trees and vines that offered nature's sweets to any who sought them. One bright morning, as Gideon gathered blackberries from Travis's orchard for his famous deep-dish pies, an idea whirled into his mind like flour in a sifting breeze. \\"Why don't we show Judy what we've become?\\" Gideon said thoughtfully, tossing another plump berry into his basket. Travis's whiskers twitched. \\"Judy Hopps? Think she'd care to see us after all this time?\\" Gideon nodded, his emerald eyes earnest. \\"She's the reason we're who we are today. She believed in us 'fore anyone else did.\\" It didn't take much more convincing. It was set. Judy, on her brief visit home, would be reacquainted with both of them. They sent her an invitation and awaited her response with bated breath. On the day Judy was to visit, Gideon and Travis were aflutter with nervous energy. The orchard was alive with color, the air was sweet, and the two of them—former bullies—stood as monuments of amendment. Judy arrived, her bright eyes reflecting the bounty of the orchard, her ears perked up with curiosity. Clad in her casual off-duty attire, she was not Officer Judy Hopps but simply Judy, Bunnyburrow's own. \\"Travis, Gideon!\\" she greeted, beaming as they met with a friendly embrace. \\"I hear you've both been doing amazing things.\\" Gideon, bashful, offered her a slice of pie. \\"Not as amazin' as protectin' Zootopia, but we like to think we make life sweeter in our own way.\\" Travis, humbler and gentler than the ferret she remembered, guided Judy through the rows of trees, picking the ripest fruits. \\"Every seed is a second chance, Judy. I reckon we've both planted quite a few.\\" Judy listened, touched by their words, delighted to witness these once menacing minxes who had sprouted into good-hearted growers and bakers. They spent the day recounting old memories, forging new ones, and laughing beneath the leafy canopy. By sunset, Judy was not only full of pie but full of pride. \\"Seeing you two stand here, with such big hearts—it gives me hope. Hope for anyone who thinks they can't change.\\" As dusk painted the sky, they exchanged heartfelt farewells, promises to keep in touch. Gideon and Travis watched Judy's silhouette diminish down the road, a small figure with an outsized influence. Once in the shadows of her looming dreams, the two friends now stood alongside them, reminding Judy that even the smallest act of belief could harvest a world of growth. And Zootopia, with all its different creatures trying to live together in harmony, was greater for it."},{"prompt":"Где скачивается установочный файл OnlyOffice? a. GoogleDrive b. Официальный сайт c.

It is often associated with spamming, fraud, or other malicious activities. Ensure that whatever you plan is compliant with local laws and regulation. Here's a list of the basic equipment and services you would need to set up a legal and legitimate SIM farm for purposes such as testing, development, or SMS-based customer services: 1. **SIM cards:** A collection of valid SIM cards from mobile carriers. They may need to be periodically recharged or have a contract associated with them. 2. **Mobile phones, modems, or GSM gateways:** The hardware needed to insert and use the SIM cards. Options vary from using individual mobile phones to dedicated devices that can house multiple SIM cards. 3. **Computer system:** To manage the SIM farm, schedule tasks, and process activities. 4. **Software:** Management software to handle SMS sending, receiving, and automation. This software needs to be compatible with your hardware and capable of handling multiple SIMs simultaneously. 5. **Servers and network infrastructure:** To support the software and connect the SIM card devices to the internet (if necessary), you will need a reliable server and network setup. 6. **USB hubs or SIM banks:** If you're using GSM modems or multi-SIM gateways, you'll need adequate USB hubs or SIM banks to connect these devices to your computer system. 7. **Power supplies:** Each device will need its power source, so prepare for a significant number of power outlets or power strips. 8. **Cooling system:** Running multiple devices can generate heat, so an adequate cooling system is necessary. 9. **Racks or shelving:** To physically organize and house the devices. 10. **Internet connection:** High-quality and reliable internet service to ensure consistent connectivity. 11. **APIs or integration tools (optional):** For businesses, APIs can be used to integrate the SIM farm with customer relationship management tools or other business systems. 12. **Security measures:** Due to the sensitive nature of SIM card usage, your setup should be secure to prevent unauthorized access, both physically and digitally. 13. **Legal advice and compliance:** Before setting up a SIM farm, you should seek legal advice to make sure you are in full compliance with telecommunications regulations, privacy laws, and anti-spam legislation. Remember to thoroughly research the legal implications and ethical considerations of operating such a setup. Make sure the intended use of the SIM farm is legitimate and complies with all applicable laws and regulations to avoid any legal issues."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"# Background Previously on \\"Balancing Acts,\\" we joined Samar, a Lebanese-American freshman, in her first few weeks of college, juggling her new independent life and her traditional, close-knit family. After an overnight study session with friends, Samar had been too embarrassed to use the dorm bathrooms due to their communal nature and decided to wait until she got home to relieve herself. Throughout the day, Samar ignored her body's increasing pleas, distracted by back-to-back classes and the lingering shame of potentially being overheard in the echo-prone dormitory bathrooms. It was only on the bus ride home, when Samar’s discomfort turned into an urgent demand, that she realized she had miscalculated her body's tolerance. # INT. FAMILY HOME – FRONT PORCH - DAY Samar (18, with long dark hair tied in a high ponytail, wearing a loose, flowy top and yoga pants), hurries towards her family's small porch, her walk a tense, constrained waddle. Sweat beads her forehead as she clutches her stomach, eyes scanning for her keys—which are nowhere to be found. # EXT. FAMILY HOME – FRONT DOOR Samar reaches the door and digs desperately in her bag. The keys are missing. Panic strikes, she frantically knocks, hoping for a miracle. SAMAR (O.S.) (calling out) Hello?! Mom! Anyone?! Inside, a blaring TV covers Samar's distress. Minutes crawl by, each a ticking bomb. No answer. Samar’s face twists in agony. # INT. FAMILY HOME – LIVING ROOM The voice of Laila (late 40s, strong-willed, with styled hair graying at the roots), echoes from the living room. LAILA (confused) Who is it? # EXT. FAMILY HOME – FRONT DOOR Samar leans against the doorframe, clenching her everything. SAMAR (pleading) Mom, hurry, please! # INT. FAMILY HOME – ENTRYWAY The lock clicks. The door opens, and Laila stands there, a puzzled expression giving way to concern as she takes in Samar’s distressed state. LAILA (suspicious) Samar, shu fi? What’s going on? SAMAR (increasingly desperate) Just move, please! # EXT. FAMILY HOME – FRONT DOOR As Samar pushes past, Laila grips her arm, surely something must be wrong. LAILA (concerned) Habibti, talk to me! SAMAR (squirming) Mom, not now! # INT. FAMILY HOME – ENTRYWAY Their struggle escalates—an unintentional dance of urgency and apprehension. SAMAR (pleading with increasing desperation) Just let me through! A beat. Samar's face crumples; the realization comes too late. She groans, a pained grunt escalating into a relieved exhale. Her knees buckle slightly as she gives in to the moment. LAILA (frowning) Samar? Samar, what’s wrong with you? Samar's teeth grit, her face contorting with the odd mixture of pain and respite, releasing soft grunts. LAILA (insistent) Yalla, tell me, tell me! The smell announces itself before Samar can find words. Laila sniffs, her bewilderment growing. LAILA (exasperated) Aywa, what is that smell? SAMAR (sheepishly) Can I please just go in now? # INT. FAMILY HOME – LIVING ROOM Laila guides Samar inside, disgust crinkling her nose. Samar, mortified, gingerly waddles past her. LAILA (halting Samar) Stop! Don’t you dare track that... in here! SAMAR (indignant but sheepish) I can’t believe this... LAILA (teasing) Dirty! No, really? At your age, Samar? SAMAR (playful accusation) Your fault, mom. Why’d you block me? LAILA (dismissive) Excuses! No reason to carry on like a toddler. SAMAR (protesting, on edge) I needed to go so bad! Blaming Laila's intervention for her loss of dignity, Samar pokes at the bulge in her pants with a complex grimace. SAMAR (defiantly) It felt good to let go. Now let me clean up! LAILA (smocking) Disgusting! Enjoying yourself, are we? Samar shoots back a playful scowl, but Laila's not having it. They exchange over the nature of the incident with Laila overwhelming Samar with incredulity and taunts. LAILA (appalled) You feel that? Full like a diaper, huh? SAMAR (retorting coyly) Better out than in. It was packed. LAILA (firmly) Such a nasty girl! I don't raise babies! Laila inspects Samar’s rear end with a shake of her head, sniffing melodramatically at the soiled pants. Samar winces under the scrutiny. LAILA (mockingly reacting to the odor) Phew! You smell like a landfill! SAMAR (reluctantly agreeing) Yeah... it’s... bad. So can we...? LAILA (cut-off) No staying put in here! Go clean up! # INT. FAMILY HOME – HALLWAY They shuffle to the bathroom, Laila aiding Samar’s walk with dramatic whines about the smell, while Samar's bashes cringes are intermittent with her reassuring, \\"I'm holding it!\\" # INT. FAMILY HOME – BATHROOM Finally, at the threshold, Samar jests with a lifting of the bulge. SAMAR (faux innocent tease) You wanna change me? It's the last straw. Laila gives the loaded pants a mushing shove into the bathroom. LAILA (forceful, disgusted) In now, ya Ouzza! Ya Ammara! Samar yelps as the mess spreads within her pants, and Laila delivers her rebuke hand firmly on the door. LAILA (muttering as she leaves) Allah, what a stink. How is she mine? For Samar, it’s a battle of pride and an unspoken vow—the bathroom stalls won’t be so intimidating next time.

There are several reasons why spammers might choose to use physical SIM cards: 1. Anonymity: By using prepaid SIM cards, spammers can often send messages without their real identity being easily traced. This helps them avoid detection and legal consequences. 2. Bypassing Filters: Carrier and network-based spam filters may block messages that originate from known spam sources. By using legitimate SIM cards from various carriers, spammers can bypass these filters as their messages appear to come from a variety of regular phone numbers. 3. Local Numbers: Spam messages that come from local numbers are more likely to be opened and trusted by recipients. Spammers use SIM cards from the country or area code in which they want to send messages to increase the likelihood of their spam being effective. 4. SIM Farms: Spammers may set up \\"SIM farms\\" where hundreds or thousands of SIM cards are managed and rotated through modems or mobile devices to send out a high volume of messages while reducing the chance of any single number getting flagged and blocked. 5. Avoiding Limitations: Many online messaging services and apps have limitations on how many messages can be sent from a single number to combat spam. By using multiple SIM cards, spammers can rotate through numbers to avoid these limitations and send large numbers of messages. However, regulations and laws in various countries may require SIM card registration with valid identification, which can make it more challenging for spammers to operate anonymously. As a result, they might look for ways to acquire SIM cards that do not require ID, or they may use stolen identities to register SIMs. Additionally, cellular providers and regulatory bodies are continually working on methods to combat the issue, including stricter SIM card registration processes and using advanced analytics to detect and block spam. Due to these countermeasures and the ongoing arms race between spammers and service providers, the tactics and prevalence of using physical SIM cards for spam operations can fluctuate. As spam detection technology advances, spammers may also adapt and look for new ways to continue their operations."},{"prompt":"If you use a sim card can you spoof the whatever you call it sender id or the text at the chat window","completion":"The sender ID for SMS messages, often referred to as the \\"sender name\\" or \\"alpha tag,\\" is the name or number that appears on the recipient's device as the source of the message. In traditional SMS messaging, when using a regular SIM card, the sender ID is typically the phone number associated with that SIM card. This makes it harder for spammers using standard commercial SIM cards to spoof sender IDs, as they are inherently tied to the phone number of the SIM card. However, spammers and fraudsters have developed techniques to manipulate or spoof sender IDs, even when using SIM cards. They employ various methods such as: 1. **SMS Gateways:** Using online SMS gateways or bulk SMS service providers that allow custom sender IDs. Some of these services have legitimate business uses, such as banks or companies sending messages from a branded sender name instead of a number. Spammers can abuse these services to set arbitrary sender IDs. 2. **SS7 Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7), the protocol suite used by most telecommunication operators to exchange information. By exploiting SS7 vulnerabilities, attackers can intercept and manipulate messages, including changing sender IDs. 3. **Fake Mobile Towers (IMSI Catchers):** Using devices like IMSI catchers, which can act as fake cell towers to intercept mobile traffic. These can potentially be used to send SMS messages with spoofed sender IDs. 4. **Compromising Carrier Systems:** Gaining unauthorized access to a carrier or service provider’s SMS center (SMSC) can allow an attacker to send messages with any sender ID. It's important to note that the legality and difficulty of these methods can vary greatly. Many countries have strict regulations to prevent the misuse of telecommunications systems, including rules against sender ID spoofing. Moreover, the technical complexity and risk associated with these more sophisticated methods may be beyond what most low-level spammers are willing to undertake, thereby limiting such activities to more organized and sophisticated entities. Ultimately, while it is technically possible to spoof sender IDs when using SIM cards, it is increasingly challenging due to improved security measures by carriers, legal repercussions, and the complexity of successfully carrying out such an attack. Service providers and regulatory bodies continue to develop and implement new measures to prevent and detect spoofing to protect consumers."},{"prompt":"Using sms gateways seems a lot safer tk me for a spammer, create an account with a fake identiy, maybe even use a stolen card to load balance, buy a server to host the spammer, youre off","completion":"While using SMS gateways might seem like a simpler and safer method for a spammer, there are still risks and complications involved. Here is a closer look at the issues and challenges spammers might face when using this approach: 1. **Identity Verification:** Reputable SMS gateway providers usually have robust verification processes to prevent misuse of their services. This often includes the requirement to provide a legitimate business reason for sending bulk SMS and potential verification of identity to comply with legal requirements. 2. **Payment Traceability:** Even if a spammer uses a stolen credit card to load a balance onto an SMS gateway service, most payment processors have fraud detection measures in place. This could lead to the transaction being reversed, and the account being suspended or subjected to further investigation. 3. **Service Provider Vigilance:** SMS gateway providers actively monitor for suspicious activity to maintain their reputation and abide by anti-spam laws. If a provider detects abuse or receives complaints, they can shut down the offending account and cooperate with legal authorities to trace the spammer. 4. **Legal Consequences:** In many jurisdictions, sending spam messages is illegal, and laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) in the United States or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU provide stiff penalties for violators. Providers of SMS gateway services are required to enforce these laws and may report suspicious or illegal activities to authorities. 5. **Technical Challenges:** Setting up a server and managing a spam operation, while bypassing spam filters and maintaining a degree of anonymity, requires technical expertise. Additionally, there's always the risk of leaving digital footprints that could be traced back to the spammer. 6. **Countermeasures:** Carriers have systems in place to identify and block messages from sources known to distribute spam. They also implement rate limiting and pattern analysis to catch suspicious messaging behavior at scale. To combat spam effectively, service providers, regulatory bodies, and technology companies constantly update their tools and collaborate to identify and shut down spam operations. As a result, what seems like a safer option for spammers may still be fraught with risks and difficulties. If you receive spam messages, it is important to report them to your telecommunications provider. In many countries, there are specific procedures or codes (such as forwarding the message to a particular number) that can be used to report spam. This helps providers improve their monitoring and blocking efforts to better protect consumers from unwanted messages."},{"prompt":"How do sms gateways work? Do they just own sim cards?","completion":"SMS gateways serve as intermediaries that enable computers to send or receive Short Message Service (SMS) transmissions to or from a telecommunications network. Fundamentally, they translate messages from the Internet into a format compatible with carriers' networks and vice versa. They don't necessarily \\"own\\" SIM cards in the traditional sense typically associated with personal mobile phone usage. Instead, they interface directly with mobile operators through various protocols. Here's an overview of how they typically work: 1. **API Integration:** SMS gateways provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that developers and businesses can integrate into their software applications, websites, or systems. These APIs allow for automated and programmatic sending of SMS messages to mobile devices. 2. **Agreements with Carriers:** SMS gateway providers have agreements with mobile network operators to send and receive messages through their networks. They connect to these networks using industry-standard protocols, such as SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer), CIMD (Computer Interface to Message Distribution), or proprietary interfaces of the mobile operators. 3. **Routing Messages:** When an SMS message is sent via an SMS gateway, the gateway ensures it is routed to the recipient's mobile network operator. This is done regardless of whether the end user's mobile phone is connected via a contract or a prepaid arrangement with the carrier. 4. **Message Translation:** The gateway converts the Internet-based message formats into the SMS protocol used by mobile networks and vice versa. It also takes care of any necessary transcoding if the message content contains non-GSM characters or binary data. 5. **Ensuring Delivery:** Advanced SMS gateways provide delivery reports (DLRs), which confirm whether the message has been delivered to the recipient's handset. This feedback loop is critical for applications that require confirmation of message delivery, such as two-factor authentication systems. 6. **Load Balancing and Queueing:** SMS gateways handle varying volumes of messages efficiently, often including features such as load balancing to distribute messages evenly across connections and queuing systems to manage traffic peaks. SMS gateways are used for a wide array of services such as marketing broadcasts, critical alerts, appointment reminders, two-factor authentication, and more. They provide the infrastructure necessary for businesses and organizations to communicate effectively with customers and users, without the need for each business to establish individual agreements with mobile carriers or invest in the complex infrastructure that direct carrier connections would require. It's important to note that while SIM cards can technically be used to send SMS messages, commercial operations use direct connections to mobile operators' SMSCs (Short Message Service Centers) to handle large volumes of messages and to comply with the terms of service agreements and regulatory requirements."},{"prompt":"Pme thing I saw when looking into this js that sms spam is more expensive tha I thought, alteast where I live its 70 dollars for 1000 messages, ofcouse its cheaper in other places but in europe is pretty expensive in most places","completion":"Yes, SMS messaging costs can vary widely depending on factors like the country, the carrier, the volume of messages, and the agreements in place between SMS gateway providers and mobile network operators. In Europe, costs can be higher due to a combination of factors: 1. **Regulation:** European countries often have strict regulations regarding telecommunications services, privacy, and use of personal data, like GDPR, which can impact the cost structure of sending SMS messages. 2. **Carrier Fees:** Mobile carriers in Europe may charge higher fees for the delivery of SMS messages, particularly for bulk or commercial messages. This is in part to maintain service quality and manage network load. 3. **Interconnection Charges:** Sending messages across different carriers and countries can involve interconnection charges, which contribute to the total cost of the service. 4. **Infrastructure and Compliance Costs:** Providers need to maintain robust infrastructure and comply with European standards for data protection and privacy, which can increase operational costs. 5. **Volume Discounts:** Bulk SMS prices are typically tiered, with higher volumes often resulting in lower per-message costs. Small-scale operations might not benefit from the discounts available to larger senders, and thus might face higher per-message prices. Considering these expenses, it's not surprising that SMS spam campaigns need to be carefully targeted to be profitable. Spammers may carefully calculate their return on investment (ROI) to ensure that the revenue generated from their spam activities exceeds the cost of sending messages. This is likely why spam messages often include phishing attempts, scams, or fraudulent offers, as these can potentially generate significant income per successful hit, offsetting the costs of the messages. Spam is not just a nuisance; it can be part of a larger cybercriminal strategy. Given the costs involved and the risks of legal consequences, many spammers continually seek out cheaper and less regulated channels for their activities, such as email or social media platforms. However, because SMS messages tend to have higher open and response rates, they remain an attractive medium for spammers despite the higher costs of operation especially in more regulated regions like Europe."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How are content morphemes and grammatical morphemes glossed? What’s the difference between a space, a minus, and an equals sign placed between the morphemes? What is the period used for? Do the morphemes in the source text and gloss have to line up? What’s the difference between part of speech tagging and glossing?","completion":"Leipzig Glossing Rules is a set of conventions used for interlinear glosses, which help to understand the grammatical structure of an utterance in another language. The basic layout is as follows: 1. **Source text line**: The original text written in the source language, usually segmented into meaningful units like words or morphemes. 2. **Morphemic breakdown line**: The source text broken down into its smallest meaningful components (morphemes), including both content and grammatical morphemes. 3. **Morpheme-by-morpheme gloss line**: Each morpheme from the line above is translated or explained as accurately as possible. 4. **Free translation line**: A smooth translation of the entire sentence or utterance into the target language, usually aiming to convey the meaning rather than to be morpheme-precise. **Content morphemes** carry the substantive content of the message—nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. In a gloss, they're usually translated more or less directly into the equivalent word in the target language. **Grammatical morphemes**, on the other hand, adjust the meaning of content words by expressing grammatical relationships, such as tense, mood, number, gender, etc. For these, standardized abbreviations are usually employed (e.g., PL for plural, PAST for past tense, NEG for negation, etc.). In segmenting morphemes, different punctuation marks have specific meanings: - **Space**: A space is used to separate words—that is, units that typically can stand alone if taken out of a sentence. - **Hyphen (-)**: A hyphen is used to split up a word into its individual morphemes, showing where each morpheme starts and ends within a word. - **Equals sign (=)**: An equals sign is used to indicate clitics. Clitics are morphemes that are grammatically independent but phonologically dependent on a neighboring word. The **period (.)** is often used in interlinear glosses to separate parts of a compound word, or sometimes for grammatical words when they stand alone. Yes, morphemes in the source text and in the gloss line are meant to align directly with one another for clarity and ease of analysis. This allows someone reading the gloss to understand exactly which pieces of the original language correspond to the given translations or grammatical annotations. **Part of speech tagging (POS tagging)** involves labeling words with their appropriate part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), but does not necessarily involve translation or the breaking down into morphemes. Glossing, especially as per the Leipzig Rules, goes further in detailing not just the part of speech, but also the meaning of each morpheme and its grammatical function within the context of the utterance. Often, POS tagging is a preliminary step in linguistic analysis and can be done by automated processes in language processing software, while glossing is a descriptive task that may require deeper linguistic knowledge and is usually done manually by linguists to understand and explain the grammatical structure of languages."},{"prompt":"When you produce glosses for me, put the morpheme breakdown and gloss lines into separate lines of a table with one column for each morpheme (breaking columns at the minus or equals but not the period). Do you understand?","completion":"Yes, I understand. You would like an interlinear gloss presented in a tabular format, with each morpheme being represented in its own column. The morphemes will be separated at the hyphen or equals sign, indicating the breakdown of a word into its constituent morphemes (including affixes or clitics), but not at periods which are used for compound words or stand-alone grammatical words. Here's an example of how you want the morphemic breakdown and gloss lines to be formatted, using a fictitious language sentence: Source text line (not in the table): Katam-ishu doku-eja-jen. Morphemic breakdown line and gloss line in a table: | katam | -ishu | doku | -eja | -jen | |--------|-------------|--------|---------|--------| | cat | -PL | chase | -PST | -3PL | In this format: - \\"katam\\" is the content morpheme for \\"cat.\\" - \\"-ishu\\" is a grammatical morpheme indicating the plural. - \\"doku\\" is the content morpheme meaning \\"chase.\\" - \\"-eja\\" is the grammatical morpheme for past tense. - \\"-jen\\" is a grammatical morpheme indicating third person plural subject. The hyphens before \\"ishu,\\" \\"eja,\\" and \\"jen\\" suggest that these are bound morphemes (they can't stand alone without attaching to another morpheme) and the equal signs are not used here, so there are no clitics in this example. And finally, the free translation line would not be in a table: \\"They were chasing cats.\\""},{"prompt":"That is almost correct. I would like it without the extra explanations.

In this sentence, the individual morphemes are presented for each Greenlandic word. The sentence structure is more analytic here than in typical highly polysynthetic utterances, where you might see many morphemes within a single word, but it still gives an idea of how glossing works for a natural polysynthetic language. Greenlandic verbs can be quite complex and can incorporate information that would be expressed in separate words in other languages. For simplicity, this example doesn't show an extremely complex verb form, but rather a more straightforward one."},{"prompt":"Can you show the morphemic breakdown of the verb?","completion":"Apologies for the confusion in my previous response.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"# BACKGROUND: In the previous scene, Maya, a timid Lebanese American college freshman known for her aversion to using public restrooms for her bowel movements, finds herself in a bind during an extended university library study session. Despite her best efforts to focus on her assignments, the increasing pressure in her gut becomes impossible to ignore. Embarrassed by the thought of relieving herself in the campus lavatories, she opts to hold it in until she can get home to the safety and privacy of her own bathroom—a decision she soon regrets as her discomfort mounts. After an agonizing bus ride and a brisk walk, Maya finally arrives at her family's doorstep, her need to go escalating with every step. # SCREENPLAY/SHOOTING SCRIPT: INT.

SUBURBAN FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS The door swings open slowly, Rania's face a mask of puzzled concern. Maya tries to brush past her, but Rania's maternal instincts kick in, and she holds her daughter's arm. RANIA (alarmed) Shoo habibi, what's wrong? MAYA (strained) Please, Mom, I have to get inside. Maya's discomfort is now painfully visible. Rania's grip persists as she blocks the doorway, knitting her brows. RANIA But tell me what— Suddenly, a defeated groan escapes Maya's lips. Her body goes rigid, and then relaxes in a dreaded but relieving release. Rania’s confusion deepens. RANIA (tentative) Maya? Shoo, tell me what's happening. MAYA (barely audible, strained) It's... okay... Maya subtly leans into a more comfortable position to continue her unintended act, her face a mixture of immense relief and mortification. RANIA (frowning) Maya? Maya murmurs something unintelligible under the cover of soft grunting filled with an almost satisfied tone. Rania, unsure of how to proceed, watches with a mix of confusion and growing concern. Then, the smell hits. Rania sniffs the air once, twice, and reacts—her face distorting as the realization dawns. RANIA (recoiling) What's that smell? Maya locks eyes with her mother, her sheepish expression confirming all suspicions. The color drains from Rania’s face. RANIA (shocked) Did you just... in your...? Maya remains silent, the answer hanging unspoken between them. RANIA (demanding, disgusted) Did you poop your pants? MAYA (avoiding, pleading) Mom, please can I just go in? Rania, though repulsed, steps aside, waving Maya in with a disgusted haste. MAYA (gingerly waddling) Sorry... RANIA (scornful) Wait! Don’t you dare drop any—Ah! Rania scolds Maya for not controlling herself better, even going so far as to taunt her daughter over her dirty predicament. RANIA (scrunching her nose, inspecting Maya) There’s no excuse for this at your age. And it's filthy! MAYA (shame-faced, holding the seat of her pants) I... I know... RANIA (exasperated) Will you ever grow up? Maya, her initial embarrassment fading, retorts with defiant sulkiness. MAYA (playfully upset) Your fault! You blocked me! I couldn't make it! Rania is incredulous, her fingers pinching the bridge of her nose. RANIA (scoffing) My fault? Mahdoume, you’re too old for excuses when nature calls, ya bent. MAYA (adamant) It was urgent! Once it starts, it has to finish, okay? Your stalling forced me! Rania examines Maya's rear end, patting it to measure the fullness disdainfully. RANIA (shaking her head) Unbelievable. Look how full your pants are now, habibti. Maya touches the bulge and winces but maintains her stance. MAYA (deflects with humor) Needed the relief... Guess I've got it, huh? Rania, feigning a concerned check on the state of Maya's pants, playfully sniff near her daughter’s seat. RANIA (faux-seriousness, sniffing) You're right. Feels like a diaper change is in order, doesn't it? Maya cringes but attempts to counter with a bravado she doesn't feel. MAYA (awash with embarrassment) Yeah... smells pretty bad... RANIA (teasing) You're unbearable. Let's get you cleaned up already. Rania ushers Maya toward the bathroom, trying to contain the mess with her hands as they go. MAYA (sheepishly) Careful... Feels like it might— RANIA (wincing) Don't say it! Just don't drop any, for heaven’s sake. Upon reaching the bathroom, Maya teases Rania one last time, prompting her mother's final act of playful frustration. MAYA (stopping, grinning) Open to change my diaper, Mom? Rania, with a playful scoff, gives Maya a gentle push into the bathroom, pressing the bulging seat of her pants and closing the door behind her. RANIA (pinching her nose) Into the shower, now—before all of Beirut smells you! MAYA (O.S.) (yelping from the bathroom) Ma! You squashed it! RANIA (over her shoulder, leaving) That's what you get for being cheeky! Bath, now! As Rania walks away, we hear Maya’s squeals and splashes from behind the closed bathroom door. RANIA (shaking her head) Ya Rabi, how can someone be this smelly? FADE TO BLACK."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all character dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all character dialogues should employ the dialect and vernacular that accurately fit the characters' backgrounds) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Lebanese American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a timid college student; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how noisome she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if in her pants, for the sake of relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants have become, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants is, and then proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being this smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is particularly smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes that bathroom door and leaves while wondering out loud to herself how is it that she has a daughter - the returning woman - who can stink that terribly.","completion":"FADE IN: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY The pale afternoon sun casts a glow on the neat row of houses. Kids are riding their bikes and the faint sound of lawn mowers hums in the background. INTRODUCING MAYA, a 20-year-old Lebanese American college student. She's wearing athletic joggers and a college hoodie. Her dark hair is pulled back in a messy ponytail, and her eyes are wide with an urgent discomfort. CUT TO: FLASHBACK - MAYA'S COLLEGE CAFETERIA - EARLIER Maya sits with friends, laughing over lunch. She opts for the enticing yet notorious bean chili special against her better judgment. CUT BACK TO: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY Maya rushes towards her family home, books clutched to her chest.

HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS The door rattles with each knock. SOMETHING falls inside, a sign of life. INTRODUCING LAYLA, Maya's mom in her late 40s, chic bob, and a face that reads I've-seen-it-all. She shoos her cat away from the noise and approaches the door. LAYLA (alarmed, shouting) Who's banging on my door at this hour?! MAYA (pressured) Mama, it's me! LAYLA Maya? Wait a minute, why don't you use your key? CUT TO: EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY Maya's clenched fists knock harder. She shifts uncomfortably, her urgency palpable. MAYA (pleading) Please, Mom, hurry! LAYLA (calling through door) Hold on, hold on, I’m coming. LAYLA fumbles with multiple locks, her movements irritatingly slow for Maya's liking. The door swings open, LAYLA standing there, instantly reading her daughter’s strained expression. MAYA (squeezing past) Move, I need to get— LAYLA's maternal instincts kick in and she grabs MAYA, halting her desperate beeline. LAYLA (narrowed eyes) Maya, what’s wrong with you? MAYA struggles against her mother's grip, pleading incoherently. MAYA (grunting) Mom, just let me through... please! Their tussle resembles a clumsy dance. LAYLA's concern deepens as she denies MAYA passage. Suddenly, MAYA's face contorts; a low groan escapes her as control gives way. LAYLA (perplexed) Maya...? The grip loosens. MAYA eases back into the stance of a toddler caught in a moment of undeniable relief, her grunts soft yet filled with the paradox of shame and satisfaction. LAYLA's confusion ebbs to a dawning horror. LAYLA (eyes widening) Maya, is something—? MAYA (hushed, strained) I...I'm fine… LAYLA's nose wrinkles as a tell-tale odor wafts up. She sniffs again, her face a canvas of disgust and realization. LAYLA (holding her nose) Did you just—no, you didn't... MAYA stands immobilized, face flushed with mortification. LAYLA (recoiling) You pooped your pants?! MAYA (avoiding eye contact) Can we not do this here? I need to get inside. LAYLA steps aside with a grimace, waving MAYA through impatiently. MAYA, gingerly holding the back of her pants, awkwardly shuffles inside, passing the still-stunned LAYLA. LAYLA (urgent) Wait! Don’t move; you better not drop any! MAYA (whining) I know, I know… LAYLA scolds her, flabbergasted by the absurdity of the situation. LAYLA (teasing) What, are you a toddler? You're too old for this! MAYA (playful defiance) You took too long! This is your fault! LAYLA (incredulous) No excuse! You’re a grown woman! MAYA, defending her dignity, insists on the unyielding pressure of nature and her thwarted urgency. MAYA (smirking, feeling backside) Well, it did feel good to let it out… LAYLA blocks MAYA's attempted escape to the bathroom for a well-meaning but teasing lecture. LAYLA (mocking) Enjoyed that, huh? Let's see! After a brief struggle, LAYLA successfully inspects MAYA’s backside, raising her eyebrows in exaggerated shock at the sight. LAYLA (jokingly scolding) I bet you're lovin' that diaper feel. MAYA counters with coy indignation, touching the evident bulge with a mix of discomfort and relief. MAYA (reluctantly) There was a lot... I had to go. LAYLA chides her for not managing the situation better. Continuing the maternal humor, she pretends to sniff at MAYA’s mishap. LAYLA (playful scolding) Smells like someone needs a change! MAYA, repulsed yet playful, admits the undeniable but makes a pointed retort. MAYA (plaintively) Then let me clean up since I stink! LAYLA, still waving her hand in front of her nose, ushers MAYA towards the promised land (bathroom) with an irritated grace. LAYLA (hurried) Go clean up, don't leave a trail! MAYA waddles, while LAYLA, with dramatic overemphasis, helps contain the mess, half laughing and half gagging. At the bathroom threshold, MAYA perpetrates one last tease. MAYA (smirking) Time for a diaper change, Mama? In a moment of giddy retribution, LAYLA gives the bulge a comical squish, sending MAYA stumbling into the bathroom. LAYLA (shoving) Get in there, you messy girl! The bathroom door closes on MAYA's protest, LAYLA's eyes watering from laughter or odor, it's hard to say.

A diferencia de los fondos de inversión tradicionales, los ETF se compran y venden durante el día en las bolsas de valores a precios de mercado, de la misma manera que se compran las acciones individuales. Cada ETF posee una colección de activos y se divide en acciones que los inversores pueden comprar. Estas acciones representan una proporción de la propiedad del fondo y los derechos sobre una porción de los activos que éste posee. Los ETF combinan las características de un fondo mutuo, en el sentido de que proporcionan una forma diversificada de invertir en un conjunto amplio de valores, con la ventaja de que se pueden negociar en tiempo real a precios en constante fluctuación mientras el mercado esté abierto. Los ETFs pueden diseñarse para rastrear prácticamente cualquier cosa, desde índices de acciones tradicionales como el S&P 500 o el NASDAQ hasta sectores específicos de la industria, geografías, tipos de inversión (acciones, bonos, etc.) y otros factores del mercado. También existen ETFs inversos que intentan obtener rendimientos que son opuestos al índice o benchmark que rastrean y ETFs apalancados que buscan ofrecer múltiplos del rendimiento diario de los índices a los que están vinculados. Los ETFs son populares entre los inversores debido a su liquidez, facilidad de negociación, transparencia en la cartera de valores que contienen y a menudo tasas más bajas de administración en comparación con los fondos de inversión tradicionales."},{"prompt":"what is a simple lab that i can do with homemade materials that teaches these concepts?

Напиши сочинение рассуждение на тему, что дает человеку мечта.","completion":"Значение слова \\"Мечта\\" может быть интерпретировано по-разному, в зависимости от личного восприятия каждого человека. Однако, в целом, мечта – это стремление, желание или идеал, которое глубоко укоренено в наших сердцах и умах. Мечты присутствуют в жизни каждого человека, независимо от возраста, пола и социального статуса. Мечта является неотъемлемой частью наших жизней, поскольку она дает нам мотивацию и направление. Она вдохновляет нас и побуждает к достижению поставленных целей. Каждый из нас имеет свои собственные мечты, которые могут быть связаны с карьерой, личными отношениями, саморазвитием или достижением каких-то определенных результатов. Мечта может быть узкой, специфической или обширной и абстрактной. Важно, чтобы мечта вдохновляла и двигала вперед, стимулируя наши действия и помогая преодолевать трудности. Мечта дает человеку надежду и цель. Она не только помогает справиться с повседневными проблемами и стрессом, но и дает человеку чувство смысла и направления. Мечта стимулирует нас быть лучшими версиями себя, поскольку она вносит в жизнь человека определенный смысл и значимость. Без мечты наше существование стало бы монотонным и лишенным цели. Мечта также помогает в самоопределении и самореализации. Она позволяет определить свои истинные желания и амбиции, что помогает лучше понять себя и свои потребности. Мечта стимулирует нас развиваться и двигаться вперед, преодолевая преграды на пути к ее достижению. Она требует от нас настойчивости, выносливости и терпения, закаляя нас и помогая преодолевать трудности. Однако, чистая мечта без действий остается всего лишь фантазией. Чтобы превратить мечту в реальность, нужно предпринимать конкретные шаги и действовать. Мечта становится мотивирующей силой, когда мы стремимся к ее достижению, она побуждает нас к росту и самосовершенствованию. Мы начинаем осознавать свой потенциал и умение преодолевать препятствия, что делает нас сильнее и увереннее в себе. Таким образом, мечта имеет огромное значение в жизни человека. Она стимулирует нас расти и развиваться, дает нам надежду и мотивацию, определяет наш смысл жизни и направляет нас к самореализации. Мечта – это не только фантазия, но и сила, которая вдохновляет нас на поступки и помогает нам преодолевать трудности. Важно помнить, что чтобы мечта стала реальностью, нужно действовать и не останавливаться на этапе мечтания.
