However, some general patterns have been observed in the medical literature regarding the location of the hemorrhage and the risk of seizures. 1. **Cerebral Cortex (Cortex)** - The risk of seizures is generally higher when the hemorrhage involves the cerebral cortex, particularly the frontal and temporal lobes. Seizures may occur in approximately 30-60% of patients with cortical involvement, with the risk of delayed seizures being higher in the temporal lobe. 2. **Temporal Lobe** - Due to the temporal lobe's high epileptogenic potential, delayed seizures might occur in up to 30-50% of cases with involvement in this area. 3. **Frontal Lobe** - The frontal lobe is less epileptogenic than the temporal lobe, but hemorrhages here can still lead to delayed seizures in approximately 20-40% of cases. 4. **Parietal and Occipital Lobes** - These regions are generally less associated with seizure generation compared to the temporal and frontal lobes. The incidence of delayed seizures may be lower, around 10-30%. 5. **Subcortical Regions (such as the Thalamus and Basal Ganglia)** - The risk of seizures is generally considered to be lower with subcortical hemorrhages compared to cortical hemorrhages. The incidence of delayed seizures may range from approximately 5-20%. 6. **Cerebellum and Brainstem** - Seizures are relatively rare from hemorrhages in these locations due to their primary roles in coordination and autonomic function rather than higher cognitive functions associated with seizures. It is important to note that these are rough estimates, and individual studies may report different ranges of incidence. Factors that can influence the likelihood of delayed seizures following a hemorrhagic stroke include the size of the hemorrhage, the extent of secondary injury such as edema and inflammation, patient age, medical history, and genetic predispositions to seizures. Because the brain is highly interconnected, the impact of a hemorrhage isn't limited to the immediate area of bleeding. The irritation or damage to nearby tissue and pathways can also contribute to the development of seizures, making it challenging to predict outcomes based solely on the hemorrhage location. Additionally, elderly patients may have a different risk profile due to the presence of co-morbidities, changes in brain structure and function with aging, and differences in the brain's response to injury and repair mechanisms. As always, individual patient care should be based on a thorough evaluation by a medical professional, and these statistics should serve as a guide rather than a definitive prediction of outcomes."},{"prompt":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 180 characters.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","completion":"애플 비전 프로는 최고의 소비자 헤드셋이지만, 그것이 문제다. 현실을 증강시키려는 엄청난 야망에도 불구하고, 무거운 무게, 외부장치 배터리, 현실과의 괴리감 등 무시할 수 없는 트레이드오프가 있다."},{"prompt":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 180 characters.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","completion":"애플 비전 프로는 최고의 VR 헤드셋이나, 무거우며 실제와 차이가 있음.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","completion":"애플 비전 프로는 최신 VR 기술이나 무거워 사용에 제약이 있음. 완벽한 AR는 아직 아님."},{"prompt":"Read the article below and summarize the key takeaways in 60 characters.

Mountains where Thunderbirds create terrible storms"},{"prompt":"which one do you think is the scariest","completion":"Determining the scariest setting from the lists provided is quite subjective and largely depends on what particular type of fear resonates most with an individual. For some, psychological horror may be the most terrifying, combining a sense of reality with the terror of losing one's mind. In this case, settings under \\"Psychological Terrors\\" such as a dream therapy clinic with unintended side effects or an apartment with walls that whisper secrets could be particularly chilling. However, if we consider universally evocative fears such as fear of the unknown, isolation, and darkness, then settings that combine these elements may be deemed the scariest. \\"Subterranean Dangers\\" encapsulates all these fears, with an underground setting evoking a primal claustrophobia and the darkness obscuring unknown horrors lurking just out of sight. An example from this category would be \\"Underground catacombs filled with the remains of the dead,\\" which not only stirs fears of confinement and darkness but also touches on the fear of death and the supernatural. On the other hand, \\"Otherwordly Invasions\\" with the premise of alien or interdimensional threats can spark a deep-rooted fear owing to the vastness of the unknown and the feeling of vulnerability against a superior and potentially hostile force. A small town being slowly overtaken by aliens is a setting that combines the terror of invasion with the eerie transformation of the familiar into something alien and threatening. Ultimately, the scariest setting is the one that most effectively exploits the reader's or audience's personal fears, cultural anxieties, and taps into the uncanny - the displacement of the familiar into something foreboding and strange."},{"prompt":"what would a virgo rising person find most scary>?","completion":"Astrologically, Virgo Rising individuals are known for their attention to detail, strong sense of responsibility, and practical nature. These characteristics can give us insight into the types of settings and scenarios that might particularly unsettle someone with Virgo Rising in their birth chart. Here are a few settings with explanations on why a Virgo Rising might find them scary: 1. **Clinical Horror** - As creatures of habit and order, Virgo Risings might find settings like \\"Closed-down psychiatric hospitals\\" or \\"Research laboratories conducting unethical experiments\\" especially disturbing for their association with chaos and loss of control, as well as the perversion of medical and analytical endeavors. 2. **Twisted Science** - This category features settings like \\"AI development labs that achieved sentience\\" or \\"Genetic labs where specimens have broken free.\\" Virgo Risings might find these scenarios horrifying because they represent a breakdown in the logical, ordered process and the potential consequences of overstepping ethical boundaries. 3. **Bizarre Experiments** - Scenarios such as \\"Underground government facilities with unethical testing\\" highlight the fear of having one’s autonomy violated and being subjected to inhumane treatment, which is directly in opposition to a Virgo Rising's value on respect and meticulous care. 4. **Psychological Terrors** - An example from this category is \\"Institutions where patients' fears become reality.\\" Virgo Risings, who are often concerned with mental prowess and control, could find the idea of losing grip on reality and succumbing to their innermost fears particularly nightmarish. 5. **Supernatural Phenomena** - Settings such as \\"Bridges where the veil between worlds is thin\\" or \\"Crypts beneath religious buildings with ungodly secrets\\" could play against Virgo Rising’s preference for the tangible and explicable, making the supernatural a source of profound discomfort. 6. **Unnatural Disasters** - Scenarios such as \\"Tornado-stricken towns with bizarre aftereffects\\" could be threatening to Virgo Rising's need for structure in their environment and an inherent distaste for disorder and unpredictability. 7. **Cursed Places** - Settings like \\"Antique stores with possessed objects\\" may be particularly unsettling to Virgo Rising individuals because they represent a disruption of the normal, everyday places they may find themselves, along with a contamination of the purity and functionality they value. 8. **Religious Dread** - Being exposed to disturbing, twisted forms of spirituality, as in \\"Churches where prayers become curses,\\" might deeply unsettle a Virgo Rising person, who typically looks for genuineness and honesty in such sacred spaces. 9. **Industrial Decay** - The environments such as \\"Toxic waste dumps\\" or \\"Derelict dockyards\\" would be particularly distressing for a Virgo Rising who values cleanliness, health, and environmental order. 10. **Haunted Locations** - A setting like an \\"Abandoned asylum\\" might play on a Virgo Rising’s anxiety about mental health and the historical mistreatment of the vulnerable, and a concern for any lingering turmoil. Importantly, this analysis relies heavily on astrological stereotypes and might not represent every Virgo Rising individual's personal fears, as personal experiences and individual differences will always play a key role in what a person finds scary."},{"prompt":"GPT","completion":"GPT stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer. It's a type of language model developed by OpenAI. Essentially, it uses machine learning algorithms to analyze, understand, and generate human-like text based on the input it receives.

The \\"E\\" in the classification indicates that it is an elliptical galaxy, while the \\"7\\" denotes a strong bar feature. The \\"S2\\" indicates that it has moderately tightly wound spiral arms. Barred spiral galaxies like the Milky Way often have a central bar-shaped structure that extends through the galaxy's core. These bars are thought to play a key role in the dynamics of the galaxy, influencing the movement of stars and gas within it.

Bulgeless irregular galaxies are often characterized by their chaotic and asymmetrical appearance, with no defined structure in the form of spiral arms or a central bulge. They can contain regions of active star formation and may have a more patchy distribution of gas, dust, and young stars throughout their disk.

Diskless elliptical galaxies, also known as boxy or round ellipticals, have a smooth and featureless appearance without prominent spiral arms or a defined disk component. Instead, they typically have a more symmetric and rounded shape, with stars distributed evenly throughout the galaxy. These galaxies often exhibit a high concentration of older stars and little ongoing star formation activity. The presence of a strong bar feature in an E7Snon-type galaxy may indicate some level of dynamical activity in its central region, influencing the movement of stars within the galaxy.

Honestly, she has been very manipulating and tries to make me stay to pay rent for her house and leave me in the living room to sleep while my other sibling pays no rent and has a room all to herself","completion":"I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this challenging situation with your mom. It sounds like you're facing some difficult family dynamics and maybe experiencing emotional manipulation. Here are some steps you can take to address this situation: 1. Set Boundaries: It's important to set healthy boundaries to protect your mental and emotional well-being. If your mother's behavior is causing you distress, it may be time to assert some limits on what you will and won't accept. This may be difficult, but it is essential for your self-respect. 2. Communicate: Try to have an open and honest conversation with your mom about how you feel. Use \\"I\\" statements to avoid putting her on the defensive (e.g., \\"I feel hurt when I'm not treated equally regarding rent and living space\\"). 3. Seek Support: Reach out to friends, other family members, or a mental health professional who can provide you with emotional support and guidance. 4. Financial Independence: Work towards financial independence, if you haven't already. Being financially independent can give you the freedom to make decisions about where and how you live without being manipulated. 5. Living Arrangements: Consider whether you can change your living situation. If paying rent and not having a room is causing undue stress, it may be worth exploring other housing options where you will have more autonomy and be treated more fairly. 6. Take Time: Family relationships can be complex, and sometimes taking some time apart can be beneficial. You might find that some distance can help both you and your mother gain perspective on your relationship. 7. Professional Help: Consider seeking the help of a family therapist or mediator to help navigate and address the issues in your relationship with your mom in a safe and constructive environment. 8. Prioritize Your Well-being: Remember that your health and well-being must be your top priority. If staying in your current situation is harming you, it's important to prioritize your needs and consider making a change. It's crucial to protect your mental and emotional health during such a challenging time. If the situation between you and your mother does not improve or is causing significant distress, seeking external support is very important. Family therapy could be an option if your mother is willing to participate, but individual counseling could also provide you with tools and strategies to cope with your situation."},{"prompt":"Shared library in jenkins","completion":"In Jenkins, a \\"shared library\\" refers to a set of reusable Groovy scripts that you can share across multiple Jenkins pipeline jobs. It's like a library of custom steps or methods that can be used to define common functionality or logic and avoid duplicating code across different Jenkinsfile or pipeline scripts. The shared library is defined externally to the jobs themselves, usually in a source code repository (like a Git repository). Once defined, it can be configured in the Jenkins system and then imported into any Jenkins pipeline job to use the functions or classes it defines. To set up a shared library, you will need to follow these general steps: 1. Write the shared library code: Write Groovy scripts to encapsulate the common functionality you want to provide. These should be structured according to the expected directory structure (see step 2). 2. Organize the shared library structure: Jenkins expects a specific directory structure for shared libraries: \`\`\` (root) +- src # Groovy source files | +- org | +- foo | +- Bar.groovy # for org.foo.Bar class | +- vars | +- myStep.groovy # for global 'myStep' variable | +- myStep.txt # help for 'myStep' variable | +- resources # resource files (non-Groovy files) +- org +- foo +- bar.json # static helper data for org.foo.Bar \`\`\` \`src\` contains reusable Groovy code. \`vars\` contains global variables that can be called from pipeline scripts. \`resources\` contains non-Groovy files that can be loaded by the Groovy classes, such as templates or configuration files. 3. Host the shared library in a version control system (VCS): Commit your shared library to a VCS like Git so that Jenkins can retrieve it. 4. Configure Jenkins to use the shared library: - Go to \\"Manage Jenkins\\" > \\"Configure System\\" in the Jenkins UI. - Find the \\"Global Pipeline Libraries\\" section and add the shared library, specifying the name you'll reference it by, its source code repository location, and which versions to use (branches, tags, etc.). 5. Import the shared library into your Jenkinsfile: In your Jenkins pipeline script (typically \`Jenkinsfile\`), you can then import and use the library with the \`@Library\` annotation or by using the \`library\` step. For example: \`\`\`groovy @Library('my-shared-library') _ pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { steps { // Call a function from the shared library myStep() } } } } \`\`\` or \`\`\`groovy library('my-shared-library') pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { steps { // Call a function from the shared library myStep() } } } } \`\`\` Please keep in mind that Jenkins needs to have proper access rights to the repository hosting the shared library. Additionally, Jenkins administrators can enable and configure shared libraries to be implicitly available to all pipelines, easing the overhead of importing them into every \`Jenkinsfile\`. Shared libraries are a powerful way to create a robust, maintainable, and reusable set of pipeline steps in Jenkins, helping teams to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in their CI/CD processes."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As of my last update, the semiconductor industry is manufacturing processors with features sizes as small as 5 nm and has plans to push towards 3 nm and potentially even 2 nm nodes. The limits are determined by various factors, including the physics of how transistors operate at very small scales and the manufacturing technologies available. Quantum mechanical effects, such as quantum tunneling, become more significant as features sizes decrease, potentially interfering with the operation of conventional silicon-based transistors. Moreover, photolithography, the technique traditionally used to etch circuits onto silicon, is limited by the wavelength of light used. The advent of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) has pushed the boundary further, but there is still a limit to how small features can be before traditional lithography techniques fail to be practical or effective. There is speculation about alternative materials like graphene or carbon nanotubes, or new transistor designs like Tunnel FETs (Field-Effect Transistors) that could potentially bypass some of the limitations of silicon. Quantum computing is another field that could redefine computational limits, albeit in a fundamentally different way than traditional transistor scaling. If we reach a point where it is no longer possible to shrink the feature sizes of individual transistors, further improvements would need to come from other innovations such as 3D stacking, improving processor architectures, new materials, and more efficient use of transistors. In terms of a hard theoretical limit, there are various opinions among experts. Some believe that features could potentially be reduced down to a few nanometers across—perhaps as low as 1 nm, which is just a few atoms wide—before the principles of conventional transistor operation fail. However, this is speculative and would require significant breakthroughs in material science and nanotechnology to become a reality."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

E7S2 galaxies are elliptical (E) in shape, with a prominent central bulge and slightly flattened disk. They also exhibit some signs of spiral structure (S2), with faint spiral arms or dust lanes visible in the disk. E7S2 galaxies are often considered intermediate between elliptical and spiral galaxies, combining some features of both types. They are typically older and more evolved galaxies, with little ongoing star formation and a population of older stars. E7S2 galaxies are less common than pure elliptical or spiral galaxies, making up a small fraction of the galaxy population. Their unique combination of features makes them an interesting and important object of study for astronomers trying to understand the evolution and formation of galaxies."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In the case of smart quotes being automatically replaced, several potential causes could exist: 1. **Input Sanitization:** The Gradio application or backend code may sanitize inputs to avoid execution of malicious code or to standardize the dataset. This process might convert smart quotes to their corresponding HTML entities or escape them, which could result in their replacement upon display. 2. **Frontend Code:** The JavaScript code in the frontend could have functions that format or manipulate the strings entered by the user or returned by the chatbot. Functions that process text, such as those that escape or unescape HTML entities, might replace smart quotes with straight ones. 3. **Backend Processing:** The backend AI model (e.g., deployed on OpenAI's servers) might be configured to standardize quotes for consistency in training data or output format. The code responsible for this wouldn't be visible in the HTML/CSS/JavaScript content provided since it resides on the server. 4. **Browser Behavior:** Some browsers automatically convert straight quotes to smart quotes when entering text in form fields, based on specific language or keyboard settings. This could be something that the chat application is compensating for by standardizing the quotes on display. 5. **CSS/Font Rendering:** In some cases, the way quotes appear can be affected by the CSS styling or the font used. If a particular font renders quotes as smart quotes by default, it could appear as though there's an automatic replacement when, in fact, it’s just a font display feature. From the provided HTML content, it's not possible to identify a specific point in the code that would be causing this replacement. Typically, such behavior would be defined in the JavaScript files that process the submissions of the chat and determine how inputs are handled, formatted, or displayed. To investigate this further, one would need to review the actual JavaScript event handlers and backend processing code which controls the behavior of the chatbot interface."},{"prompt":"just telling to you in this specific chat of that code above that you are constantly replacing everything to smart quotes, even code outputs which renders it illegal due the fact that there should be straight quotes strictly in code. now try understand on that code why it could happen. analyze that chat code normally.","completion":"Based on the HTML provided and considering the behavior you've described, where smart quotes are replacing straight quotes even in code outputs, the issue might be related to the text processing on the frontend or the server-side. I can see that there are \`divs\` for the chat messages marked with \`data-testid=\\"bot\\"\` and \`data-testid=\\"user\\"\` that contain code and text outputs. However, the full backend logic responsible for this transformation is not visible in the HTML snippet, as that would be on the server-side (OpenAI's API in this case) or in external JavaScript files not included in the provided code. It's essential to understand that HTML provided doesn't contain any logic processing the messages. Any replacements taking place must be occurring through JavaScript functions or on the server that interprets the chat messages. Given this scenario, let's check a few potential sources of the issue: 1. **Server-side Processing**: If the chatbot is an AI model like GPT-3 or GPT-4, the server-side software might be returning responses with smart quotes. This could be part of the natural language processing that aims to make the language appear more natural or human-like by using typographically correct quotes. 2. **JavaScript String Handling**: If there are JavaScript functions processing the text before displaying them, look for any methods that might be converting straight quotes into smart quotes deliberately. This could be part of a text formatting function intending to \\"beautify\\" the output, but inadvertently affecting code snippets as well. 3. **Content-Type Rendering**: If the MIME type of the document is being set to \`text/plain\` or another non-HTML type, smart quote conversion would typically not be expected. However, for \`text/html\`, browsers sometimes beautify the text by converting straight quotes in regular text nodes to smart quotes based on language and locale settings. 4. **CSS**: Some fonts or CSS might cause quotes to appear as smart quotes purely as a rendering feature. This would mean that the underlying text actually has straight quotes, but they just look like smart quotes. 5. **Input Element Attributes**: HTML input elements have attributes like \`accept-charset\`, which could cause the browser to transform input characters, including quotes, depending on the character set being accepted. From the information provided, it's not possible to pinpoint the exact cause as the actual processing and transformation mechanics are not visible. To debug the issue properly, one would need access to: - The JavaScript files that manage the chatbot's responses. - The server-side processing code (API calls to OpenAI's server where transformations might be enforced). - Input handling code within the frontend. - The configurations for any WYSIWYG editors or input fields if used, which might have settings related to quote transformations. A closer examination of these aspects would be necessary to determine why smart quotes are replacing straight quotes even within code outputs."},{"prompt":"the problem that JavaScript is huge and it splitted in chunks","completion":"When dealing with a large JavaScript codebase that's been split into chunks, as seen in modern web applications, troubleshooting specific issues can be challenging. These are some steps one can take to investigate and hopefully determine why straight quotes might be automatically replaced with smart quotes in the chat messages: 1. **Inspect the Network Activity:** Open the browser's Developer Tools, look under the Network tab, and inspect the XHR (XMLHttpRequest) or Fetch responses when chat messages are sent and received. This can show the raw response data from the server and help determine if the replacement is happening server-side or client-side. 2. **Search the Codebase:** If you have access to the code before it's bundled, you can search for functions that might be manipulating text. Look for methods like \`replace()\`, \`replaceAll()\`, or any other string manipulation functions that could be changing quotes. They may be part of a sanitization or formatting library. 3. **Static Analysis Tools:** Use linting tools or code editors with advanced search features to scan through the code for potentially problematic patterns, such as regex expressions that might be replacing quotes. 4. **Client-Side Debugging:** Set breakpoints in the developers' console in areas where chat messages are handled. You can monitor variables and watch expressions as they change to see where the conversion might occur. 5. **Disable JavaScript Minification:** If the code you're inspecting is minified, try to locate an unminified version of the code, or use source maps within Developer Tools to see the original source code that corresponds to the bundled and minified code. 6. **Review Message Handling Code:** Find the code responsible for crafting and displaying chat messages. This will likely involve tracing back from the DOM elements with \`data-testid\` values \\"bot\\" and \\"user\\". You can modify the HTML to add breakpoint attributes like \`onclick=\\"debugger;\\"\` to catch the exact moment when innerHTML is altered. 7. **API Documentation:** Check the official documentation for the OpenAI API (or any other AI model you are using) to see if there are any notes on text formatting or character replacements. 8. **Server-Side Code:** If possible, inspect the server code or configurations that determine how the AI model processes and returns text. Look for any string formatting that occurs before the response is sent to the frontend. 9. **Community and Support Channels:** If you're using a third-party API or library (like Gradio with OpenAI), there may be community forums, GitHub issues, or support channels where this issue has been discussed or documented. By performing these investigative steps, you should be able to gain insights into where and why the text is being altered. These steps are reasonably standard when working with modern web applications that utilize dynamic code splitting and have complex interactions between the client-side and server-side environments."},{"prompt":"what unicode codes for these quotes?: “”","completion":"The Unicode codes for the double curly quotes “” (also known as smart quotes, typographic quotes, or curly quotes) are: - Left double quotation mark “ : U+201C - Right double quotation mark ” : U+201D To use them in HTML, you can use the corresponding HTML entities: - Left double quotation mark “ : \`&ldquo;\` or \`&#8220;\` - Right double quotation mark ” : \`&rdquo;\` or \`&#8221;\`"},{"prompt":"searching now in this chat javascript","completion":"It seems that within the provided HTML content, the JavaScript code has been minified and compiled into separate chunks, making it difficult to inspect directly for any mention of smart quote replacements. Unfortunately, the actual JavaScript code blocks responsible for potentially converting straight quotes to smart quotes are not included in the snippet you've provided. In order to locate where in the JavaScript smart quotes might be handled, you would need to search through the JavaScript files that have been loaded into the application. You mentioned that the JavaScript is extensive and split into chunks, which is typical in modern web applications that employ code-splitting for performance optimization. To search through the JavaScript for code that might be handling quote replacement: 1. **Use Developer Tools:** Access the \\"Sources\\" tab in your browser’s developer tools. You can look at the list of script files that are loaded and examine them. If source maps are available, you can view the original source code structure even if the files are minified. 2. **Search for Character Codes:** Use the developer tools' search feature (often accessed by pressing \`Ctrl + F\` or \`Cmd + F\` within the \\"Sources\\" tab) to look for the character codes \`U+201C\` and \`U+201D\`, or their HTML entity counterparts \`&ldquo;\` and \`&rdquo;\`. 3. **Network Tab:** Check the Network tab as the page loads to see the JavaScript files being fetched. Sometimes, the files have descriptive names that can give you hints about their contents, even if they are minified. 4. **Review Bundled Code:** Look for sections in the JavaScript bundles that deal with text formatting, input/output processing, or chat functionality. It's likely that the quote replacement logic would be located in functions related to these areas. 5. **Check for String Replacement Logic:** If you can access the full script files, use global search functionality in your code editor to look for string methods like \`.replace()\`, regex expressions, or other potential code that could convert straight quotes into smart quotes. 6. **Disable Minification Locally:** If you have access to the build process, you could build a non-minified version of the application locally to make the code more human-readable. Keep in mind that the issue might not be purely related to static replacement logic in the JavaScript. It could involve dynamic content processing by the server, especially since the chat response in question would be generated by an AI model like GPT-3 or GPT-4, and that code wouldn’t reside in the JavaScript files."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ecco una guida passo passo su come potresti procedere, ma ti ricordo che se non ti senti a tuo agio con il lavoro elettrico sull'auto, potrebbe essere meglio lasciare questa operazione a un meccanico professionista. Passo 1: Preparazione - Assicurati che il motore sia spento e che la chiave non sia nell'avviamento. - Apri il portellone posteriore per accedere all'interruttore del portellone. Passo 2: Trova l'interruttore del portellone - L'interruttore del portellone si trova solitamente vicino al meccanismo di chiusura del portellone stesso; potrebbe essere nascosto da una copertura di plastica o situato in un'area accessibile. Passo 3: Prepara il multimetro - Imposta il multimetro su misurazione di tensione continua (Volt DC). Passo 4: Localizza i fili dell'interruttore - Identifica i fili che vanno all'interruttore; ci dovrebbero essere almeno due fili. Passo 5: Accedi ai fili dell'interruttore - Se necessario, scollega il connettore dell'interruttore per accedere ai fili. Questo può richiedere di sollevare piccole clip o di sganciare un connettore di sicurezza. Passo 6: Misura la tensione - Con l'interruttore scollegato, tocca con la sonda del multimetro (+) il filo di alimentazione (tipicamente rosso o con una striscia positiva) e con l'altra sonda (-) tocca una parte metallica ben pulita del telaio dell'auto per fare massa. - Chiedi a un assistente di accendere la chiave di accensione (senza avviare il motore) per attivare il circuito elettrico. Passo 7: Verifica la lettura del multimetro - Se il circuito è alimentato correttamente, dovresti vedere una lettura positiva sul multimetro, generalmente intorno ai 12 volt. Se non c'è lettura, potrebbe esserci un problema con l'alimentazione elettrica, come un fusibile bruciato, una connessione sciolta o un interruttore difettoso. Se ti risulta ci sia corrente e l'interruttore ancora non funziona, l'interruttore stesso potrebbe essere guasto. Se non c'è corrente, potrebbe essere necessario controllare il fusibile corrispondente o i cablaggi per eventuali problemi. Ricorda sempre di lavorare con cautela quando si maneggiano i componenti elettrici dell'auto. Se non sei sicuro delle procedure o delle tecniche di sicurezza, è sempre meglio consultare un professionista."},{"prompt":"Quindi non devo toccare entrambi i fili con il tester?","completion":"Mi scuso per la confusione. In effetti, durante la misurazione della tensione, non dovresti toccare contemporaneamente entrambi i fili con un singolo tester impostato per misurare la tensione, poiché ciò potrebbe causare un cortocircuito. Ecco come dovresti misurare la tensione agli estremi dell'interruttore del portellone: 1. **Prepara il Multimetro**: Imposta il multimetro per misurare la tensione continua (V DC). 2. **Accedi ai Filo dell'Interruttore**: Individua i fili che arrivano all'interruttore del portellone e accedi ad essi, eventualmente scollegando il connettore se l’interruttore è collegato tramite uno. Sii gentile e fai attenzione a non danneggiare i connettori o i fili. 3. **Trova un Punto di Messa a Terra**: Trova un punto metallico non verniciato sulla carrozzeria o sul telaio dell'auto da utilizzare come terra per il multimetro. 4. **Misura la Tensione dell’Alimentazione**: - Colloca una sonda del multimetro (rosso, positivo) sul terminale del filo che presumibilmente fornisce la tensione positiva all’interruttore (di solito rosso o con una striscia colorata indicante il polo positivo). - Colloca l'altra sonda (nero, negativo) sul punto di massa che hai identificato sul telaio o sulla carrozzeria dell'auto. 5. **Attiva il Circuito**: Chiedi ad un assistente di inserire la chiave di accensione (senza avviare il motore) per attivare il circuito del portellone. 6. **Verifica la Lettura**: - Osserva il display del tester per la lettura della tensione. Se vedi una lettura di circa 12 volt (o la tensione nominale della batteria dell'auto), allora c'è tensione che arriva all'interruttore. - Se non vedi alcuna lettura, potrebbe significare che non c'è tensione che arriva all’interruttore, a causa di problemi come un fusibile bruciato, un relè guasto, un cablaggio difettoso, o problemi con l'alimentazione elettrica. Se rilevi correttamente la tensione all'interruttore, ma il portellone non funziona come dovrebbe, l'interruttore stesso potrebbe essere guasto. Se non rilevi tensione, dovrai continuare la diagnosi procedendo con il controllo dei collegamenti relativi fino alla fonte (fusibile, relè, e unità di controllo se presente). Ricorda sempre di lavorare con sicurezza, soprattutto con sistemi elettrici. Se non sei a tuo agio con queste operazioni, o se il problema persiste, ti consiglio di contattare un professionista o un elettrauto."},{"prompt":"Se mettessi il puntale sull filo negativo e l'altro a massa cosaysuvvederebbe?","completion":"Se posizioni una sonda del tester sul filo negativo (o neutro) dell'interruttore e l'altra sonda la metti a massa (su un punto metallico non verniciato del veicolo che fa contatto diretto con il telaio o la carrozzeria), il multimetro configurato per misurare tensione continua dovrebbe mostrare una lettura molto vicina a zero. Questo perché sia il filo negativo (o neutro) dell'interruttore che il punto di massa a cui vai a toccare dovrebbero avere lo stesso potenziale elettrico, ovvero quello della terra del veicolo. Tuttavia, in alcuni casi potresti ottenere una piccola lettura di tensione se c'è resistenza nei collegamenti a terra o c'è un problema con la massa del veicolo, come una connessione arrugginita o allentata. Questo potrebbe indicare che il ritorno a terra non è efficiente come dovrebbe essere. È importante notare che, in un sistema elettrico funzionante, non dovrebbe esserci tensione significativa tra un filo neutro (o filo di ritorno) e la massa del veicolo; la loro funzione primaria è di completare il circuito permettendo il ritorno dell'elettricità alla fonte. Mentre testi, assicurati che il collegamento alla parte del telaio o della carrozzeria sia buono, perché una cattiva connessione potrebbe darti letture inaffidabili."},{"prompt":"Dovrebbero esserci solo 2 fili?","completion":"In molti interruttori, compresi quelli per sistemi semplici come un interruttore del portellone, è comune avere due fili collegati. Uno è per l'alimentazione (+) e l'altro per il ritorno a terra (-). Quando l'interruttore è chiuso (attivato), si completa il circuito permettendo il passaggio di corrente e attivando la funzione per cui è stato progettato, ad esempio per illuminare la luce del bagagliaio o per segnalare che il portellone è aperto. Tuttavia, in alcuni sistemi più complessi o per alcuni tipi di sensori, potrebbero esserci più dei due fili tipici. Ad esempio, potrebbero esserci aggiunti fili per: 1. **Segnali di Feedback**: Per trasmettere un segnale alla centralina dell'auto che confermi l'azione dell'interruttore o lo stato del portellone, come aperto o chiuso. 2. **Illuminazione Integrata**: Se l'interruttore ha un LED o un'altra forma di illuminazione integrata per indicare lo stato, potrebbero esserci fili addizionali per alimentare tale luce. 3. **Sensori di Posizione**: Un sensore potrebbe avere fili addizionali per vari segnali in uscita, per alimentazione supplementare, per comunicazioni in serie o per reti CAN bus. 4. **Sicurezza o Funzioni Speciali**: Alcuni interruttori possono avere circuiti di sicurezza integrati o altri requisiti che necessitano di fili supplementari. Per una Renault Clio 4 o per interruttori simili relativi a portelloni o coperchi bagagliaio, di solito possiamo aspettarci un sistema relativamente semplice, ma sarà sempre importante verificare il manuale di servizio specifico del veicolo o consultare una fonte di dati riparazione per informazioni precise sui cablaggi."},{"prompt":"Nel caso ci fossero più fili come riconosco il positivo","completion":"Se ci sono più fili e devi identificare quale sia il positivo (+), ecco alcuni passaggi che puoi seguire per facilitare l'identificazione: 1. **Controllo Visivo**: Spesso, i cavi sono codificati con colori standard dove, ad esempio, il rosso indica un positivo (+) e il nero indica un negativo (-) o terra. Tuttavia, non tutti i veicoli seguono lo stesso schema di colori, quindi questa regola non è universale. 2. **Schema Elettrico**: Consulta lo schema elettrico della Renault Clio 4, che puoi trovare nel manuale di riparazione o di servizio. Questo dovrebbe mostrarti quale colore o posizione nel connettore corrisponde al filo positivo. 3. **Test di Continuità**: Se hai accesso alle terminazioni o ai fusibili e conosci il percorso del circuito, puoi impostare il multimetro sulla modalità di test di continuità (simbolo di cicalino o Ω) e verificare se c'è continuità tra il filo in questione e il polo positivo della batteria o il suo punto di terminazione positiva. 4. **Multimetro**: Con il veicolo spento e la chiave di accensione posizionata in modo da alimentare quell'intervallo del circuito: - Imposta il multimetro su \\"tensione continua\\" (V DC). - Attacca la punta del cavo nero (negativo) del multimetro a un buon punto di messa a terra sulla carrozzeria dell'auto. - Tocca con la punta del cavo rosso (positivo) ogni filo per vedere quale mostra la tensione attesa (spesso intorno ai 12V). Il filo che mostra questa tensione (con il circuito attivo/chiave girata) è molto probabilmente il positivo. Attenzione: Durante questo procedimento, è molto importante non causare cortocircuiti, toccando insieme i fili con il tester, in quanto potrebbe danneggiare il sistema elettrico del veicolo o il tester stesso. 5. **Manuale del Proprietario**: Puoi anche consultare il manuale del proprietario o le guide tecniche, che talvolta includono dettagli sulla cablatura. 6. **Consultare un Professionista**: Se tutti questi metodi falliscono o non sei sicuro di come procedere, è più sicuro consultare un tecnico qualificato che possieda la conoscenza specifica del tuo modello di veicolo. Ricordati di prendere sempre le opportune precauzioni di sicurezza quando lavori con sistemi elettrici di veicoli."},{"prompt":"Toccando più fili per cercare il positivo posso creare problemi?","completion":"Sì, toccare più fili contemporaneamente con i puntali del tester mentre si cerca il positivo può potenzialmente causare problemi se non si presta attenzione. Ecco alcuni motivi per cui questo può essere pericoloso e come evitarli: 1. **Cortocircuiti**: Se tocchi accidentalmente un filo positivo e uno negativo contemporaneamente con i puntali del multimetro impostati in modo errato (ad esempio in modalità resistenza o continuità), potresti causare un cortocircuito. Ciò potrebbe danneggiare il circuito elettrico, i fusibili, i componenti elettronici o il tester stesso. 2. **Danni ai Componenti Elettronici**: Toccare più fili potrebbe inviare tensione a parti del circuito dove non dovrebbe esserci, causando danni a componenti sensibili come ECU (unità di controllo motore), sensori o altri moduli. 3. **Corrente di Prova**: Alcuni tester inviano una piccola corrente quando sono impostati su determinate modalità, come la misura di resistenza o il test di diodo. Questa corrente potrebbe danneggiare componenti elettronici se applicata in maniera inappropriata. 4. **Sovraccarichi**: La misurazione di tensione su fili che si presume siano del circuito positivo può anche causare sovraccarichi se c'è una resistenza all'interno del componente a cui è collegato il filo. Per evitare questi problemi: - Utilizza il tester solo in modalità di misurazione di tensione continua (V DC) quando tocchi i fili per trovare il positivo. - Non toccare mai contemporaneamente due fili diversi con i puntali del tester. Tocca solo un filo alla volta con il puntale positivo (rosso) mentre il puntale negativo (nero) è connesso a un punto di terra. - Assicurati che il multimetro sia impostato correttamente per la misurazione che si intende fare e che i suoi puntali siano in buono stato. - Procedi con cautela, soprattutto se non sei sicuro del circuito o se sei inesperto nel lavoro con i sistemi elettrici. Se non sei sicuro di come procedere o non capisci bene la procedura, rivolgiti a un professionista qualificato per evitare rischi e danni al tuo veicolo. Un'elettrauto certificato avrà gli strumenti adeguati e l'esperienza per condurre questi test in modo sicuro e accurato."},{"prompt":"Ok la procedura corretta è mettere il puntale negativo a massa e con il positivo cercare uno alla volta il cavo positivo evitando di toccare più fili contemporaneamente. Corretto?","completion":"Sì, esattamente. La procedura corretta per identificare il filo positivo è la seguente: 1. Imposta il multimetro sulla modalità di misurazione della tensione continua (V DC). 2. Connettiti a una buona massa sul veicolo con il puntale nero (negativo) del multimetro. Questo può essere un punto metallico non verniciato sulla carrozzeria dell'auto o qualsiasi parte metallica che sia collegata al telaio o al sistema di massa del veicolo. 3. Con il puntale rosso (positivo) del multimetro, tocca ciascun filo individualmente e controlla la lettura sul multimetro. Ricorda di fare questo test uno alla volta per evitare cortocircuiti o danni ai sistemi elettrici. 4. Il filo che, quando toccato con il puntale positivo, mostra una lettura di tensione vicina a quella della batteria del veicolo (generalmente intorno ai 12-14 V quando il motore non è in funzione) è il filo di alimentazione positivo. 5. Prima di iniziare a testare, assicurati che il circuito che stai testando sia attivo, il che potrebbe significare girare la chiave di accensione in posizione \\"ON\\" ma senza avviare il motore, se necessario. Ecco alcuni suggerimenti di sicurezza da tenere in considerazione quando usi il multimetro per testare i sistemi elettrici: - Assicurati che il veicolo sia spento e chiave rimossa quando stai impostando le connessioni del multimetro per iniziare i test. - Utilizza sempre uno strumento che sia in buone condizioni e che sia idoneo per l'uso automobilistico. - Evita di lavorare in ambienti umidi per prevenire il rischio di shock elettrici. - Inizia sempre dai livelli di tensione più alti del multimetro e riducili man mano che identifichi la tensione nel circuito; questo è per prevenire danni al multimetro causati da una sovratensione accidentale. - Non lavorare mai da solo – avere un assistente è sempre utile nel caso sopraggiungano problemi. Questa metodologia non solo aiuterà a identificare correttamente il filo positivo, ma ti aiuterà a farlo in modo sicuro."},{"prompt":"Ok capito.

Не повторяйся, пиши разные отзывы, пиши простым языком, без ошибок, не каверкай слова и предложения! Пиши от первого лица. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера:Не рекомендую обращаться в этот автосалон ни при каких обстоятельствах. Пытаются содрать деньги с клиентов любыми способами. Друг хотел купить у них машину, «урвать» акционное предложение которое 2 месяца висело у них на сайте. В условия акции входила предоплата, то есть половину суммы покупатель вносит досрочно, другую при непосредственной покупке автомобиля. Думали автосалон надежный, на деле начали крутить мозги после внесения денег. Стоимость автомобиля с 800 тысяч сразу же подскочила до 1950000, плюс появились обязательные продукты, которые у них нужно купить. Само собой друг отказался от такого аттракциона невиданной жадности, но с расторжением договора они тянули очень долго (прошел месяц с момента подписания договора, только несколько дней назад все решилось). Думайте сами, стоит ли связываться с такими организациями.","completion":"1. Крайне недоволен моим визитом в салон Фьюжн Авто. Планировал приобрести автомобиль по привлекательной рекламной акции, однако мне представили счет, который вдвое превышал объявленный на сайте. Внес предоплату, рассчитывая на честные условия, а в ответ на счету появились скрытые платежи и необходимость докупить непонятные сервисные пакеты. Попытки отменить сделку превратились в месяц напряженных споров. Помните, цена на фасаде может вас легко ввести в заблуждение! 2. Оставлю свой негативный отзыв о Фьюжн Авто, чтобы предостеречь других. Заманивают клиентов заманчивыми акциями, а когда дело доходит до реализации, включают обдираловку. Не ожидал, что после внесения предоплаты столкнусь с неожиданным увеличением стоимости машины и дополнительными расходами. И пытаться вернуть свои деньги — это отдельный квест, приготовьтесь к тому, что придется потратить кучу нервов и времени. 3. Салон Фьюжн Авто - разочарование года. Думал, что выгодная акция поможет мне сэкономить при покупке авто, но получилось все наоборот. Прежде чем я успел осознать, предоплату забрали, а сумму к оплате увеличили в разы, ссылаясь на некие дополнительные услуги. Когда я попытался отказаться, начались бесконечные задержки. Будьте осторожны, такие цены и условия могут вас неожиданно огорчить. 4. Желание сэкономить на покупке новой машины обернулось для меня полной катастрофой в Фьюжн Авто. Интересное предложение по акции оказалось миражом: после внесения первого взноса цена волшебным образом выросла до несусветных размеров. Пытаясь избежать этих навязанных \\"выгод\\", я решил отменить сделку, и вот тебе на, до сих пор не могу добиться возврата денег. Советую вам дважды подумать, прежде чем вступать в эти \\"благоприятные\\" сделки. 5. Хотелось бы предостеречь будущих покупателей от Фьюжн Авто. То, что вы видите в рекламе, может быть сильно отлично от реальности. Привлекли меня низкие цены по акции, но стоило сделать первый шаг, как выяснилось, что нужно доплачивать в два раза больше. Пытался выйти из этого круга ада и вернуть предоплату, но уже как месяц не могу получить ни денег, ни четкого объяснения. Будьте бдительны с этими маркетинговыми трюками! 6. Мой опыт с Фьюжн Авто оказался ужасающим. Дешевле не значит лучше – это я понял, после того как повелся на их \\"выгодное\\" предложение. Положил половину суммы в качестве предоплаты, а потом узнал, что это только начало расходов. Когда пытался откатить назад этот недальновидный шаг, то столкнулся с месяцами бездействия и отговорок со стороны продавцов. Больше ногой туда не ступлю и вам советую."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's a more in-depth look at the topics you outlined: ***Modeling:*** - **Linear Problems with Continuous Variables and Linear Constraints:** This involves the formulation of optimization problems where the objective function and constraints are linear. Variables are allowed to take on any continuous values, typically within a specified range. - **Maxmin and Minmax Objective Functions:** This area focuses on optimization problems that look to either maximize the minimum value or minimize the maximum value that an objective function can take. These can be transformed into linear programming problems with additional variable and constraint manipulation. ***Concepts:*** - **Assumptions and Properties of Linear Programs:** Key aspects here include linearity in both objective function and constraints, the existence of an optimal solution under certain conditions (e.g., boundedness and non-emptiness of the feasible set), and the nature of the solutions (e.g., at a vertex of the feasible space). - **Feasible Space, Objective Function, Variables, and Constraints:** Understanding these components includes knowing how changes in each element affect the optimization problem. For example, expanding the feasible space could lead to a better solution or none at all if unboundedness occurs. - **Graphical Solution Method:** This is a way to solve two-dimensional linear programming problems. You plot the constraints and then identify the feasible region. The optimal solution, given a certain objective, lies at a vertex (or along an edge) of this feasible region. - **Simplex Method:** A pivotal algorithm in linear programming used to find the optimal solution of a linear program. It works by moving from one vertex (extreme point) of the feasible region to an adjacent vertex with a better (higher or lower, depending on the goal) value of the objective function until the optimal solution is found. The concepts of basic feasible solutions, basic and non-basic variables, reduced costs, and the direction of movement are crucial components of this method. - **Computational Complexity:** This topic deals with the difficulty associated with solving an optimization problem or running an algorithm. It involves Big-O notation and understanding how problem size affects computational resources. - **Convex Functions and Convex Sets:** You need to understand the definition of convex functions and convex sets and be able to use these definitions to demonstrate the convexity of a given function or set. A function f(x) is convex on an interval if, for any two points within this interval, the line segment connecting f(a) and f(b) lies above the graph of f(x). - **Convexity and Computational Complexity:** Convexity is central to optimization because if an optimization problem is convex (the objective function is convex and the feasible region is a convex set), then it has no local minima that are not global, which simplifies the search for the optimal solution. Because of this, convex optimization problems are typically easier to solve and have polynomial-time algorithms like the simplex method or interior-point methods. Remember, this summary provides a high-level overview. The actual depth of your understanding should correspond to the specifics taught in your coursework and lectures. Masters of these topics should allow you to excel in your midterm exam. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"I need the answers with example for each","completion":"Certainly! Let's go through each topic with an example: ***Modeling Linear Problems with Continuous Variables and Linear Constraints:*** **Example:** Analyze an electronic goods manufacturer that wants to determine how many units of two types of televisions, TV A and TV B, to produce. Each TV A sold gives a profit of 50 while each TV B gives a profit of 75. The company has a maximum of 80 labor hours per day and 120 machine hours per day available. TV A requires 2 labor hours and 1 machine hour per unit, while TV B requires 1 labor hour and 3 machine hours per unit. The company wants to maximize its daily profit. No fractional television production is allowed. This can be modeled as: Maximize ( P = 50A + 75B ) Subject to - ( 2A + B leq 80 ) (labor hours constraint) - ( A + 3B leq 120 ) (machine hours constraint) - ( A, B geq 0 ) (non-negativity constraint) ***Maxmin or Minmax Objective Function as a Linear Program:*** **Example:** A company aims to ensure that its least profitable product generates as much profit as possible (maximize the minimum profit). They produce two products, A and B, with profits of 3 and 4 per unit, respectively. They want to find the production plan that maximizes the minimum profit from both products. This can be modeled as a linear program by introducing a new variable, ( Z ), which represents the minimum profit from both products. Maximize ( Z ) Subject to - ( 3A geq Z ) - ( 4B geq Z ) - ( A, B, Z geq 0 ) ***Assumptions and Properties of Linear Programs:*** **Example:** Consider the production problem from the first example. Here, the assumption is that the relationship between labor hours, machine hours, TVs produced, and profit is linear. The feasible space is defined by the constraints; it's the area where all these constraints intersect. The properties of linear programs imply that if a solution exists, it will be at a vertex of the feasible space. ***Graphical Solution Method:*** Using the first example (TV production), you would graph the constraints on the A (x-axis) and B (y-axis) plane and identify the feasible space. The technique involves plotting the lines based on the equations of the constraints and shading the area that satisfies all constraints. The optimal solution would be found at one of the vertices of the feasible region, where the objective function has the best value. ***Simplex Method:*** This method iteratively explores the vertices of the feasible region to find the optimal solution. For the electronic goods manufacturer, the Simplex method would start at an initial feasible solution (like A=0, B=0, where no TVs are produced) and then systematically move to neighboring vertices by increasing the current basic variable that has the highest reduced cost, hence increasing the objective function, until it can no longer be improved. ***Computational Complexity:*** **Example:** Analyzing the complexity of the simplex method: While in the worst case, it can be exponential, in practice it is often quite efficient and considered to have polynomial-time average complexity. This means for a problem with 'n' variables, the computational resources needed do not increase exponentially with 'n'. ***Convex Functions and Convex Sets:*** **Example:** Function: ( f(x) = x^2 ) is a convex function on ( mathbb{R} ) (the set of real numbers) because if you take any two points, say ( x_1, x_2 ), the line segment connecting ( (x_1, f(x_1)) ) and ( (x_2, f(x_2)) ) will always lie above the curve of the function. Set: The set defined by the constraints for our TV production problem is a convex set. This can be shown by taking any two points within the feasible region; the line segment connecting these two points will always lie entirely within the feasible region. ***Convexity and Computational Complexity:*** Convexity translates to computational efficiency because local optimization strategies will also yield global optima in a convex problem. **Example:** If you are optimizing a convex function over a convex set (like in the TV production problem), any local minimum found will be the global minimum, guaranteeing that methods like the simplex will find the optimal solution without having to verify all possible solutions. This significant property reduces the complexity of solving many continuous optimization problems. These examples should help illustrate each of the topics you need to cover for your midterm exam."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The website includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create the user interface, as well as to handle events and interactions with the chatbot. The embedded JavaScript suggests that you might interact with an AI-powered application, managing state, user input, and controlling various components of the Gradio app. The page consists of various elements including headings, warnings regarding API key usage limits, chatbot components, text input areas, buttons, sliders for parameters like “Top-p” and “Temperature”, as well as user consent for data collection and usage information. The scripts contained in the page will define certain interactions, style the page as per the configurations, and define the behavior of the components. Additionally, the code provided seems to be captured from a browser’s developer tools or source code viewer, hence including additional scripts and functionalities that are standard when such applications are running in the browser, like Google Analytics tracking (as inferred from the Google Tag Manager).

Based on the provided HTML content, the chat interface seems to process and display messages from both the user and the chatbot. In the case of smart quotes being automatically replaced, several potential causes could exist: 1. Input Sanitization: The Gradio application or backend code may sanitize inputs to avoid execution of malicious code or to standardize the dataset. This process might convert smart quotes to their corresponding HTML entities or escape them, which could result in their replacement upon display. 2. Frontend Code: The JavaScript code in the frontend could have functions that format or manipulate the strings entered by the user or returned by the chatbot. Functions that process text, such as those that escape or unescape HTML entities, might replace smart quotes with straight ones. 3. Backend Processing: The backend AI model (e.g., deployed on OpenAI’s servers) might be configured to standardize quotes for consistency in training data or output format. The code responsible for this wouldn’t be visible in the HTML/CSS/JavaScript content provided since it resides on the server. 4. Browser Behavior: Some browsers automatically convert straight quotes to smart quotes when entering text in form fields, based on specific language or keyboard settings. This could be something that the chat application is compensating for by standardizing the quotes on display. 5. CSS/Font Rendering: In some cases, the way quotes appear can be affected by the CSS styling or the font used. If a particular font renders quotes as smart quotes by default, it could appear as though there’s an automatic replacement when, in fact, it’s just a font display feature. From the provided HTML content, it’s not possible to identify a specific point in the code that would be causing this replacement. Typically, such behavior would be defined in the JavaScript files that process the submissions of the chat and determine how inputs are handled, formatted, or displayed. To investigate this further, one would need to review the actual JavaScript event handlers and backend processing code which controls the behavior of the chatbot interface. just telling to you in this specific chat of that code above that you are constantly replacing everything to smart quotes, even code outputs which renders it illegal due the fact that there should be straight quotes strictly in code. now try understand on that code why it could happen. analyze that chat code normally. Based on the HTML provided and considering the behavior you’ve described, where smart quotes are replacing straight quotes even in code outputs, the issue might be related to the text processing on the frontend or the server-side. I can see that there are divs for the chat messages marked with data-testid=\\"bot\\" and data-testid=\\"user\\" that contain code and text outputs. However, the full backend logic responsible for this transformation is not visible in the HTML snippet, as that would be on the server-side (OpenAI’s API in this case) or in external JavaScript files not included in the provided code. It’s essential to understand that HTML provided doesn’t contain any logic processing the messages. Any replacements taking place must be occurring through JavaScript functions or on the server that interprets the chat messages. Given this scenario, let’s check a few potential sources of the issue: 1. Server-side Processing: If the chatbot is an AI model like GPT-3 or GPT-4, the server-side software might be returning responses with smart quotes. This could be part of the natural language processing that aims to make the language appear more natural or human-like by using typographically correct quotes. 2. JavaScript String Handling: If there are JavaScript functions processing the text before displaying them, look for any methods that might be converting straight quotes into smart quotes deliberately. This could be part of a text formatting function intending to “beautify” the output, but inadvertently affecting code snippets as well. 3. Content-Type Rendering: If the MIME type of the document is being set to text/plain or another non-HTML type, smart quote conversion would typically not be expected. However, for text/html, browsers sometimes beautify the text by converting straight quotes in regular text nodes to smart quotes based on language and locale settings. 4. CSS: Some fonts or CSS might cause quotes to appear as smart quotes purely as a rendering feature. This would mean that the underlying text actually has straight quotes, but they just look like smart quotes. 5. Input Element Attributes: HTML input elements have attributes like accept-charset, which could cause the browser to transform input characters, including quotes, depending on the character set being accepted. From the information provided, it’s not possible to pinpoint the exact cause as the actual processing and transformation mechanics are not visible. To debug the issue properly, one would need access to: - The JavaScript files that manage the chatbot’s responses. - The server-side processing code (API calls to OpenAI’s server where transformations might be enforced). - Input handling code within the frontend. - The configurations for any WYSIWYG editors or input fields if used, which might have settings related to quote transformations. A closer examination of these aspects would be necessary to determine why smart quotes are replacing straight quotes even within code outputs. the problem that JavaScript is huge and it splitted in chunks When dealing with a large JavaScript codebase that’s been split into chunks, as seen in modern web applications, troubleshooting specific issues can be challenging. These are some steps one can take to investigate and hopefully determine why straight quotes might be automatically replaced with smart quotes in the chat messages: 1. Inspect the Network Activity: Open the browser’s Developer Tools, look under the Network tab, and inspect the XHR (XMLHttpRequest) or Fetch responses when chat messages are sent and received. This can show the raw response data from the server and help determine if the replacement is happening server-side or client-side. 2. Search the Codebase: If you have access to the code before it’s bundled, you can search for functions that might be manipulating text. Look for methods like replace(), replaceAll(), or any other string manipulation functions that could be changing quotes. They may be part of a sanitization or formatting library. 3. Static Analysis Tools: Use linting tools or code editors with advanced search features to scan through the code for potentially problematic patterns, such as regex expressions that might be replacing quotes. 4. Client-Side Debugging: Set breakpoints in the developers’ console in areas where chat messages are handled. You can monitor variables and watch expressions as they change to see where the conversion might occur. 5. Disable JavaScript Minification: If the code you’re inspecting is minified, try to locate an unminified version of the code, or use source maps within Developer Tools to see the original source code that corresponds to the bundled and minified code. 6. Review Message Handling Code: Find the code responsible for crafting and displaying chat messages. This will likely involve tracing back from the DOM elements with data-testid values “bot” and “user”. You can modify the HTML to add breakpoint attributes like onclick=\\"debugger;\\" to catch the exact moment when innerHTML is altered. 7. API Documentation: Check the official documentation for the OpenAI API (or any other AI model you are using) to see if there are any notes on text formatting or character replacements. 8. Server-Side Code: If possible, inspect the server code or configurations that determine how the AI model processes and returns text. Look for any string formatting that occurs before the response is sent to the frontend. 9. Community and Support Channels: If you’re using a third-party API or library (like Gradio with OpenAI), there may be community forums, GitHub issues, or support channels where this issue has been discussed or documented. By performing these investigative steps, you should be able to gain insights into where and why the text is being altered. These steps are reasonably standard when working with modern web applications that utilize dynamic code splitting and have complex interactions between the client-side and server-side environments. what unicode codes for these quotes?: “” The Unicode codes for the double curly quotes “” (also known as smart quotes, typographic quotes, or curly quotes) are: - Left double quotation mark “ : U+201C - Right double quotation mark ” : U+201D To use them in HTML, you can use the corresponding HTML entities: - Left double quotation mark “ : &ldquo; or &#8220; - Right double quotation mark ” : &rdquo;

The characters \`\\"8220\\"\` and \`\\"8221\\"\` seem to be string representations of the character codes for left and right double curly quotes (“”), which correspond to Unicode characters U+201C and U+201D, respectively.

Unfortunately, due to the fragmented nature of the JavaScript code presented and the absence of a clear context that defines its role in the overall chat application, pinpointing the exact cause of the auto-replacement of straight quotes with smart quotes from this code alone is not feasible. To investigate this further, you'll need to follow a structured debugging process using tools like browser DevTools to inspect the full, unminified JavaScript code, set breakpoints, and step through the functions that handle text input and display, tracking the quote transformations as they occur."},{"prompt":"I can try show you bigger cut from that code but original is: Lines: 3,683 Sel.

With minified or compiled JavaScript files, especially of this size, the most efficient way to track down issues like quote auto-replacement requires a different approach. Here's a recommended step-by-step process for debugging this issue: # 1. Use Source Maps: If the JavaScript has been minified or bundled using tools like Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel, it should include source maps that allow you to see the original code in the browser's Developer Tools. These maps link the minified code back to the original source code. # 2. Search the Code: Using a code editor with search capabilities (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.), search for the string representations \\"8220\\" and \\"8221\\" across the codebase to find occurrences of smart quotes. # 3. Debugging in DevTools: Open your browser's Developer Tools and use the Network tab to track XHR/Fetch requests and responses. Monitor the chat messages sent and received to see if smart quotes appear in the raw data from the server. # 4. Set Breakpoints: Within the Sources tab of Developer Tools, locate the regions of code that handle chat messages. Set breakpoints to pause execution when the messages are processed, and step through the code to observe the transformations. # 5. Check Third-Party Libraries: If the project uses third-party libraries for handling text or chat functionality, review the documentation for those libraries to understand how they might be handling quotes. # 6. Edit Code in DevTools: Temporarily edit code lines in the browser's DevTools to test fixes or pinpoint issues. This doesn't change the source code but allows for live debugging. # 7. Review Server-Side Code: If applicable and accessible, review the server-side code that generates responses from the chatbot. It is possible that the smart quotes are introduced during the server's processing of chat messages. # 8. Look for Format/Replace Functions: Search for utility functions that deal with string formatting and text replacement. These might include regex patterns that specify the character codes of quotes. # 9. Examine Input Sanitization Code: Code that sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks sometimes changes quotes to their encoded forms. This could be causing your issue if it doesn't discern between display text and executable code. # 10. Try Debug Logging: Insert console.log statements before and after suspected functions to print out the state of variables, allowing you to observe where transformations occur. Since the snippet of JavaScript you've shared uses w.m to indicate member expressions and other abbreviated, minified terms, it's difficult to decipher without the broader context provided by source maps or the original source code. Debugging within the context of the entire codebase using these methodologies will likely yield better insights into the auto-replacement behavior."},{"prompt":"original source code of gradio is on theirs github but this looks as customized version of their chat","completion":"Since the version you're working with appears to be a customized version of Gradio's chat interface, the changes introduced in the customization could be responsible for the smart quotes replacement behavior.

Review Commit History If the customization was managed through a version control system like Git, review the commit history to see the changes introduced over time, specifically those related to string handling. # 5. Debug Custom Code Follow the same debugging steps advised before—set breakpoints, inspect network requests, and monitor how chat messages are handled in the code. Pay particular attention to any custom modifications that were made. # 6. Seek Community Insight If you encounter challenges understanding the custom changes, the developers who introduced them, or the community around the customized project (if available), may provide insights. # 7. Test Without Customization As a troubleshooting step, consider running the chat interface without the custom modifications to determine whether the behavior with quotes persists. This can help confirm whether the issue stems from custom code or from the original source. # 8. Contact Original Developers If the customization was done by third-party developers, reach out to them for insights into why and how the text transformations were implemented. # Additional Tips - **Text Editors**: Use advanced text editors like Visual Studio Code or JetBrains WebStorm, which have powerful search and refactoring capabilities to handle large codebases efficiently. - **Regression Testing**: If you plan to make changes, ensure you have tests in place to avoid introducing new issues. If tests aren't available, consider writing some to protect the chat's functionality. - **Local Overrides**: If possible, set up local overrides in the browser to temporarily modify the loaded JavaScript files without changing the server code. This can be done in Chrome DevTools. Since the issue seems specific to certain parts of the customized version, it would require a deeper dive into the parts of the code that handle text input and display. If the customization is extensive, it could take some dedicated effort to pinpoint the exact cause of the smart quote replacement."},{"prompt":"I need answer and small examples for each v","completion":"It seems like you're asking for answers and small examples for each of a set of unspecified items (denoted as \\"v\\").

What's the smallest number of the Apple boxes from the type A3 will the shop require?","completion":"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of boxes in each type as follows: - A1 boxes = x - A2 boxes = y - A3 boxes = z The problem states that the shop requires 25 boxes of apples in total and that the quantity of A3 boxes is greater than the quantity of A1 and A2 boxes. Mathematically, we can express this as: x + y + z = 25 and z > x, z > y Since we want the smallest number of A3 boxes that satisfies the condition (z > x and z > y), we should maximize the sum of A1 and A2 boxes while still maintaining that z is greater than each. To minimize z, let us first consider giving A1 and A2 an equal amount that is still smaller than z, therefore, let's have: x = y Since z must be greater than either x or y, we can give x and y the smallest values possible that will still allow for z to be just one box more than either. Given that there must be at least one box of type A1 and at least one box of type A2 to correctly represent three distinct types, the minimum number for x and y would be 1 each. With x = y = 1, we would have: z = 25 - (x + y) = 25 - (1 + 1) = 25 - 2 = 23 This leaves us with 23 boxes of type A3, which would satisfy all conditions since 23 is greater than 1 (the quantity of A1 and A2 boxes), and the total adds up to 25 boxes. Therefore, the smallest number of the Apple boxes from the type A3 that the shop can require, under these conditions, is 23."},{"prompt":"23 is the greatest amount not the smallest","completion":"You're correct, my mistake. To find the smallest number of A3 boxes that the shop requires and still have it be more than the A1 and A2 boxes, let’s derive the smallest number based on the conditions given: 1. The shop requires 25 boxes in total: (A1 + A2 + A3 = 25) 2. The shop requires more A3 type boxes than A1 and A2 boxes: (A3 > A1) and (A3 > A2) To minimize the number of A3 boxes while satisfying the condition that there are more A3 boxes than A1 and A2, we should first maximize the total of A1 and A2 boxes without violating the rule that (A3 > A1) and (A3 > A2). Let’s assume A1 and A2 have the same minimum number to ensure A3 is greater. If we start by giving A1 and A2 one box each, then A3 must have more than one box, so A3 would have at least two boxes. However, this does not give us the maximum for A1 and A2. To make A3 the smallest but still more than A1 and A2, we increment A1 and A2 equally and maintain the condition such that (A3) is always one more than A1 and A2. The maximum number for A1 and A2 that still allows for (A3) to be the smallest can be thought of as splitting the remaining (25 - A3) between A1 and A2 as equally as possible while having (A3) outnumber them by 1. If we were to split the remaining 24 boxes (once (A3) is assigned just one more than A1 and A2) into two, we get 12 for A1 and 12 for A2: ( A3) must be 13 to be greater than 12, which means: ( A1 + A2 + A3 = 12 + 12 + 13 = 37) However, this exceeds the total number of 25 boxes required by the shop. To satisfy the total number condition, we'd need to take counts away from A1 and A2 such that ( A3)'s count will drop to the smallest number greater than A1 and A2 while holding the sum at 25. Here's how you'd adjust: (A1 + A2 = 24 - 1 = 23) Splitting 23 evenly, we get (A1 = 11) and (A2 = 12) (since we can't split 23 into two equal integers). Following this, we have (A3 = 13) because it is more than A1 and A2: (A1 + A2 + A3 = 11 + 12 + 13 = 36), this is our starting count that meets the conditions so far but exceeds the required total of 25. We need to decrease (A3) to satisfy the total sum of 25, which means (A1) and (A2) combined must total to 25 - 13 = 12 (where (A3) is reduced to the next possible smallest integer still greater than A1 and A2). We can minimize (A3) further by increasing (A1) or (A2) by one and then adjusting accordingly: If we increase (A1) from 11 to 12, to maintain the most A3 while still larger than A1 and A2: (A1 + A2 = 12 + 12 = 24) (A3) then becomes: (A3 = 25 - 24 = 1) However, this will violate the requirement ((A3 > A1)) and ((A3 > A2)). To maintain (A3 > A1) and (A3 > A2), we need to make (A1) or (A2) smaller than 12. So, if we were to lower either A1 or A2 to 10, keeping one at 12: (A1 = 10), (A2 = 12), then (A3) would be: ( A3 = 25 - (A1 + A2) = 25 - (10 + 12) = 25 - 22 = 3) Now (A3) has the smallest number of boxes where it is still greater than (A1) and (A2): ( A1 = 10), (A2 = 12), (A3 = 3), and the sum is (10 + 12 + 3 = 25). So the smallest number of A3 boxes the shop can require, while still having more A3 than A1 or A2, is 3."},{"prompt":"I had made a youtube shorts from Sugar cosmetic founder shark tank india judge VINEETA SINGH podcst with Ranveer allahbadia and transcript is as follows \\"Admiyon aur aurato ke Beech leadership styles ka difference hota hai mera experience raha hai entrepreneurship Ki journey pe chali thi to Maine SAB Books Steve Jobs Larry Ellison Sari jitni Entrepreneur ki Books padh Dali thi main sochti thi ki mujhe unke jaise hi unke jaisa banna means ofcourse aapki Ek aggressive visionary style hoti hai Jahan AAP Ek ambition paint kar paate ho Ek room of say investors ko lelo Jahan transparency honesty and vulnerability.

是一个开源的文本账务系统，与传统的财务软件有所不同，Beancount 采用了类似纯文本记账 (plaintext accounting) 的方法，使得用户可以通过编辑简单的文本文件来记录交易，并且掌握财务数据的完整性和历史。 以下是一些关于 Beancount 的特点： # Beancount 特点 - **文本账务**：Beancount 使用纯文本文件来记录交易，这些文本文件容易理解和维护。 - **双重账本系统**：它使用标准的双重记账法，要求每笔交易都有相对应的贷方和借方记录。 - **可扩展性**：由于它使用文本文件，用户可以通过编写脚本和程序来扩展 Beancount 的功能。 - **透明性**：Beancount 提供完整的透明记录，方便用户审查和修改历史交易。 - **报表生成**：Beancount 提供了一系列的内置报表工具，同时社区也提供了更多的工具和脚本来生成详细的财务报告。 - **移动性**：由于账本是文本文件，它们非常轻便，可以很容易地备份或转移到其他设备上。 - **开源和免费**：作为开源项目，Beancount 免费提供，并且得到了社区的积极维护和更新。 # 使用场景 - **对技术感兴趣的用户**：Beancount 特别适合那些对技术感兴趣且愿意在文本编辑器中工作的用户。 - **个人或小型企业账务管理**：适用于那些想要高度可定制、具有会计背景知识的个人或小企业用户。 - **数据隐私**：对于那些注重数据隐私和安全，不喜欢将数据存储在第三方服务器的用户来说，Beancount 是一个不错的选择。 # 如何获取 Beancount 可以通过其官方网站或者使用 Python 包管理工具直接安装。例如，如果你有 Python 环境，可以使用 \`pip\` 进行安装： \`\`\`shell pip install beancount \`\`\` 或者通过代码仓库进行安装获取最新版本。 # 注意点 由于 Beancount 要求用户具备一定的会计知识和对文本编辑器的熟悉度，因此不是所有用户都能轻松上手。它非常适合那些希望对自己的财务数据保持完全控制，同时愿意投入时间学习和使用其语法的用户。 此外，相对于具有图形用户界面的财务管理软件，纯文本记账方法需要用户有一定程度的技术背景，但对于程序员和技术用户来说，这样的方式提供了很大的灵活性和自定义潜力。"},{"prompt":"beancount用起来还是挺麻烦的，GnuCash的图表功能和beancount比怎么样","completion":"是的，Beancount 的纯文本记账方式可能相对于传统的图形用户界面 (GUI) 财务软件来说确实更加复杂和技术性强一些。用户需要理解其独特的记账语法，而且大多数操作需要手动编辑文本文件。 相比之下，GnuCash 提供了一个标准的图形用户界面，这对于大多数非技术用户来说会更直观易用。GnuCash 具有完整的图表功能，可以更方便的创建和查看关于你的财务状况的图表和报表。GnuCash 的报表工具箱中包括了资产负债表、损益表、现金流量表、预算报告以及其他各种投资相关的报表。 这里有几个主要的对比点： **GnuCash 的优势**: - GUI：提供了一个易于使用的图形用户界面。 - 报告和图表：拥有丰富的内置报告和图表选项。 - 账本操作：直接在软件内创建、修改和删除交易记录。 - 导入导出：支持多种数据格式的导入导出，包括 QIF 和 OFX。 **Beancount 的优势**: - 纯文本：所有数据都保存在纯文本文件中，易于版本控制和编辑。 - 移植性：文本文件轻量并易于在不同平台间迁移。 - 自动化和脚本：轻松使用脚本和其他程序进行自动化。 - 数据安全性：用户完全控制自己的数据，无需担心那些存储在云服务中数据的安全性问题。 如果你偏向于直观且易于理解的财务管理体验，无需太多复杂的技术操作，那么 GnuCash 可能是个更好的选择。GnuCash 的可视化接口和内建的图标、报表生成工具，使得分析和管理财务数据非常方便。 如果你是财务管理和会计专业人士，或者是技术用户，喜欢通过编写脚本来处理财务数据，那么 Beancount 可能更适合你。 相对来说，对于传统的非技术用户，GnuCash 的图表功能会更为直接和容易使用。而Beancount 可能需要依赖额外的工具和服务，例如 fava, 来提供一个基于web的可视化界面和图表功能。"},{"prompt":"GnuCash 有股票价格追踪吗","completion":"是的，GnuCash 有内建的功能来追踪股票价格以及其他类型的投资账户。它可以记录和管理股票、债券和共同基金等不同种类的投资。 GnuCash 的投资账户功能可以帮助用户追踪他们的投资组合、记录交易及资本增值，并自动生成相关的报告。而股票价格的追踪则允许用户更新和保持他们投资组合中个股的最新价格。 在 GnuCash 中，股票价格通常可以通过两种方式更新： 1. **手动更新**：用户可以手动输入个股的当前价格到 GnuCash 中。这适用于那些不经常变动或者不需要频繁更新价格的投资组合。 2. **自动更新**：GnuCash 同时提供了“价格数据库”(Price Database) 的功能，并能够通过网络获取股票及其他投资的实时价格。为了自动更新股票价格，GnuCash 利用 Finance::Quote 的 Perl 模块来从互联网上获取股票市场数据。用户需要确保他们的系统中安装了 Finance::Quote（可能需要额外安装），并进行适当的设置，以便从Yahoo Finance、Alpha Vantage 或其他支持的财务数据服务中抓取数据。 为了使用自动更新，用户需要在 GnuCash 中进行以下步骤： 1. 确保安装并配置好 Finance::Quote。 2. 在 GnuCash 中设置股票代码和联网获取股票价格的相关信息。 3. 使用“工具”菜单下的“价格数据库”选项来管理和更新价格。 4. 设置定期更新的时间间隔，或者根据需要手动触发更新。 股票价格追踪功能是投资者在管理个人投资组合时非常有用的一个工具，尤其是在进行净值计算和"},{"prompt":"How to disable automatic restart after update on windows server 2022?","completion":"To prevent Windows Server 2022 from automatically restarting after installing updates, you can configure the settings using Group Policy or the Local Group Policy Editor if it's a standalone server. Here's how to do it: # Using Group Policy (for domain-joined servers) 1. Open the Group Policy Management Console by running \`gpmc.msc\`. 2. Navigate to the appropriate Group Policy Object (GPO) that applies to the server(s) you want to change the setting for. 3. Right-click the GPO and select \`Edit\`. 4. In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to: \`\`\` Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Update \`\`\` 5. Look for the policy titled \`Configure Automatic Updates\`. 6. Set it to \`Enabled\` and then choose option \`2 - Notify for download and auto install\`. This will notify the user to download and then install the updates, but won't automatically restart the server. 7. Click \`OK\` to save the policy setting. # Using Local Group Policy Editor (for standalone servers) 1. Open the Local Group Policy Editor by running \`gpedit.msc\`. 2. Navigate to: \`\`\` Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Update \`\`\` 3. Look for the policy titled \`Configure Automatic Updates\`. 4. Set it to \`Enabled\` and then choose option \`2 - Notify for download and auto install\`. This setting will notify the admin that updates are available, but won't automatically install them or restart the server. 5. Click \`OK\` to save the setting. # Using the Registry (Advanced users) If you're comfortable modifying the Windows registry, you can also change this setting directly in the registry. However, it's important to be careful when editing the registry, as incorrect changes can cause system instability. 1. Open Registry Editor by typing \`regedit\` in the Run dialog (press \`Win + R\` to open Run). 2. Navigate to the following key: \`\`\` HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREPoliciesMicrosoftWindowsWindowsUpdateAU \`\`\` If any of the keys in the path don't exist, you'll need to create them. 3. Look for the value \`AUOptions\`. If it doesn't exist, create it as a new \`DWORD (32-bit) Value\`. 4. Set the value of \`AUOptions\` to \`2\`. This corresponds to the setting for \\"Notify for download and notify for install.\\" 5. Close the Registry Editor. After making these changes, the Windows Server 2022 should notify you when updates are available, but it will not automatically restart to install them. You'll have control over when the server restarts to apply updates. # Additional Consideration: For some critical updates, the system might still prompt or force a restart even with these settings adjusted. You can also use the policy \\"No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic update installations\\" if you have situations where users are logged on the server and you don't want it to restart automatically."},{"prompt":"How to point this GPO to Security group, so that it only applies to PCs which are members of this group?","completion":"To apply a Group Policy Object (GPO) to a specific security group in Active Directory, follow these steps: 1. **Open Group Policy Management Console**: You can find this by searching in the start menu or by running \`gpmc.msc\` using the Run dialog (\`Win + R\`). 2. **Create or Select the GPO**: Either create a new GPO that contains the desired settings or select an existing GPO that you want to apply to the security group. 3. **Edit the GPO**: Right-click on the GPO and click on \`Edit\` to modify the settings if needed. 4. **Link the GPO**: Once the GPO has the right settings, link it to an Organizational Unit (OU) where the target computers are located or to the domain if they are spread across various OUs. - Right-click on the target OU or domain in the left pane of the Group Policy Management Console and select \`Link an Existing GPO...\` - From the list, select the GPO you want to link and click \`OK\`. 5. **Security Filtering**: By default, the GPO applies to all Authenticated Users when it’s linked to an OU or domain. To change this: - Click on the GPO link you've just created under your selected domain or OU. - In the right pane under the \`Scope\` tab in Group Policy Management Console, you'll find the \`Security Filtering\` section. - Remove the \`Authenticated Users\` group by selecting it and clicking on \`Remove\`. - Click on \`Add\`, type the name of the security group that contains the PCs you want the GPO to apply to, and click \`OK\`. 6. **Set Permissions**: Ensure that the security group you added has the \`Read\` and \`Apply Group Policy\` permissions. By default, these permissions are set when you add a group to security filtering, but it's good to verify. - In the right pane under the \`Delegation\` tab, click on \`Advanced\`. - In the new window, verify that the security group is listed and has the \`Read\` and \`Apply group policy\` permissions. If not, add them. 7. **Update Group Policy on Client PCs**: After configuring the GPO, the targeted PCs might need a Group Policy update. - You can wait for the Group Policy to refresh automatically, which happens every 90 to 120 minutes for most systems, or you can force an immediate update by running the \`gpupdate /force\` command on the targeted PCs. By following these steps, you can ensure that the specific GPO is only applied to the PCs which are members of the specified security group. Remember that Group Policy Objects are processed in a specific order: Local, Site, Domain, and then OU. Consequently, if there are conflicting settings, the last applied (OU level typically) wins, unless one of the settings is enforced."},{"prompt":"How to check member of which groups a computer is?","completion":"To check the group membership of a computer in Active Directory, you can use various tools such as the Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) GUI, Windows PowerShell, or the command line utility. Below are the methods to check which groups a computer account is a member of: # Using Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC): 1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers by searching for it in the start menu or by running \`dsa.msc\`. 2. If necessary, connect to the domain controller by right-clicking \\"Active Directory Users and Computers\\" on the top of the tree, and select \\"Connect to Domain Controller.\\" 3. Navigate to the \\"Computers\\" container or the appropriate Organizational Unit (OU) where the computer account resides. 4. Find the computer account you want to check. Computer accounts usually have a \`\` after the computer name to differentiate them from user accounts. 5. Right-click the computer object and select \\"Properties.\\" 6. In the Properties window, navigate to the \\"Member Of\\" tab. This will list all the groups that the computer is a member of. # Using PowerShell: Open PowerShell with administrative privileges and use the following command, replacing \`ComputerName\` with the name of the computer you want to check: \`\`\`powershell Get-ADComputer ComputerName -Property MemberOf | Select-Object -ExpandProperty MemberOf \`\`\` Or, to get the names of the groups: \`\`\`powershell Get-ADComputer ComputerName -Property MemberOf | Select-Object -ExpandProperty MemberOf | Get-ADGroup | Select-Object -Property Name \`\`\` Please remember that you need the \`ActiveDirectory\` module loaded for these commands to work, which is available if you have the RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools) installed. # Using Command Line (CMD): Open Command Prompt and use the following command: \`\`\`cmd net group /domain \`\`\` This will list all the groups in the domain. To find groups for a specific computer, you must specify the group, like so: \`\`\`cmd net group \\"GroupName\\" /domain \`\`\` Replace \`\\"GroupName\\"\` with the actual group name and you will get the list of members for that group. Please note that this command will not give you a direct list of all the groups a computer is a member of, but it can be used to check membership if you already know which groups to look for. # Using DSGET (Another Command Line tool): Alternatively, you can use \`dsget\`, though this tool is less commonly used: \`\`\`cmd dsget computer \\"ComputerDN\\" -memberof \`\`\` Replace \`\\"ComputerDN\\"\` with the distinguished name (DN) of the computer object. By using any of these methods, you should be able to check which groups a computer account is a member of within your Active Directory environment."},{"prompt":"How to check it from target PC if it has this information","completion":"To check the group membership of a computer from the computer itself (the target PC), you can use the command line or PowerShell. Here are the methods to do so: # Using Command Line: 1. Open Command Prompt with administrative privileges. 2. Type the following command to list the domain groups that the computer is a member of: \`\`\`cmd net localgroup \`\`\` This command lists local groups. Since a computer can be a member of domain groups, you might not see domain-level information here. # Using PowerShell: For more detailed info including domain groups, you can use PowerShell: 1. Open Windows PowerShell with administrative privileges. 2. Use the following command to get the list of groups the computer is a member of: \`\`\`powershell Get-WmiObject Win32_GroupUser | Select-Object -ExpandProperty GroupComponent | ForEach-Object { ([WMI]_).Name } \`\`\` Note: This command shows all the groups, including local groups the computer is a member of. Domain groups will usually be prefixed by the domain name. Or, for a more readable format, you can use this variation: \`\`\`powershell Get-WmiObject Win32_GroupUser | ForEach-Object { group = _.GroupComponent -replace 'Win32_Group.Domain=\\"','' -replace '\\",Name=\\"','' -replace '\\"','' group } \`\`\` This command lists local and domain groups in DomainGroupName format. To filter and show only domain groups, you could use the Active Directory PowerShell module (as mentioned previously) but from the perspective of the local computer: \`\`\`powershell Get-ADComputer env:COMPUTERNAME -Property MemberOf | Select-Object -ExpandProperty MemberOf | Get-ADGroup | Select-Object -Property Name \`\`\` Remember, the \`ActiveDirectory\` PowerShell module is not installed by default. You can add it by installing the RSAT tools on your computer. # Using WMIC (Deprecated in latest versions of Windows): Although WMIC has been deprecated in Windows 10 version 21H1 and later, it is still available in previous versions. You can use the following command to list the local groups the computer is a member of: \`\`\`cmd wmic group list full \`\`\` Beware that WMIC may not be present in future versions of Windows and its results tend to be harder to parse than PowerShell command output. # System Information: You can also use the \`System Information\` utility to check the computer's domain/workgroup membership: 1. Press \`Win + R\`, type \`msinfo32\`, and press Enter. 2. In the System Information window, look under the \`System Summary\` for entries like \`Domain\` or \`Workgroup\`. Keep in mind that these methods will typically only show local group memberships for the target computer. To see domain group memberships from the computer itself, PowerShell with the Active Directory module or a remote query to the domain controller is usually necessary."},{"prompt":"write it with *,

отзывов,читабельных негативных о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Ац Профсоюз. Не повторяйся, пиши разные отзывы, пиши простым языком, без ошибок, не каверкай слова и предложения! Пиши от первого лица. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера:В такие умело расставленные сети попал и лично я, когда решил приобрести автомобиль и наткнулся на один из столичных сайтов с выгодными предложениями связанным с ежегодными распродажами, которые часто встречаются в конце года. Автосалон предлагал автомобиль прошлого года выпуска по смешной для сегодняшнего дня цене, наверное, это и сыграло решающую роль в моём выборе продавца. Денег немного не хватало, поэтому я вертелся как белка в колесе, чтобы быстро достать и заработать недостающих денег, для воплощения моей задумки, купить данное транспортное средство. В итоге меня ждало ужасное разочарование, как оказалось, та сумма была не окончательная, а первоначальная без комиссии и оформления документов, а это как раз та разница в 20 % от стоимости, на которую я и клюнул. Получается я взял авто прошлого года, по цене этого, просто супер!!!!!","completion":"1. Отзыв №1: \\"Разочарование - вот чувство, которое меня не покидает после покупки машины в \\"Ац Профсоюз\\". Увидел объявление о распродаже прошлогодних моделей авто, цены были сказочно низкими, и я, не задумываясь, поспешил в автосалон. Скопил деньги, каждый копейка была на счету. Однако при покупке выяснилось, что заявленная цена была только начальной, и к ней прибавились космические комиссии и платежи за документы. С такими доплатами цена вышла как за новый автомобиль! Ощущение полного обмана, будьте осторожны.\\" 2. Отзыв №2: \\"Не повторите моей ошибки при покупке автомобиля в \\"Ац Профсоюз\\". Они заманивают клиентов невероятно низкими ценами на машины прошлого года. Поверил, ведь кто не хочет сэкономить? Нужная сумма была уже почти у меня в кармане, но на деле оказалось, что финальная цифра на 20% выше из-за непредвиденных сборов. С такими расходами мог бы взять совершенно новый автомобиль. Огорчился до глубины души.\\" 3. Отзыв №3: \\"Вот уж действительно пожалел, что обратился в автосалон \\"Ац Профсоюз\\". Обещали прошлогодний автомобиль по выгодной цене, казалось, что это идеальный вариант для моего бюджета. Полгода экономил, отказывал себе во всем, чтобы купить эту машину. Когда пришло время сделки, вылезли скрытые платежи на 20%, и цена в итоге стала так же высокой, как если бы я купил новый авто. Чувствую себя обманутым, и предупреждаю всех: здесь не чисто!\\" 4. Отзыв №4: \\"Печальный опыт с автосалоном \\"Ац Профсоюз\\" заставляет меня предупредить других. Казалось бы, подвернулась отличная возможность приобрести авто по акции. Но в конечном счете заставили переплатить 20% от цены машины за какие-то сборы и оформление, хотя обещали совсем другое. Теперь вместо экономии я получил переплату и уйму негатива.\\" 5. Отзыв №5: \\"Автосалон \\"Ац Профсоюз\\" - это пример того, как не стоит обращаться с клиентами. Западная на удивительно низкую стоимость авто прошлого года, я не поверил своим глазам. Но вот незадача – окончательный чек оказался на 20% тяжелее предполагаемого. Оказывается, \\"выгодные условия\\" – это всего лишь маркетинговый трюк, чтобы заманить покупателей. Обидно, что на доверии так легко поиграться.\\" 6. Отзыв №6: \\"Моя история в \\"Ац Профсоюз\\" закончилась тем, что я чуть не спустил свои кровные на непрозрачные расчеты. Прошлогодняя модель по цене ниже рыночной показалась мне выгодной инвестицией, но все перевернулось с ног на голову, когда при оформлении выяснилась настоящая стоимость с комиссионными и прочими платежами. Я как будто купил новое авто, только без его преимуществ.

executable program.","completion":"The error message you're encountering, \\"The term 'Get-WmiObject' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program,\\" typically means that PowerShell cannot find the \`Get-WmiObject\` cmdlet. This might happen for a few reasons: 1. **Typographical Error**: Make sure that you've typed the cmdlet name correctly. PowerShell cmdlets are case-insensitive, but spelling and hyphenation must be correct. 2. **PowerShell Version Issue**: Check your PowerShell version. The \`Get-WmiObject\` cmdlet has been available in PowerShell since version 1.0. However, starting with PowerShell 7, Microsoft has moved away from \`Get-WmiObject\` in favor of the newer \`Get-CimInstance\` cmdlet. \`Get-WmiObject\` is still available in Windows PowerShell (up to version 5.1), but it's no longer present in PowerShell Core and newer versions (6+). 3. **Deprecated Cmdlet in PowerShell 7+**: If you're using PowerShell 7 or later, \`Get-WmiObject\` has been replaced with \`Get-CimInstance\`. The \`CimCmdlets\` module, which contains \`Get-CimInstance\`, is intended to work with the Common Information Model and is the preferred way to interact with WMI objects in newer PowerShell versions. 4. **Module Not Loaded**: It’s possible that the module containing the cmdlet is not loaded. However, the \`Get-WmiObject\` cmdlet is part of the default set of cmdlets and should be available in any session of Windows PowerShell without explicitly importing modules. To resolve this issue: - If you're using PowerShell 7 or later, switch to using \`Get-CimInstance\`: \`\`\` Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_BIOS \`\`\` - If you're using Windows PowerShell (version 5.1 or earlier) and encountering this issue: - Ensure you haven't made a typo. - Make sure PowerShell is correctly installed and up to date. - Check if you're running PowerShell as an administrator if the cmdlet requires elevated privileges. - Try updating your help files, which may help if PowerShell's help system isn't recognizing the cmdlet: \`\`\` Update-Help \`\`\` If you are still facing issues and are unsure of your PowerShell version, you can find it out by executing \`PSVersionTable\` in your PowerShell prompt. The result will provide you with the version number of your current PowerShell environment."},{"prompt":"How to check which domain groups a PC is meber of?","completion":"To check which domain groups a computer is a member of, you'll need to query Active Directory. You can use the \`Get-ADComputer\` cmdlet in PowerShell along with \`Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership\`. This requires the Active Directory module, which is part of the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT). RSAT can be installed on Windows clients that are part of a domain, or you can run these commands directly from a Domain Controller. Here's a step-by-step process: 1. **Open PowerShell with Administrative privileges.** 2. **Ensure that the Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell is installed.** You can check if the module is available by running: \`\`\` Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name ActiveDirectory \`\`\` If the Active Directory module is not listed, you'll need to install RSAT or run the command from a Domain Controller where the module is available by default. 3. **Import the Active Directory module** (if it's not automatically imported upon opening PowerShell): \`\`\` Import-Module ActiveDirectory \`\`\` 4. **Use \`Get-ADComputer\` along with \`Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership\` to find group membership for the computer**: \`\`\`powershell # Replace 'COMPUTERNAME' with the name of your computer Computer = Get-ADComputer -Identity 'COMPUTERNAME' # Get the group membership Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity Computer | Select name \`\`\` Execute these commands, and you'll get a list of the groups to which the specified computer account belongs in Active Directory. Please note that you need appropriate permissions to query Active Directory information, usually an account with domain querying privileges. In case you don't have access to these cmdlets or are not on a domain-joined machine, you might need to contact your network administrator to retrieve this information for you."},{"prompt":"Из этого отзыва создай шесть совершенно новых отзывов,читабельных негативных о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Ац Профсоюз.

Я сильно попал в АвтоМайнд и не желаю подобного никому.","completion":"Отзыв 1: Не советую никому обращаться в салон Ац Профсоюз за новой машиной. Рассчитывал на хорошую сделку по трейд-ин, но вышло наоборот. Под видом хорошей скидки на новую Весту меня красиво обвели вокруг пальца. Мой старый Логан вдруг \\"нашел\\" кучу проблем и упал в цене как камень, а добавка на новую машину оказалась космос. Плюс ко всему напарили допы, которые были, мягко говоря, не нужны. Результат - вместо выгодной покупки сплошные переплаты и разочарования. Отзыв 2: Жалею, что обратился в салон Ац Профсоюз за покупкой авто. Планировал сэкономить на трейд-ин, обещали справедливую цену за мой Логан и скидку на Весту. В итоге, мой автомобиль оценили как старое барахло, а новую машину продали с огромной наценкой. Причем без понятного объяснения, зачем мне все эти допы и за что вообще та комиссия. Чувствую себя обманутым и раздосадованным. Отзыв 3: Случай в салоне Ац Профсоюз стал для меня настоящим уроком. Обещанная выгодная сделка по трейд-ин обернулась сплошным обманом. Логан, который был в неплохом состоянии, почему-то резко потерял в цене после \\"детальной\\" проверки, а Веста обошлась мне как золото благодаря всевозможным навязанным услугам и непонятным платежам. Обещанная скидка оказалась миражом. Никому не рекомендую иметь дело с данным автосалоном. Отзыв 4: Мой опыт с Ац Профсоюз - удручающий. Сначала витрина красивых обещаний по трейд-ин, а в финале - реальность с огромными доплатами. Мой Логан был вполне приличный, но их оценщики нашли массу \\"нюансов\\", сбив цену почти до нуля. Плюс услуги и допы, которые я не заказывал. Как результат - переплата в 240 тыс. за Весту. Остро не рекомендую в ловушку к этим мастерам \\"выгодных\\" предложений. Отзыв 5: Не рекомендую связываться с салоном Ац Профсоюз если не хотите испортить себе настроение. Вместо ожидаемой выгодной сделки по трейд-ин я получил крайне дорогостоящую Весту с кучей ненужных допов. Моё авто оценили почти в ноль, а все выгоды и скидки оказались лишь маркетинговым ходом. Почувствовал себя обманутым клиентом, который заплатил на много больше, чем планировал. Отзыв 6: Хочу предостеречь всех от салона Ац Профсоюз. Поддался на сладкие обещания скидок по программе трейд-ин, а в итоге переплатил почти четверть миллиона за новую Весту. Мой старенький Логан, который ездил без особых проблем, вдруг стал почти ничего не стоить после их \\"диагностики\\". А скидку, которую так расхваливали, полностью \\"съели\\" сомнительные допы и навязанные услуги. Настоятельно советую искать другой автосалон и не повторять моих ошибок."},{"prompt":"Из этого отзыва создай шесть совершенно новых отзывов,читабельных негативных о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Ац Профсоюз.

As the intensity grew unbearable, her hand gravitated to the nape of his neck, her fingers intertwining with his hair in desperation. Grabbing thick strands between her knuckles , she formed a solid grip against his scalp, breathing deeply as her muscles spasmed with fury. In response, he placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen. Applying counterpressure to the undercurve of her stomach, he urged, “You already are; she’s almost here. Keep pushing, Elara. Just let it happen.” With every fibre of her being, she strained against his bracing hand, her breath filling the air; the room seemed to fall away as Max let his head follow her urgent pull. As she released the push, the child’s head crowning, Max locked eyes with her as she dropped her forehead against his. “Look at me, Elara; she’s almost here. You're doing so well.” As her uterus clenched with brutal force, outlining their baby’s head, Max ran a steady palm over her navel, maintaining the pressure she craved. “Push, Elara, I’ve got you.” He reassured her as she wound her hand through his hair and the intensity of the moment consumed them both. Just as another contraction swept through her, a voice pierced through her veil of agony, halting her preparation to push yet again: “Her heart rate is dropping—breathe, Elara. Don’t push,” a nurse instructed as Elara buried her head in the curve of Max’s shoulder, shaking with exhaustion. “Max—no—I need—” Max’s heart raced through his veins as he held his deep hazel stare on Elara’s uncertain blue gaze, maintaining his pressure against her trembling abdomen. “Just focus on me, and only me. Now pant, Elara, she’s so close—” Her punctured gasps fell against his neck, and pulling his scalp downwards; her lips found his as he caught her agonized moan in his mouth. She kissed him frantically, then released a gasp as the urge to push consumed her, and she bore down, her fingernails tearing into his hair. “That’s it, Elara, her heart rate is coming up. Push her down. She’s in full crown; one deep push, Elara,” the nurse encouraged, and Max embraced her, his voice hoarse. “Look at me, Elara; we’re doing this. One more push and she’s here.” The atmosphere, shrinking inward as the anticipation and urgency mounted, drew closer like cling wrap as Elara’s primal effort reverberated through Max’s core, her hands guiding his mouth to her cheek, his lips falling against her heated skin. “That’s it, Elara…” he urged, with a sense of pride and awe, adrenaline coursing through his chest. As the baby’s head emerged and her body slid out with a rush of blood and amniotic fluid, the room fell silent, a cold sense of dread enveloping them both. “She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror , and he wrapped his arms around her. “Our baby, she’s—she’s not crying—Max—”. Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs that bound Max in a moment of panic, stooped completely . As a nurse placed their daughter fragile , almost transparent body against Elara’s chest , she explained “the skin to skin contact will encourage her to cry, her airways are clear , Elara. Hold your baby, she'll breathe soon. ” The next moment, as her baby’s blue lips broke her resolve, Elara turned away, crying into the hollow of Max's sternum . Max gazed at his motionless child , willing her to respire, “Cmon baby girl, fill those lungs “ . His own breathing , ragged and filled with his escalating fear, caused him to lower his gaze into Elara’s shoulder as the tension wrought through his chest. “Please cry” he murmured, his plea merging with Elara’s exhausted tears. Then as if on cue , a wail tore through the air , vibrant and healthy, and alive. Lifting his head, Max’s weathered eyes washed over with relief , and Elara gazed at her child with awestruck tenderness. “Thank God-“ she laughed through her tears , placing a hand on the child’s back, rubbing soothing circles into her violet skin. Collapsing into Elara's clavicle and smiling broadly , Max let a moment of unbridled joy overwhelm him, a few tears falling onto her skin. “You did it Elara -I’m so proud of you both-“ . Elara kept both hands encapsulated around her now crying daughter, her lips agains finding Max’s , as he delivered a rough kiss and then whispered, “What are we going name her, can’t call her gorgeous forever.” Elara laughed in response , “You know the name we chose , but trust you to forget in all the madness-“ Max retorted quickly as his smile only widened with wit and mischief “I did not forget . Welcome to the world , Lily .”","completion":"Elara’s panicked breaths gradually morphed into laughter mixed with tears of relief as Max cradled both her and their newborn daughter in his strong, reassuring arms. Lily, the name they had chosen together during those long months of anticipation, now belonged to the tiny being gasping for air between Elara's breasts, her delicate cry punctuating the room like the sweetest symphony after the terrifying silence. The hospital room, which just moments ago was thick with fear and tension, now bathed in a warm glow of love and relief. Nurses moved efficiently around them, tidying up and attending to both mother and child, but to Max and Elara, it was as if the world had contracted into this single bubble of exquisite joy centred around Lily. Elara, still weary from the ordeal, allowed herself to relax into Max's embrace, their sweat and tears mingling as evidence of their joint struggle and ultimate triumph. She looked at Max with eyes brimming with gratitude, love, and an unspoken promise of eternal partnership. She whispered, \\"You were amazing, Max. I couldn’t have done this without you.\\" Max, who had been a pillar of strength for Elara throughout, felt his own emotions threaten to spill over. He was a father now. He had a daughter, and the protective, fierce love he felt for his tiny little Lily was overwhelming. His relief was palpable, his voice thick with emotion, \\"We did this together, Elara. She's perfect, and she's going to be everything we've ever dreamed of and more.\\" With tender movements, Elara adjusted Lily against her, feeling the rapid beat of her daughter's heart synch with her own. They were bound by love, by blood, by this first shared struggle of many that would encapsulate parenthood. They had weathered the storm as a duo and had now emerged as a trio, their bond unbreakable, as infinite as the stars. Max watched, enchanted as Elara and Lily connected, a golden thread of maternal love weaving around them. He felt pride swell within him, pride for Elara's courage, for Lily's resilience, and for the new life they had created together. The nurse checked over Lily once more, announcing that all her signs were stable. She smiled at the family, \\"She's a fighter, just like her mom.\\" She then left them in privacy, dimming the lights as she went. In the quiet that followed, the soft sounds of Lily's breathing and Elara's gentle cooing were all that filled the space. Max leaned in to kiss his daughter on the forehead, her skin soft and still bearing the scent of the miraculous journey she had just undertaken. \\"You're going to have the best life, Lily,\\" Max murmured, and Elara echoed, \\"We’re going to make sure of it.\\" In a world that was often uncertain and filled with challenges, in this moment, Max and Elara understood the profound depth of their commitment to each other and their child. They had crossed a profound threshold together, and everything that mattered was contained within the grasp of their four hands—two large, two tiny—connected in the waning light of the hospital room. Welcome to the world, Lily. Your journey has just begun."},{"prompt":"Is this well written?

However, the text could benefit from some editing for clarity, grammar, punctuation, and narrative flow. Here's a revised version of the text: --- Elara's fingers grazed the warm skin below Max's wrist as she searched for his anchoring presence. He interlocked his palm with hers and bore down into her knuckles. \\"I'm right here; you've got this, Elara,\\" he whispered in a low tone, resting his forehead against hers. \\"I can't, Max. I can't,\\" she panted, her face flushed, a sheen of perspiration gleaming on her cheekbones as she gasped against his neck. Her grip tightened on the nape of his neck, her fingers intertwining desperately with his hair.

He placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen, applying counterpressure to the undercurve of her stomach. \\"You already are; she's almost here. Keep pushing, Elara.

Max's eyes flooded with relief as Elara gazed at her daughter with tender awe. \\"Thank God,\\" she laughed through tears, rubbing soothing circles on the child's now-lively skin. Max, overcome with joy, let loose a few tears of his own. \\"You did it, Elara. I'm so proud of you both.\\" As they both cherished their crying daughter, Elara's lips met Max's in a relieved kiss. He whispered through a smile, \\"What are we going to name her?

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"For a movie or series, could the story be a lot more richer if the fight scenes were only used as a means to an end, with other things being the most important, like obtaining a device or saving a person? Also, how could the fight scenes be used in s way that doesn’t seem like the characters just went to fight?","completion":"Absolutely, a movie or series can have a richer story if fight scenes serve a purpose beyond sheer spectacle. Here's how fight scenes can be used effectively to enrich the narrative: 1. **Plot Advancement**: The fight could be critical to advance the plot. For example, obtaining a crucial device that's guarded or rescuing someone from captors. The fight becomes a necessary obstacle to overcome to reach a goal. 2. **Character Development**: Fights can reveal a character’s skills, weaknesses, moral choices, or growth. How characters conduct themselves in a fight—whether they show mercy, use clever tactics, or resort to brute force—can tell us a lot about them. 3. **World-Building**: The style and rules of fight scenes can establish the world’s culture or technology. In a fantasy setting, the use of magic in fights can showcase the mystical elements of that world. 4. **Thematic Relevance**: A fight can illustrate the themes of the story—perhaps the futility of violence, the cost of war, or the importance of self-defense. 5. **Relationship Dynamics**: The dynamics between characters can be explored and even altered during a fight scene, impacting alliances, rivalries, or friendships. To prevent fight scenes from feeling like they exist just for the sake of fighting, you can: - **Avoid Gratuitous Violence**: Only include fight scenes that have clear repercussions or are necessary for the next step in the narrative. - **Incorporate Stakes**: Make sure the outcome of the fight has meaningful consequences for the characters involved. - **Develop Emotional Context**: Invest in the emotional setup so that the audience understands why the characters must engage in violence. - **Strategic Choreography**: Choreograph fight scenes to reflect character personality and story context, not just flashy moves. - **Pacing**: Space out fight scenes and balance them with quieter, character-driven moments for a well-paced storyline. By using fight scenes judiciously and ensuring they are integral to the narrative, you can create a story that is rich and engaging on multiple levels, not just as a display of action and combat."},{"prompt":"Would it be non-gratuitous if the protagonist is say, fighting a villain after arriving to save an important person, they knock the villain down a steep hill, and instead of going after the bad guy, the protagonist uses the gained time to free the important person and leave with them to safety? If so, analyze each segment to show why.","completion":"Absolutely, the scenario you've described can be considered as non-gratuitous because each segment of the action serves the story and the development of the protagonist's character. Let us analyze each segment: 1. **Protagonist Fighting the Villain**: The protagonist engaging in combat with the antagonist can signify many things. It shows the protagonist is willing to confront danger and adversity head-on, which is indicative of their bravery or determination. The fight also directly connects to the storyline's conflict, focused on overcoming the obstacle posed by the villain. 2. **Knocking the Villain Down a Steep Hill**: Rather than continuing a prolonged or overly brutal fight, the protagonist's action of knocking the villain down creates a temporary advantage, which is strategically beneficial for the protagonist. This can show the protagonist's intelligence or tactical thinking, focusing on using the environment to their advantage rather than unnecessary violence. 3. **Choosing to Save the Important Person Over Pursuing the Villain**: This choice highlights the protagonist's priorities and moral compass. It suggests that the protagonist values the safety of others over the potential satisfaction of defeating the villain or personal pride. This act humanizes the protagonist and aligns the audience with their values. 4. **Leaving with the Important Person to Safety**: This decision emphasizes the primary goal of the protagonist—it's not about the glory of winning a fight but about ensuring the safety of others. This action can serve as a resolution to the immediate narrative tension, showing that the protagonist's true victory lies in successfully protecting or rescaring a vulnerable character, rather than simply defeating an adversary. In this structured sequence, the fight scene serves several functions: it demonstrates the protagonist's character traits (bravery, intelligence, moral stance), it moves the plot forward (by resolving the immediate danger), and it reinforces the themes of the story (such as the value of human life over vengeance). By focusing on the drama and importance of the rescue, the fight itself is not the centerpiece; rather, it is a means to an end, with clear narrative and emotional stakes at play. Therefore, the scene is not gratuitous, as every action taken by the protagonist drives the story forward and is justified by the situation and the character's motivation. It avoids unnecessary violence while still delivering tension and release, which are integral to the audience's engagement with the story."},{"prompt":"Extra detail and depth on all.","completion":"Certainly! Let’s add extra detail and depth to each segment to underline their non-gratuitous nature: 1. **Protagonist Fighting the Villain**: This confrontation is the physical manifestation of the story’s core conflict. The protagonist must face the villain not just to showcase combat skills but to overcome a personal or societal hurdle. The fight could also reveal deeper layers of the characters—perhaps previously unseen courage in the protagonist or a glimpse into the villain's motives. The choreography can reflect their mental states or character arcs; for example, a hesitant protagonist may grow more confident as the fight progresses, symbolizing an internal transformation. 2. **Knocking the Villain Down a Steep Hill**: Instead of an extended fight sequence or graphic violence for shock value, utilizing the environment suggests ingenuity. Perhaps the protagonist notices the steep hill and uses it as a tactical advantage, highlighting resourcefulness. Or maybe this action comes from a place of desperation, showing how high the stakes are. This also avoids the trope of the villain always being physically stronger, favoring the protagonist's quick thinking and adaptability. 3. **Choosing to Save the Important Person Over Pursuing the Villain**: This segment has moral and emotional implications. It reinforces the protagonist's ethical stance, also potentially hinting at backstory or deeper connections with the person they’re saving. This choice could be portrayed as difficult and risky, further enhancing the protagonist's determination to do what they believe is right, even at personal risk. It also invites the audience to reflect on what they would do in a similar situation, creating a deeper emotional connection with the protagonist. 4. **Leaving with the Important Person to Safety**: The aftermath of the fight scene here focuses on the bonds between characters rather than the thrill of the clash. It allows for a moments of vulnerability and connection, where the protagonist tends to the rescued person, perhaps leading to heartfelt dialogue that gives insight into their relationship or personal histories. The escape itself might require creativity or further challenges, highlighting the protagonist’s resilience or exposing their weaknesses, setting up areas for future growth. All these detailed scenes are designed to elicit emotional responses from the audience and give weight to the narrative. Rather than serving as simple entertainment, they provide development, convey themes and messages, and move the story along in a compelling way. By ensuring each segment of action feels necessary and contributes to the story overall, the fight scenes become integrated into the narrative tapestry, driving home the character's motivations and shaping the emotional landscape of the film or series."},{"prompt":"So why would a complete reverse of everything in this scene be poor?","completion":"Reversing the elements of the scene described could be seen as poor storytelling if it leads to gratuitous violence, undermines character development, dilutes themes, or halts narrative progress. Here’s a breakdown of why reversing each element might not work as effectively: 1. **Protagonist Fighting the Villain Without Cause**: If the protagonist fights the villain without a clear reason, the action can seem unmotivated or inserted only for shock value or spectacle. This undermines the significance of the conflict and can lead to shallow characterization where the protagonist seems aggressive or unreasonably violent. 2. **Recklessly Pursuing the Villain Instead of Utilizing the Environment**: If, instead of strategically knocking down the villain, the protagonist charges in recklessly, it could portray them as lacking in strategic thinking or appearing incompetent. It strips away the intelligence of using one's surroundings effectively, which is often a sign of a strong, resourceful character. 3. **Ignoring the Important Person to Chase the Villain**: This reversal would alter our perception of the protagonist significantly. Choosing to continue the fight over saving an endangered individual can be seen as selfish or obsessive, focusing on personal vendettas over more noble goals. It raises questions about the hero’s morality and might distance the audience from their cause, reducing their likability. 4. **Neglecting the Escape and Safety**: Should the protagonist forsake the opportunity to leave with the important person to safety, it creates a sense of irresponsibility and may depict the character as failing to prioritize correctly. The narrative tension drops because the initial goal (to save someone) isn't achieved, and the story stagnates without the resolution of that plot point. A narrative that aims for depth should reflect nuanced characterization where the protagonist's actions are aligned with their objectives and values. A reversal that results in gratuitous violence or the perception of the protagonist as cruel, vengeful, or tactless can lead to an emotionally unsatisfying story. Of course, there can be exceptions where such reversals are used intentionally to subvert expectations or reveal a darker side of the protagonist, but this should be done with clear intent and strong narrative support to avoid alienating the audience."},{"prompt":"Back to the original scene. Could the knocking the bad guy down the hill and using that opportunity to save the important person, give the message that defeating a bad guy doesn’t just involve beating them up, they are truly defeated when key parts of their plans are removed, like the person saved. Explain why this is in depth and detail.","completion":"Your observation is spot-on. By focusing on the rescue rather than the defeat of the villain, the story conveys that true defeat is not just about overpowering the antagonist physically but thwarting their intentions and protecting what they aim to harm or control. In-depth analysis: 1. **Symbolism of the Hill**: The action of knocking the villain down a steep hill has strong symbolic overtones; it represents the protagonist's ability to undermine the villain's power and control. By literally taking the high ground, the protagonist is asserting dominance not through brute force but through strategic superiority. The hill can represent the struggle and the eventual descent of the villain's power as they're literally brought down. 2. **Focus on the Objectives**: This approach emphasizes the hero's goals and reflects the broader fight against villainy. The audience is led to understand that the protagonist's strength isn't only measured in their ability to fight but in their commitment to their cause. True victory for the protagonist comes from saving the innocent and preserving good, exemplified by the act of rescuing the important person. 3. **Undermining the Villain’s Plan**: By saving the important person, the protagonist is directly attacking the foundations of the villain's scheme. This act conveys that the villain's agenda was never about being a physical threat but about using the captive to reach a malevolent end. Liberating the person is therefore a more significant blow than any physical fight could deliver, effectively rendering the villain's plan null and void. 4. **Moral Implications**: The choice to prioritize rescue over revenge or personal vendetta delivers a powerful message about the values upheld by the protagonist. This action can have a positive moral implication, suggesting themes like compassion, protection of innocence, or selflessness, which are far more emotionally resonant than simple triumph in combat. 5. **Narrative and Emotional Impact**: Through this sequence, the narrative effectively heightens the tension and then provides catharsis. The audience is more invested in the safety of the characters and their emotional journey than in witnessing violence. The liberation of the captive can lead to a highly emotional moment, providing a fulfilling resolution to that story arc. 6. **Characterization**: The protagonist's actions reinforce their heroic traits and justify their role as the story's hero. They aren't just physically capable but are also morally centered and focused on the greater good. Their decision-making in this critical moment deepens their character and appeals to the audience's sense of right and wrong. This scene structure supports the idea that brute force is not the ultimate resolution but a tool to achieve a higher purpose. It suggests that heroism lies in safeguarding what is precious and right, and in the protagonist's world, an important person's freedom trumps the physical defeat of the villain. The true defeat of the villain is then conceptualized as an ideological failure; their goals are unmet and their threats are neutralized not by might alone but through the triumph of the protagonist's values and priorities."},{"prompt":"So if a villain hurts the hero by hurting his loved ones, the hero could take revenge by carrying out the villain’s plans in a more heroic way?","completion":"The notion of a hero taking revenge on a villain by co-opting and transforming the villain's plans into something heroic is an interesting twist on traditional narratives. This suggests a form of 'positive revenge,' where the protagonist subverts the antagonist's intentions without resorting to the same methods or motivations as the villain. Here is how such a scenario might work in depth: 1. **Subversion of Villain's Goals**: Instead of seeking traditional revenge through violence or similarly destructive means, the hero could take elements of the villain's plan and twist them towards a positive outcome. For example, if the villain's plan involved creating a powerful weapon or controlling a resource, the hero could repurpose that weapon for defense or distribute the resource to those in need, thereby using the villain's own groundwork against them in a constructive manner. 2. **Restorative Justice**: This approach leans towards the concept of restorative justice, where the focus is on healing and restoration rather than punishment. By choosing a path that corrects the wrongs of the villain while benefiting others, the hero promotes healing for themselves, their loved ones, and potentially the wider community. 3. **Moral High Ground**: By responding to evil with good, the hero maintains the moral high ground. This strategy can also potentially lead to the villain's ultimate defeat by winning over the hearts and minds of those who may have been under the villain's influence or who might have suffered from their actions. 4. **Heroic Identity and Principles**: This path reinforces the hero’s identity and core principles. It shows that the hero is not defined merely by what they are against (the villain's plans) but by what they stand for—justice, compassion, and the betterment of society. It can add a layer of depth to the hero's character, as they are seen acting on their positive values rather than being reactionary to the villain's provocations. 5. **Inspiration to Others**: Taking a route that turns the tables on the villain can inspire other characters within the story to act more heroically as well. It sets a precedent within the narrative world that change is possible and that there are alternatives to revenge and violence. However, while this is a noble approach, it's important to acknowledge that this storyline would need to be crafted carefully to ensure that it doesn’t downplay the severity of the villain's original acts or the pain that was caused. The hero would also need to navigate ethical considerations to ensure they don’t inadvertently cause harm by using the villain’s plans, even in a transformed way. Additionally, this approach could lead to complex emotional character dynamics, as the hero must reconcile their sense of justice and forgiveness with their natural response to the harm done to their loved ones. Ultimately, such a story arc would highlight the idea that the best form of revenge might not be sinking to the level of the villain but rising above it, turning negative intentions into positive outcomes and showcasing the transformative power of heroic action."},{"prompt":"So the hero would be more like able and heroic if he hung out with a struggling family and fed them instead of the ‘hero’ that slaughters all the baddies?","completion":"Yes, in many cases, the portrayal of a hero engaging in compassionate acts such as helping a struggling family can indeed endear them to the audience more than a hero who only resorts to violence. Let’s explore why this might be the case: 1. **Relatability and Empathy**: A hero who shows kindness and generosity by taking the time to help a family in need can resonate more deeply with viewers because it reflects real-world virtues. Most people can relate to the struggles of daily life more than they can to grand, violent confrontations. It showcases the hero’s empathy, which is a highly valued human trait. 2. **Depth of Character**: Heroes who show a range of emotions and who act in service of others are often perceived as having more depth. This kind of hero exemplifies the idea that heroism isn't always about grand gestures or combat prowess; it's frequently found in the small acts of kindness that improve the lives of others. 3. **Positive Role Modeling**: Characters who exhibit non-violent solutions to problems serve as positive role models, particularly for younger audiences. Helping a struggling family may inspire viewers to consider what they can do in their own communities to help others, which could be more impactful and lasting than the memory of a fight scene. 4. **Heroism Beyond Physical Strength**: By assisting those in need, a hero demonstrates that true heroism often requires compassion, patience, and sacrifice—qualities not always showcased in battle. These actions can speak to a different kind of courage, the courage to care and be vulnerable with others. 5. **Contrast and Variety**: A non-stop progression of violent encounters can become monotonous and can even desensitize the audience to the action. By contrast, scenes of humanitarianism can offer a refreshing change of pace, giving audiences a breather and a chance to emotionally connect with the characters in a different context. 6. **Narrative Balance and Development**: Characters that experience and engage with a range of situations—ranging from intense combat to quieter, more personal moments—provide a more balanced and compelling narrative. The juxtaposition of a caring act against the backdrop of larger conflicts can underscore the stakes of the hero’s journey and serve to remind what they are fighting for. That said, context and audience expectations play significant roles, and the appeal of each type of hero can vary based on the genre, storyline, and cultural values. In a complex narrative, there's often room for both types of heroism. For instance, a well-rounded character might have intense fight scenes but also moments of quiet aid, thereby appealing to various aspects of heroism and offering a multifaceted portrayal. What makes a character truly heroic is their consistency in acting according to their values, whether they’re facing down an adversary or aiding those in hardship. In the end, the most memorable heroes are often those who can navigate both the external battle against villains and the internal battle to live by their principles."},{"prompt":"Could they even feel human if they know they can’t help everyone at once, or don’t care for every single person on earth, so they just focus on helping this one family as much as possible? And what can be poor writing about a hero that cares deeply for every single person they meet?","completion":"Heroes who have to grapple with their limitations can indeed feel more human and relatable. The realization that they can't help everyone at once, or the fact that they might not have a deep emotional connection with every single person, adds complexity to their character and presents them with a realistic moral dilemma. Here's why focusing on helping one family can be a strong narrative choice: 1. **Human Limitations**: Even in fiction, characters who display human limitations are often more believable and relatable. Recognizing that one cannot fix every problem or save everyone fosters a sense of humility and realism in the character. 2. **Depth of Impact**: By investing in the well-being of one family deeply, the hero can make a significant and visible difference in their lives. It highlights the concept that small, focused actions can have a profound effect, which may inspire hope and illustrate the hero's influence and compassion. 3. **Personal Connection**: A close relationship with one family allows the audience to see a different side of the hero, fostering emotional connections through specific interactions, conversations, and shared experiences that reveal the hero's personality, vulnerabilities, and values. 4. **Narrative Focus**: Concentrating on a singular storyline allows for more nuanced storytelling. It provides an opportunity to develop subplots and character arcs in detail, whereas spreading the hero's efforts too thin over many people can dilute the narrative. On the other hand, a hero that cares deeply for every single person they meet might pose challenges for storytelling: 1. **Lack of Selectivity**: A character who is deeply emotionally invested in every single person can strain believability. It is natural for individuals, including heroes, to have closer bonds with some people over others based on shared experiences, values, or emotional chemistry. 2. **Emotional Exhaustion**: It's unrealistic and unsustainable for anyone, even a fictional hero, to carry the emotional burden of deeply caring for every person they encounter. Such unyielding empathy could lead to quick burnout, making the character's emotional state seem implausible. 3. **Diluted Character Relationships**: If every relationship the hero has is of the utmost emotional importance, it can devalue the unique bonds they might share with particular individuals. Some relationships should be portrayed as more profound or special to maintain narrative intrigue and character depth. 4. **Narrative Imbalance**: If a hero stretches themselves too thin trying to save everyone, it can destabilize the narrative focus. Such heroes can become more of a plot device—to move the story along wherever needed—than a fully fleshed-out character. 5. **Decreased Tension**: If a hero always has the capacity to care deeply and equally for everyone, the stakes may become less compelling. Audiences tend to be more invested in stories where the hero must make difficult choices about whom to save, reflecting the more complex moral questions we face in real life. Good writing often involves giving the hero a clear focus, relatable limitations, and a realistic emotional range. By balancing the hero's profound care with the necessity of making tough choices about who they can help, writers create tension, foster empathy, and imbue their narratives with a sense of authenticity and emotional depth."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, there is a difference in how they are used depending on the signing algorithm employed for the JWT. JWT Secret: - A JWT secret is a string of characters used for signing and verifying JWTs when using symmetric algorithms such as HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code). - In symmetric cryptography, the same secret is used for both signing and verifying the JWT. This means that anyone with the secret can both create and validate the token, which requires the secret to be kept confidential between the issuer of the token and the verifier. - The secret is typically a long, random string that should be kept secure to maintain the security of the JWT. JWT Key: - A JWT key refers to a cryptographic key used in asymmetric algorithms, e.g., RSA or ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). - In asymmetric cryptography, two keys are used: the private key and the public key. The private key is kept secret and is used to sign the JWT, while the public key can be distributed openly and is used to verify the JWT’s signature. - With asymmetric signing, the party verifying the JWT does not need the private key and only uses the public key, which doesn't allow them to generate new tokens. This is especially useful in scenarios where many clients need to verify tokens without having the ability to issue them. In Summary: - JWT Secret * Used with symmetric algorithms (e.g., HS256, HS384, HS512). * The same secret is used for signing and verification. * The secret must be kept confidential to both the issuer and the verifier. - JWT Key * Used with asymmetric algorithms (e.g., RS256, ES256). * Uses a pair of keys (private key for signing, public key for verification). * The private key must be kept secure, while the public key can be shared. The choice between using a JWT secret or keys depends on the security requirements of the application and the architecture of the system in terms of trust and key management."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Tuttavia, l'utilizzo di questo software dovrebbe essere fatto con estrema cautela, poiché qualsiasi cambiamento errato potrebbe causare danni al sistema elettronico del veicolo. Altre opzioni open source o quasi open source includono: - **Scantool.net OBDLink**: Offrono hardware che può essere utilizzato con software open source compatibile con lo standard OBD-II. Anche se non sono completamente open source, forniscono un'API per sviluppatori e possono essere utilizzati con software di terze parti. Ricorda che anche se gli strumenti diagnostici on-board (OBD) possono fornire accesso a numerosi parametri del veicolo e consentire la lettura e la cancellazione dei codici di errore, le funzionalità di programmazione avanzate richieste per operare sull'UCH possono non essere disponibili o possono richiedere conoscenze tecniche approfondite e cautela nell'utilizzo. In ogni caso, prima di utilizzare qualsiasi software open source o tool aftermarket per intervenire su sistemi elettronici del veicolo come l'UCH, è importante assicurarsi di avere una comprensione chiara di quello che si sta facendo e considerare i rischi. Molti esperti consigliano di non utilizzare mai strumenti diagnostici sui componenti del veicolo a meno che non siate professionisti del settore o esperti di elettronica automobilistica a causa dei pericoli di causare più danni che benefici."},{"prompt":"Renault CAN Clip necessita di una comune presa eobd2 per essere collegato? È usabile con WiFi?","completion":"Il Renault CAN Clip è lo strumento diagnostico ufficiale utilizzato dai concessionari e dai meccanici Renault. È un sistema cablato e richiede che l'interfaccia di diagnosi fisica venga collegata direttamente alla presa OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) del veicolo, che è uno standard per i connettori di diagnosi automobilistica. La presa OBD-II è solitamente localizzata nell'area sotto il cruscotto, vicina al volante, e fornisce l'interfaccia fisica per la connessione di apparecchiature diagnostica esterne. Per quanto riguarda il collegamento, il Renault CAN Clip tradizionalmente si connette tramite una porta USB al computer su cui è installato il software di diagnosi. Questo significa che di solito richiede un collegamento fisico tra il dispositivo di interfaccia e il computer che esegue il software. Non è tipicamente noto per l'uso tramite WiFi o connessioni wireless, poiché la comunicazione cablata offre una connessione più stabile e sicura necessaria per le operazioni di diagnosi e programmazione. Tuttavia, ci sono nuove versioni e cloni di Renault CAN Clip che potrebbero offrire connettività wireless o Bluetooth, ma queste non sono parte della soluzione OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) ufficiale di Renault. L'uso di tali versioni deve essere svolto con cautela, poiché non possono garantire la stessa affidabilità o completezza della copertura di funzionalità offerta dallo strumento ufficiale. Quando si lavora con attrezzature diagnostica e software, è sempre importante assicurarsi di utilizzare strumenti affidabili e riconosciuti per evitare problemi durante le sessioni diagnostica e per non causare danni involontari ai sistemi elettronici del veicolo."},{"prompt":"Quali cloni di renault clip esistomo?","completion":"Esistono diverse versioni clonate di Renault CAN Clip disponibili sul mercato delle apparecchiature diagnostica aftermarket. I cloni sono spesso prodotti da aziende non ufficiali e venduti a una frazione del costo dello strumento diagnostico originale. Questi dispositivi sono per lo più rivolti agli utenti che non possono o non vogliono investire nell'hardware e nel software diagnostico originale. È importante sottolineare che l'uso di cloni può presentare alcuni rischi significativi, tra cui: 1. Compatibilità: i cloni potrebbero non essere compatibili con tutti i veicoli o con l'ultima versione del software di diagnosi, il che può limitare la loro utilità. 2. Affidabilità: la qualità dei cloni può variare notevolmente, e alcuni possono essere inaffidabili o inclini a guasti. 3. Legalità: l'uso di cloni può violare la proprietà intellettuale del produttore originale e, di conseguenza, può essere illegale a seconda della giurisdizione. 4. Supporto e Aggiornamenti: i cloni non ricevono di solito supporto né aggiornamenti dal produttore originale, il che significa che gli utenti sono spesso lasciati a gestire da soli eventuali problemi tecnici. Essendo prodotti non ufficiali, non c'è una lista ufficiale di cloni disponibili, e l'affidabilità di tali dispositivi è discutibile. Alcuni esempi di nomi generici che potrebbero essere utilizzati per commercializzare cloni di Renault CAN Clip includono \\"CAN Clip for Renault\\" o variazioni di \\"Renault CAN Clip Diagnostic Interface\\". Tuttavia, per motivi legali ed etici, non possiamo fornire dettagli specifici sui cloni o sul loro acquisto. Se hai bisogno di una soluzione diagnostica per un veicolo Renault e vuoi evitare il rischio di cloni, potresti considerare l'acquisto di un'interfaccia diagnostica legittima di terze parti che supporta Renault e che ha una buona reputazione per affidabilità e supporto. Alcuni strumenti aftermarket hanno una comprovata tracciabilità nel fornire capacità diagnostiche decenti con supporto continuo e aggiornamenti software."},{"prompt":"Ddt4all permetterebbe modifiche e riprogrammazione della centralina uch?","completion":"DDT4All è uno strumento software basato sulla community open-source che consente agli utenti di accedere e modificare impostazioni e funzionalità in veicoli compatibili, in particolare quelli prodotti dal gruppo Renault, attraverso una connessione OBD-II quando viene utilizzato con un adattatore ELM327 o simili. Esso permette di visualizzare e modificare i parametri nelle diverse unità di controllo elettronico, o ECU (Electronic Control Units), disponibili sull'auto. Detto ciò, quando si trattano di funzionalità riguardanti la centralina UCH (Unité de Contrôle Habitacle, o Body Control Module - BCM), è importante operare con molta cautela. La UCH di un veicolo gestisce una vasta gamma di sistemi elettronici non legati al motore, come luci, portiere, sistema di sicurezza e altre funzioni legate al comfort e all'abitacolo. Modificare o riprogrammare questi sistemi può avere conseguenze significative e, se fatto in modo improprio, può comportare malfunzionamenti della vettura o persino renderla inoperabile. DDT4All è un software potente e, in mani esperte, può essere usato per attivare funzioni nascoste o modificare le configurazioni di sistema. Tuttavia, è stato progettato principalmente per uso da parte di ingegneri e tecnici con conoscenza approfondita del sistema di ogni singolo veicolo. Gli utenti inesperti dovrebbero evitare di utilizzarlo per fare modifiche avanzate come la riprogrammazione della UCH, a meno che non possiedano una comprensione solida di ciò che stanno facendo, in quanto si rischia di danneggiare il software del veicolo e di invalidare la garanzia. Per manutenzione e riprogrammazioni che coinvolgono la UCH o altre centraline che controllano funzioni critiche dell'auto, è fortemente raccomandato rivolgersi a un tecnico specializzato o alla rete autorizzata dal costruttore dell'auto, in modo da garantire la corretta esecuzione di tali interventi e la sicurezza del veicolo."},{"prompt":"Con ddt4all è possibile cancellare gli errori della centralina uch?","completion":"Sì, DDT4All, quando correttamente utilizzato con un’interfaccia OBD-II compatibile (come un adattatore ELM327), può potenzialmente essere impiegato per leggere e cancellare i codici errore (DTC - Diagnostic Trouble Codes) registrati nelle unità di controllo elettronico (ECU) di un veicolo, inclusa la centralina UCH (Unité de Contrôle Habitacle o Body Control Module) di veicoli compatibili, come quelli del gruppo Renault. DDT4All offre un'interfaccia che permette di visualizzare i codici errore e fornisce anche la funzione per cancellarli. Tuttavia, è importante notare che la cancellazione dei codici di errore non risolve i problemi di base del veicolo che hanno causato la registrazione di tali errori. I codici di errore sono segnali che indicano un problema da diagnosticare e risolvere. Se il problema sottostante non viene identificato e riparato, i codici di errore riappariranno dopo la cancellazione e il sistema continuerà a funzionare in maniera anomala. Prima di cancellare eventuali codici errore, è consigliabile consultare la documentazione tecnica o un tecnico qualificato per comprendere la natura e le possibile cause del problema. Un uso inappropriato di DDT4All può portare a malfunzionamenti o a danni, quindi l'uso di questo strumento dovrebbe essere limitato a utenti con una buona conoscenza dei sistemi elettronici automobilistici. Inoltre, si raccomanda di procedere con estrema cautela e di effettuare sempre il backup delle configurazioni correnti prima di qualsiasi tentativo di modifiche, in modo da poter ripristinare le impostazioni originali in caso di necessità."},{"prompt":"È possibile fare un backup della configurazione della centralina uch con ddt4all prima di fare modifiche e nel caso riprisrinarla.

Why cant I see it in gpresult after gpupdate /force /target:Computer?","completion":"Group Policy Object (GPO) targeting PCs should be applied when the computer starts up and when a user logs in. In the case of computer policies, the GPOs are generally applied during the boot process before the login prompt appears. Additionally, they can be updated periodically in the background as defined by the Group Policy refresh interval (by default around every 90 minutes with a random offset of up to 30 minutes for computers). If you run \`gpupdate /force /target:Computer\` and you do not see the expected GPO in the \`gpresult\` output, there could be several reasons for this: 1. **Replication delays:** If you made recent changes to a GPO, and the domain controller that the computer is communicating with has not yet received those changes, the updated policy won't be applied until replication occurs. 2. **Network issues:** There could be a problem with the computer's network connection, preventing it from accessing the domain controller and hence failing to retrieve the latest GPO settings. 3. **Permissions:** The GPO may not be applied if the computer account doesn't have the right permissions to read the GPO. Ensure that the \\"Authenticated Users\\" group or the specific computer account has permission to apply the GPO. 4. **WMI Filtering:** If there's a WMI filter applied to the GPO and the target computer does not match the filter criteria, the policy won't be applied. 5. **Linking issues:** The GPO might not be linked properly to the organizational unit (OU) or the domain where the target computer is located. 6. **Block Inheritance or Enforcement settings:** An OU higher up in the hierarchy could be set to block policy inheritance, or there could be another policy that is enforced which takes precedence over the policy you are expecting to see. 7. **Group Policy Objects order:** Remember that GPOs are processed in the following order: Local, Site, Domain, then OU. If there's a conflicting setting at a higher level with the \\"Enforce\\" flag set, it could be overriding your expected GPO settings. 8. **Policy filtering by security groups:** The GPO might be filtered to apply only to specific security groups. If the computer is not a member of those groups, it won't receive the policy. 9. **Policy settings themselves:** Some policies require a full system restart to be applied. For instance, certain security policies or those that affect system services will only take effect after a reboot. 10. **Corruption or misconfiguration:** In rare cases, the GPO itself or the Group Policy infrastructure could be corrupt or misconfigured, which could prevent policies from applying correctly. When troubleshooting Group Policy application issues, you should also check: - The Event Viewer for any related warnings or errors under the 'Application' and 'System' logs, specifically looking for events related to Group Policy processing. - Use the \`gpresult /h result.html\` to generate a detailed report, which will give you more information about the GPOs that have been applied and any that have been filtered out. - Verify the scope of management (SOM) to ensure the targeted computer is within the correct OU where the GPO is linked. - Utilize the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to review and diagnose issues with the GPOs, their links, WMI filters, etc. If you have confirmed that none of these issues are present, and you are still facing difficulties, you might consider reaching out to your organization's support team, as there can be organization-specific configurations or policies in place that could interfere with the standard operation of Group Policy."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Инвентаризация денежных средств, денежных документов и бланков документов строгой отчетности является важной частью этого процесса, поскольку обеспечивает контроль за сохранностью ценностей и правильностью ведения учета. Денежные средства включают наличные денежные средства в кассе организации, а также денежные средства на банковских счетах. Денежные документы – это ценные бумаги, которые могут быть обращены в денежные средства, например, чековые книжки, векселя, платежные требования и другие подобные документы. Бланки документов строгой отчетности – это бланки, обладающие определенной степенью защиты и используемые для изготовления документов, имеющих финансовую ценность, такие как бланки квитанций, товарно-транспортных накладных, маркированные билеты и прочее. Процедура инвентаризации денежных средств, денежных документов и бланков строгой отчетности включает в себя следующие этапы: 1. Подготовка: Составляется приказ руководителя организации о проведении инвентаризации, формируется инвентаризационная комиссия, разрабатывается график процедур. 2. Подсчет и сверка: Комиссия осуществляет подсчет наличных средств в кассе, проверяет наличие и состояние денежных документов, а также наличие и правильность оформления бланков строгой отчетности. Результаты подсчета сверяются с данными бухгалтерского учета. 3. Фиксация результатов: Результаты инвентаризации заносятся в инвентаризационные описи или акты, которые подписываются всеми членами комиссии. 4. Выводы и мероприятия: В случае выявления расхождений между фактическим наличием и учетными данными комиссия должна выяснить причины этих расхождений и подготовить соответствующие предложения по их устранению. Если выявляются факты хищения или злоупотребления, они документально оформляются и сообщаются руководству организации и в соответствующие органы. 5. Отражение в учете: После утверждения результатов инвентаризации соответствующие корректировки вносятся в бухгалтерский учет. Инвентаризация важна, так как она помогает обеспечить точность и достоверность бухгалтерского учета, предотвращает злоупотребления и помогает сохранять активы организации. В большинстве юрисдикций проведение инвентаризации регулируется законодательством, и организации должны проводить её периодически, часто ежегодно или по особым событиям, таким как смена материально-ответственных лиц, реорганизация предприятия или перед составлением годовой отчетности."},{"prompt":"Write list of chapters for report on topic \\"Malware Defense Evasion techniques\\".

Существует множество типов вредоносных программ, включая вирусы, трояны, черви, шпионское ПО (шпионское программное обеспечение), рекламное ПО (адваре) и программы-вымогатели. Вирусы прикрепляют себя к чистым файлам и распространяются, поражая другие чистые файлы. Троянские программы маскируются под законные программы, но выполняют скрытые вредоносные функции. Черви самореплицируются без прямого взаимодействия с пользователями. Шпионское ПО собирает информацию без ведома пользователя, а рекламное ПО перенаправляет рекламу на зараженный компьютер. Программы-вымогатели блокируют доступ к данным или системам до выполнения требования об оплате. **Понимание механизмов защиты** Защитные механизмы предназначены для предотвращения заражения, обнаружения вредоносной активности и реагирования на угрозы. Они включают антивирусное программное обеспечение, фаерволлы, системы обнаружения вторжений (IDS) и системы предотвращения вторжений (IPS), а также комплексные платформы безопасности (EDR, XDR) и многие другие. Эти инструменты исследуют код, поведение, сетевую активность и системные паттерны для обнаружения потенциальных угроз. **Значение уклонения от защиты для успеха вредоносных программ** Для эффективности вредоносные программы должны избегать обнаружения. Техники уклонения улучшают способность вредоносных программ оставаться незаметными и устойчивыми в условиях защищенной цифровой среды. Например, в обход статического анализа может быть использовано шифрование строк, изменение хеш-сумм и маскировка сетевых вызовов. Технологии, позволяющие избежать динамического вредоносного анализа, включают кореньковые комплекты (rootkit) для скрытия процессов и файлов, а также тайминговые проверки для обнаружения виртуальных и анализаторных сред. **Цели и задачи отчета** Данная работа направлена на изложение различных методов, которые вредоносные программы используют для уклонения от систем защиты. Она познакомит читателя с наиболее актуальными и продвинутыми тактиками уклонения, а также с ответными стратегиями, используемыми для противодействия этим угрозам. Цель отчета — не только информировать о существующем состоянии атак и защит, но и предоставить руководство к действию для разработчиков безопасного программного обеспечения и ИТ-специалистов.

Программисты могут использовать различные техники, включая переименование переменных, изменение потока управления и введение ненужного кода. Упаковка является дополнительным уровнем защиты, когда бинарный файл вредоносного ПО сжимается или шифруется. При выполнении упакованный код распаковывается на лету, что усложняет его анализ статическими инструментами. **Антидизассемблирование и антиотладочные техники** Эти техники направлены на противодействие инструментам дизассемблирования и отладки. Они могут включать в себя изменение точек входа, использование нетрадиционного исполнения инструкций и манипулирование опкодами для сбивания с толку анализаторов. Антиотладочные методы могут обнаруживать наличие отладчика, путем проверки временных меток, идентификации артефактов, связанных с процессами отладки, и внедрения специальных инструкций, которые активируются только при наличии отладчика. **Криптографические техники и полиморфный код** Использование криптографии позволяет скрыть вредоносный код с помощью шифрования, что требует ключа декодирования для его расшифровки и анализа. Полиморфные вирусы каждый раз меняют свой код при инфицировании новой машины, что делает сигнатурное обнаружение практически невозможным. Генераторы полиморфных движков обеспечивают почти бесконечное количество вариантов вредоносного кода. **Исполнение с задержкой и ложные улики** Некоторые вредоносные программы могут преднамеренно задерживать исполнение вредоносного кода или действия, используя различные техники временной задержки или ждут определенные условия перед активацией. Ложные улики включают вставку бессмысленного или неиспользуемого кода, который может вводить в заблуждение инструменты статического анализа и аналитиков. **Ограничения детекции на основе сигнатур** Следуя методам статического анализа, антивирусные программы часто полагаются на базы данных сигнатур для обнаружения известных вредоносных программ. Однако данные техники уклонения демонстрируют, что статический анализ может быть неэффективен против новых или модифицированных вредоносных программ. Адаптация и эволюция вредоносных программ может быстро делать устаревшими базы данных сигнатур, что требует от защитных механизмов непрерывного обновления и улучшения для сохранения актуальности в условиях постоянно меняющейся угрозы.

Chapter structure: Chapter 3: Evasion Techniques Against Dynamic Analysis and Behavioral Detection - Environment and Sandbox Detection - Process Injection and Hollowing - Rootkits and Stealth Mechanisms - Timing-Based Evasion and Sleep Obfuscation - Simulation and Emulation Evasion","completion":"Глава 3: Техники уклонения от динамического анализа и обнаружения по поведению **Обнаружение окружения и песочниц** Вредоносные программы стали достаточно развитыми, чтобы обнаруживать, когда они запускаются в контролируемом аналитическом окружении, например, в песочнице. Они могут искать признаки виртуализации, контрольные суммы процессов и служб, проверять наличие определенного аппаратного обеспечения или применять логические проверки, связанные с человеческим поведением, для подтверждения, что программа работает на реальной машине. **Инъекция процессов и опустошение** Техника, известная как процесс-инъекция, позволяет вредоносной программе вписать себя в адресное пространство другого процесса, маскируя свои действия под легитимную активность. Процесс-опустошение, аналогично, заменяет содержимое нормальных процессов вредоносным кодом, часто после того, как изначальный код был удален или выгружен, создавая видимость, что вредоносные действия исходят из доверенного источника. **Руткиты и механизмы скрытности** Руткиты представляют собой набор технологий, скрывающих факт проникновения и наличия вредоносного ПО в системе. Они могут манипулировать системными вызовами, скрыть файлы, процессы и сетевую активность от пользователя и даже вмешиваться в работу антивирусных программ. Механизмы скрытности обеспечивают долгосрочное выживание вредоносного ПО, укрепляя их защиту от методов динамического анализа. **Тайминг-базированное уклонение и обфускация сна** Некоторые вредоносные программы используют тайминг-базированные методы для уклонения от обнаружения. Это может включать в себя продолжительные ожидания или сна через неожиданные интервалы, чтобы избежать активности во время анализа или обнаружить процедуры обнаружения времени исполнения. Обфускация сна может вводить в заблуждение исследователей, имитируя периоды неактивности, которые обычно не связаны с вредоносной активностью. **Уклонение от симуляции и эмуляции** Сложные вредоносные программы могут обнаруживать, когда их исполняемый код подвергается симуляции или эмуляции — методам, обычно применяемым для динамического анализа. Они могут обходиться без выполнения вредоносных функций или изменять свое поведение в зависимости от обнаружения поддельного окружения, затрудняя точное предсказание их действий в реальном мире. Эти техники уклонения подчеркивают необходимость постоянного совершенствования средств обнаружения и реагирования на вредоносные программы. Только с помощью продвинутых динамических аналитических инструментов, способных учитывать вышеуказанные тактики уклонения, можно адекватно противостоять современным угрозам и защитить информационную среду от них."},{"prompt":"Write last chapter 4 (conclusion) of report “Malware Defense Evasion techniques”.

Its political ideologies have evolved over time, but several key elements have been consistent throughout its history: 1. Nationalism: The KMT has been a staunch advocate of Chinese nationalism with the goal of fostering a strong, unified Chinese state. Initially, this meant overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and ending imperial rule, and later it meant resisting Japanese imperialism during the Second Sino-Japanese War. 2. Three Principles of the People: The KMT was founded on Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, which are: - Nationalism (民族主義) - aimed at the establishment of a sovereign, independent China free from foreign domination. - Democracy (民權主義) - focused on the development of a democratic government based on the will of the people. - People's Livelihood (民生主義) - centered on the idea of economic development, social welfare, and equitable distribution of wealth. 3. Authoritarianism: Under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek and during the early years of the Republic of China in Taiwan, the KMT was known for its authoritarian rule, prioritizing political stability and economic development over political freedoms. This period is known as the \\"White Terror,\\" during which thousands of political dissidents were persecuted. 4. Anti-Communism: For much of its history, especially during and after the Chinese Civil War, the KMT has been sharply opposed to communism. This ideological battle against the Chinese Communist Party was a defining feature of the KMT, leading to their retreat to Taiwan after losing the mainland. 5. Modern Conservatism: In contemporary Taiwan, the KMT has adopted more conservative social and economic policies, advocating for free markets, a pro-business environment, and generally preferring a more traditional and gradual approach to social change. 6. Cross-Strait Relations: The KMT has historically advocated for closer ties with mainland China based on the \\"1992 Consensus,\\" which acknowledges the existence of \\"one China\\" but allows for different interpretations of what that means. They support the idea of eventual reunification but under a democratic system that respects the freedoms of the Taiwanese people. 7. Social Welfare: In recent years, the party has also focused on social welfare issues, recognizing the importance of a safety net for the disadvantaged, while still maintaining an overall market-oriented economic stance. It is important to recognize that these broad ideologies can change over time and may differ among KMT members and leadership. Moreover, as with any major political party, internal factions and varying interpretations of the party's principles can lead to a range of positions on specific policies and issues."},{"prompt":"Доклад по физике на тему \\"Световые явления\\". Примерный объем >500 слов","completion":"Тема: \\"Световые явления\\" Вступление: Свет - это форма энергии, которая играет важную роль в жизни на Земле и во вселенной. Световые явления рассматриваются в рамках оптики - раздела физики, изучающего свойства и природу света. Световые явления охватывают широкий спектр тем от простых (отражение и преломление) до сложных (интерференция и дифракция). Давайте рассмотрим несколько ключевых световых явлений и объясним их физические основы. Отражение света: Отражение света является одним из базовых световых явлений, которое мы наблюдаем в повседневной жизни, например, когда видим свое отражение в зеркале. Это процесс возвращения светового луча в исходную среду при его встрече с границей раздела двух различных сред. Закон отражения гласит, что угол падения равен углу отражения, причём оба угла измеряются относительно перпендикуляра к поверхности отражения. Преломление света: Преломление - это изменение направления распространения света при его переходе из одной среды в другую. Это явление объясняется законом Снеллиуса, который описывает зависимость угла падения и угла преломления через показатели преломления обеих сред. Преломление лежит в основе работы линз и объясняет, например, почему предметы под водой кажутся смещенными. Дисперсия света: Дисперсия света - явление разделения белого света на составляющие его цвета при прохождении через прозрачную среду, например, призму. Суть дисперсии заключается в зависимости показателя преломления материала от длины волны света, вследствие чего различные цвета света преломляются под разными углами. Интерференция света: Интерференция - это явление наложения двух или более волн, в результате чего возникает новый распределённый узор интенсивности волн. Для света это может проявляться в виде полос пониженной или повышенной яркости. Интерференционные картины были ключевым доказательством волновой природы света. Один из самых известных экспериментов по изучению интерференции – эксперимент Юнга с двойной щелью, демонстрирующий дифракционную картину. Дифракция света: Дифракция - это явление отклонения света от прямолинейного пути, возникающее при прохождении вблизи препятствий или через узкие отверстия. Свет, огибая края препятствия или пройдя через щель, создает сложные узоры яркости и темноты. Дифракция также свидетельствует о волновой природе света. Поляризация света: Поляризация - это явление, при котором волны света ориентируются в определенной плоскости. В естественном свете колебания электромагнитного поля происходят во всех возможных плоскостях, перпендикулярных направлению распространения. При прохождении через поляризатор колебания «выбираются» только в одной плоскости, что и создает поляризованный свет. Фотоэлектрический эффект: Это явление, при котором электроны выбиваются из материала под действием света. Явление фотоэлектрического эффекта подтвердило корпускулярную теорию света и было объяснено Альбертом Эйнштейном, что принесло ему Нобелевскую премию. Это открытие положило начало квантовой физике и сыграло ключевую роль в развитии современной электроники и оптоэлектроники. Заключение: Световые явления находят применение во многих областях, начиная от медицинской диагностики и заканчивая технологиями связи. Изучение света и его явлений способствует глубокому пониманию фундаментальных законов природы и открывает возможности для новых технологических разработок, улучшая нашу повседневную жизнь."},{"prompt":"How do i set the color of <HiArrowRight className=\\"absolute text-4xl group-hover:translate-x-2 transition-all duration-300\\" aria-hidden /> to #f13024","completion":"It seems that you are using JSX syntax to render icons, which is commonly done in React-based projects. The \`HiArrowRight\` might be an icon component from a library like Heroicons. To set the color of the \`HiArrowRight\` icon to \`#f13024\`, you can apply the color using inline styles or CSS classes. Here's how you could do it with inline styles: \`\`\`jsx <HiArrowRight className=\\"absolute text-4xl group-hover:translate-x-2 transition-all duration-300\\" style={{ color: '#f13024' }} aria-hidden=\\"true\\" /> \`\`\` And here's how you can apply the color using a CSS class: First, define a CSS class in your stylesheet (\`styles.css\` or similar): \`\`\`css .icon-color { color: #f13024; } \`\`\` Then, apply the CSS class to your icon component: \`\`\`jsx <HiArrowRight className=\\"absolute text-4xl group-hover:translate-x-2 transition-all duration-300 icon-color\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" /> \`\`\` In the second method, I have added the class \`icon-color\` to the existing list of classes. When the styles are processed, the color \`#f13024\` should be applied to the icon. Make sure that you include the stylesheet where you defined \`.icon-color\` in your project so that the styles are applied correctly."},{"prompt":"I also want to add a Label to the arrow that says DESIGNS in the Same color","completion":"To add a label with the text \\"DESIGNS\\" next to the \`HiArrowRight\` icon and color both with \`#f13024\`, you can wrap the icon and a \`<span>\` element for the text inside a container and apply the styles to both. Here's an example using React JSX: First, update your CSS (if you're using an external stylesheet): \`\`\`css .icon-and-label-color { color: #f13024; } \`\`\` Next, structure your JSX code with the new label and apply the class to both the icon and the text: \`\`\`jsx <div className=\\"icon-and-label\\"> <HiArrowRight className=\\"absolute text-4xl group-hover:translate-x-2 transition-all duration-300 icon-and-label-color\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" /> <span className=\\"icon-and-label-color\\">DESIGNS</span> </div> \`\`\` Ensure that the text aligns with the icon as desired. You might need additional styling depending on your layout requirements. For instance, additional classes can be used to control the positioning and alignment, like this: \`\`\`jsx <div className=\\"flex items-center space-x-2\\"> {/* Adjust the space as needed */} <HiArrowRight className=\\"text-4xl group-hover:translate-x-2 transition-all duration-300 icon-and-label-color\\" aria-hidden=\\"true\\" /> <span className=\\"text-base font-medium icon-and-label-color\\">DESIGNS</span> </div> \`\`\` In this updated snippet: - I removed the \`absolute\` class since absolute positioning might interfere with the label placement next to the icon. - I wrapped both elements inside a \`div\` with \`flex\` and \`items-center\` to horizontally align them and \`space-x-2\` to add some space between. - I added additional classes \`text-base font-medium\` to the \`span\` to style the text, but you may adjust these classes according to your needs or remove them if you want to keep the default styles. Remember to import the stylesheet that contains the \`.icon-and-label-color\` class into your component or root application file so the styles are applied correctly."},{"prompt":"Type","completion":"It seems like you may have accidentally sent your message before finishing your thought.

As the intensity grew unbearable, her hand gravitated to the nape of his neck, her fingers intertwining with his hair in desperation. Grabbing thick strands between her knuckles , she formed a solid grip against his scalp, breathing deeply as her muscles spasmed with fury. In response, he placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen. Applying counterpressure to the undercurve of her stomach, he urged, “You already are; she’s almost here. Keep pushing, Elara. Just let it happen.” With every fibre of her being, she strained against his bracing hand, her breath filling the air; the room seemed to fall away as Max let his head follow her urgent pull. As she released the push, the child’s head crowning, Max locked eyes with her as she dropped her forehead against his. “Look at me, Elara; she’s almost here.

Just as another contraction swept through her, a voice pierced through her veil of agony, halting her preparation to push yet again: “Her heart rate is dropping—breathe, Elara. Don’t push,” a nurse instructed as Elara buried her head in the curve of Max’s shoulder, shaking with exhaustion. “Max—no—I need—” Max’s heart raced through his veins as he held his deep hazel stare on Elara’s uncertain blue gaze, maintaining his pressure against her trembling abdomen. “Just focus on me, and only me. Now pant, Elara, she’s so close—” Her punctured gasps fell against his neck, and pulling his scalp downwards; her lips found his as he caught her agonized moan in his mouth. She kissed him frantically, then released a gasp as the urge to push consumed her, and she bore down, her fingernails tearing into his hair. “That’s it, Elara, her heart rate is coming up. Push her down. She’s in full crown; one deep push, Elara,” the nurse encouraged, and Max embraced her, his voice hoarse. “Look at me, Elara; we’re doing this. One more push and she’s here.” The atmosphere, shrinking inward as the anticipation and urgency mounted, drew closer like cling wrap as Elara’s primal effort reverberated through Max’s core, her hands guiding his mouth to her cheek, his lips falling against her heated skin. “That’s it, Elara…” he urged, with a sense of pride and awe, adrenaline coursing through his chest. As the baby’s head emerged and her body slid out with a rush of blood and amniotic fluid, the room fell silent, a cold sense of dread enveloping them both. “She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror , and he wrapped his arms around her. “Our baby, she’s—she’s not crying—Max—”. Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs that bound Max in a moment of panic, stooped completely . As a nurse placed their daughter fragile , almost transparent body against Elara’s chest , she explained “the skin to skin contact will encourage her to cry, her airways are clear , Elara.

As she released the push, the child’s head crowning, Max locked eyes with her as she dropped her forehead against his. “Look at me, Elara; she’s almost here. You’re doing so well.” As her uterus clenched with brutal force, outlining their baby’s head, Max ran a steady palm over her navel, maintaining the pressure she craved. “Push, Elara, I’ve got you,” he reassured her as she wound her hand through his hair, and the intensity of the moment consumed them both. Just as another contraction swept through her, a voice pierced through her veil of agony, halting her preparation to push yet again: “Her heart rate is dropping—breathe, Elara. Don’t push,” a nurse instructed as Elara buried her head in the curve of Max’s shoulder, shaking with exhaustion. “Max—no—I need—” Max’s heart raced through his veins as he held his deep hazel stare on Elara’s uncertain blue gaze, maintaining his pressure against her trembling abdomen. “Just focus on me and only me. Now pant, Elara, she’s so close—” Her punctured gasps fell against his neck, and pulling his scalp downwards, her lips found his as he caught her agonized moan in his mouth. She kissed him frantically, then released a gasp as the urge to push consumed her, and she bore down, her fingernails tearing into his hair. “That’s it, Elara, her heart rate is coming up. Push her down. She’s in full crown; one deep push, Elara,” the nurse encouraged, and Max embraced her, his voice hoarse. “Look at me, Elara; we’re doing this. One more push and she’s here.” The atmosphere, shrinking inward as the anticipation and urgency mounted, drew closer like cling wrap as Elara’s primal effort reverberated through Max’s core, her hands guiding his mouth to her cheek, his lips falling against her heated skin. “That’s it, Elara…” he urged, with a sense of pride and awe, adrenaline coursing through his chest. As the baby’s head emerged and her body slid out with a rush of blood and amniotic fluid, the room fell silent, a cold sense of dread enveloping them both. “She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror, and he wrapped his arms around her. “Our baby, she’s—she’s not crying—Max—”. Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs that bound Max in a moment of panic, stopped completely. As a nurse placed their daughter’s fragile, almost transparent body against Elara’s chest, she explained, “The skin-to-skin contact will encourage her to cry, her airways are clear, Elara. Hold your baby; she’ll breathe soon.” The next moment, as her baby’s blue lips broke her resolve, Elara turned away, crying into the hollow of Max’s sternum. Max gazed at his motionless child, willing her to respire, “Come on, baby girl, fill those lungs.” His own breathing, ragged and filled with his escalating fear, caused him to lower his gaze into Elara’s shoulder as the tension wrought through his chest. “Please cry,” he murmured, his plea merging with Elara’s exhausted tears. Then, as if on cue, a wail tore through the air, vibrant and healthy, and alive. Lifting his head, Max’s weathered eyes washed over with relief, and Elara gazed at her child with awestruck tenderness. “Thank God—” she laughed through her tears, placing a hand on the child’s back, rubbing soothing circles into her violet skin. Collapsing into Elara’s clavicle and smiling broadly, Max let a moment of unbridled joy overwhelm him, a few tears falling onto her skin. “You did it, Elara—I’m so proud of you both—” Elara kept both hands encapsulated around her now crying daughter, her lips again finding Max’s, as he delivered a rough kiss and then whispered, “What are we going to name her? We can’t call her ‘gorgeous’ forever.” Elara laughed in response, “You know the name we chose, but trust you to forget in all the madness—” Max retorted quickly as his smile only widened with wit and mischief, “I did not forget.

One more push and she’s here.” The atmosphere, shrinking inward as the anticipation and urgency mounted, drew closer like cling wrap as Elara’s primal effort reverberated through Max’s core, her hands guiding his mouth to her cheek, his lips falling against her heated skin. “That’s it, Elara…” he urged, with a sense of pride and awe, adrenaline coursing through his chest. As the baby’s head emerged and her body slid out with a rush of blood and amniotic fluid, the room fell silent, a cold sense of dread enveloping them both. “She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror, and he wrapped his arms around her. “Our baby, she’s—she’s not crying—Max—”. Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs that bound Max in a moment of panic, stopped completely. As a nurse placed their daughter’s fragile, almost transparent body against Elara’s chest, she explained, “The skin-to-skin contact will encourage her to cry, her airways are clear, Elara. Hold your baby; she’ll breathe soon.” The next moment, as her baby’s blue lips broke her resolve, Elara turned away, crying into the hollow of Max’s sternum. Max gazed at his motionless child, willing her to breathe, “Come on, baby girl, fill those lungs.” His own breathing, ragged and filled with his escalating fear, caused him to lower his gaze into Elara’s shoulder as the tension wrought through his chest. “Please cry,” he murmured, his plea merging with Elara’s exhausted tears. Then, as if on cue, a wail tore through the air, vibrant and healthy, and alive. Lifting his head, Max’s weathered eyes washed over with relief, and Elara gazed at her child with awestruck tenderness. “Thank God—” she laughed through her tears, placing a hand on the child’s back, rubbing soothing circles into her violet skin. Collapsing into Elara’s clavicle and smiling broadly, Max let a moment of unbridled joy overwhelm him, a few tears of their own falling onto her skin. “You did it, Elara—I’m so proud of you both—” Elara kept both hands wrapped around her now crying daughter, her lips again finding Max’s, as he delivered a rough kiss and then whispered, “What are we going to name her? We can’t call her ‘gorgeous’ forever.” Elara laughed in response, “You know the name we chose, but trust you to forget in all the madness—” Max retorted quickly as his smile only widened with wit and mischief, “I did not forget. Welcome to the world, Lily.”","completion":"Elara’s fingers grazed the warm skin below Max’s wrist as she searched for his anchoring touch, and he interlocked his palm with hers as she bore down on his knuckles. “I’m right here; you’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered in a low tone, resting his forehead against hers. “I can’t, Max, I can’t—” she panted, her face flushed, with a sheen of perspiration gleaming on her cheekbones as she gasped against his neck. As the intensity grew unbearable, her hand moved to the nape of his neck, her fingers intertwining with his hair in desperation. He placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen and applied counterpressure. “You already are; she’s almost here. Keep pushing, Elara. Just let it happen,” he urged. With every fiber of her being, she strained against his bracing hand, her breath filling the air; the room seemed to fall away as Max let his head follow her urgent pull. As she released the push, the child’s head crowning, Max locked eyes with her, she dropped her forehead against his. “Look at me, Elara; she’s almost here. You’re doing so well.” As her uterus clenched with brutal force, outlining their baby’s head, Max ran a steady palm over her navel, maintaining the pressure she craved. “Push, Elara, I’ve got you,” he reassured her as she wound her hand through his hair, and the intensity of the moment consumed them both. Just as another contraction swept through her, a voice pierced through her veil of agony, halting her preparations to push yet again: “Her heart rate is dropping—breathe, Elara. Don’t push,” a nurse instructed as Elara buried her head in the curve of Max’s shoulder, shaking with exhaustion. “Max—no—I need—” Max’s heart raced through his veins as he held his deep hazel gaze on Elara’s uncertain blue eyes, maintaining his pressure against her trembling abdomen. “Just focus on me, and only me. Now pant, Elara, she’s so close—” Her punctuated gasps fell against his neck, and pulling his scalp downward, her lips found his as he caught her agonized moan in his mouth.

However, for clarity and coherence in presenting the scene, I recommend retaining the edited and corrected passage, which smoothed out the grammar and punctuation without significantly changing the original wording. It achieves a balance between emotional depth and writing quality, avoiding potential reader confusion that might arise from typographical errors or less polished structure. The edited passage retains the core strengths of vivid imagery, intense emotion, and character development present in the original while enhancing comprehensibility. The natural flow of dialogue and narrative allows readers to be more fully immersed in the experience without being pulled away by distractions related to form or syntax. In sum, the edited passage offers a clearer, more polished version of the emotionally charged scene while preserving the spirit of the original."},{"prompt":"Random cute pokemon, one word with pokemon before it","completion":"Pokemon Eevee"},{"prompt":"Дени.

Integration with Western institutions and NATO dialogue (views which in later years may have evolved or been toned down due to the changing political climate between Russia and the West). It is essential to note that the political landscape in Russia is dynamic, and political figures may adjust their stances based on the changing political, social, and economic context.

They typically uphold the achievements of the Soviet Union under Lenin and Stalin. 2. **Socialism and Communism**: The party promotes the establishment of a socialist state as a precursor to a communist society, wherein means of production are commonly owned, and the state operates in the interests of the working class. 3. **Social Justice**: Similar to other socialist and communist parties, the KPRF emphasizes reducing inequality through wealth redistribution, social welfare, and measures to protect the working class. 4. **Opposition to Liberal Capitalism**: The KPRF often criticizes the economic and political reforms that followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union, deploring the move towards a market economy and advocating for a return to a planned economy. 5. **Patriotism and Russian Nationalism**: Unlike many Western left-wing parties, the KPRF combines socialist policies with a strong sense of Russian nationalism and patriotism, maintaining a respect for Russia's historical achievements and cultural heritage. 6. **State Sovereignty and Anti-Globalism**: The party typically opposes globalization tendencies that could undermine Russian sovereignty and are critical of international institutions that promote liberal economic policies. 7. **Foreign Policy**: The KPRF is critical of NATO's eastward expansion and typically opposes what it sees as American imperialism. It favors closer ties with countries that resist U.S. hegemony. 8. **Conservatism in Social Policies**: In terms of social policies, the KPRF can be conservative, defending traditional Russian cultural and social norms. It's important to note that the KPRF operates in the context of the current Russian political system, where meaningful opposition to the ruling party, United Russia, is limited. The KPRF often participates in elections and has a presence in the State Duma (Russian Parliament), but also faces allegations of being a \\"systemic opposition\\"—an opposition that is partially tolerated by the authorities and does not pose a real threat to the Kremlin's authoritarian rule. Of course, these positions and how they're expressed can evolve over time, and they resonate with varying degrees of intensity among the party's base."},{"prompt":"give me 50 ideas that solve some problem as a university school project in french","completion":"Here are 50 project ideas in French, each one designed to solve a particular problem: 1.

He was a librarian in his mid-30s, a gaunt man with a sallow complexion and dark circles under his pale blue eyes, which flickered with the subdued light of a solitary existence. The endless stacks of books were his refuge, a place where whispers of the past mingled with the scent of old paper, providing a familiar solace against the ever-churning uncertainty outside. He lived alone in a modest house that stood on a quiet cul-de-sac in the suburbs, tucked away from the bustle of the city. It was a deliberate choice, one that offered him the illusion of control in a world that seemed increasingly chaotic. Liam was content, or at least that's what he told himself, chanting the words like a mantra each night before he suc*****bed to fitful sleep. But this morning, something had shifted. Liam awoke with a start, his heart pounding against the cage of his ribs. A thread of ice ran down his spine as he lay in the gray embrace of dawn's early light, the shadows in his room stretching like long fingers reaching across the walls. The air felt charged, as if the very atoms were holding their breath in anticipation of some unfathomable event. As he got up from the tangled mess of his bedsheets, a growing sense of unease gnawed at him. It was too quiet, the natural symphony of rustling leaves and distant traffic absent. Even the chirping of the birds, which usually greeted the sunrise with their melodic chatter, was missing. It was as if the world had been muted, save for the sound of his own ragged breathing and the thump of his heartbeat echoing in his ears. Liam approached the window with trepidation, his pale fingers trembling as they parted the moth-eaten curtains. The sight that met his eyes caused a shiver to run through him. The street outside laid bare, empty cars sitting parked and abandoned. No joggers on their morning run, no neighbors walking their dogs, no signs of life at all. It was as if the rapture had come, whisking away the population, leaving only silence in its wake. Compelled by a morbid curiosity and the pressing weight of the unknown, Liam dressed in haste and stepped outside. The air was cool, carrying with it the bitter tang of something metallic, a scent that made him think of blood and rust. The sun rose in the horizon, a distant, apathetic observer to the eerie tableau below. As Liam walked down the street, his footsteps sounded unnaturally loud, every scuff of his shoe a gunshot in the oppressive stillness. The houses on either side stood as silent sentinels, their curtained windows like unblinking eyes that refused to reveal their secrets. He reached the corner where Mrs. Langley's garden should have been buzzing with bees, but there was nothing. The flowers swayed gently in a nonexistent breeze, their vibrant colors a stark contrast to the desolation. A prickle of fear coiled tighter in his stomach, slithering up his spine and whispering warnings in his ears. Liam rounded the corner, his pace accelerating despite his intention to remain calm. He had to find someone, anyone, a living soul that could dispel this nightmare. The grocery store, a place usually bustling with activity, loomed ahead like a mausoleum. The automatic doors whooshed open as he approached, the sound echoing into the void beyond. Inside, the fluorescent lights flickered, throwing a sickly glow over empty aisles. The familiar music that always played from the hidden speakers was absent, leaving behind a void that suffocated. Cans were lined in perfect rows, fruits lay untouched in their bins, and the bakery's pastries sat uneaten. All of it was just as it should be, except for the absence of life; it was a still-life painting crafted by a madman. As he wandered through the ghost of a grocery store, he felt the weight of countless unseen eyes upon him. Liam was struck by a sensation that something else was present, something that thrived in the lifelessness that enveloped the town, something that watched with predatory patience. Turning to flee the store, he glimpsed his reflection in a freezer door. For a moment, he scarcely recognized the ashen-faced figure with wide, terror-stricken eyes. Then, with a start, Liam noticed something else—a shadow, a subtle distortion in the air behind him, barely noticeable but unmistakably there. His blood turned to ice, and he resisted the urge to look back, to confront whatever thing had crept into existence. He dashed out of the store, his breath coming in sharp, ragged gasps as he plunged into the unearthly silence that covered the town like a shroud. The unspoken terror had become palpable, hanging in the air like a miasma that clung to his skin. Liam was alone, dreadfully alone in a world gone silent, with the unsettling knowledge that perhaps, he might not be as alone as he feared."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter","completion":"Chapter 2: Whispers in the Void Liam’s sense of reality unraveled with each frantic step he took away from the store. The quiet was no longer just an absence of sound—it was a living thing, surging behind him in suffocating waves. His breaths were shallow, each inhalation a gasp against the weight of stillness pressing into his lungs. He blindly turned corners in the maze of deserted streets, yearning for the safety of his home, though he knew deep down that safety was a fantasy now. Behind shuttered windows and locked doors, the homes of his neighbors kept their secrets. In the pervading silence, Liam's footsteps began to sound alien, like the tread of a stranger's boots muffled by the fog of a dream. His thoughts darted back to the shadow in the reflection, gnawing at the edges of his mind. He couldn’t rationalize it—was it a trick of his frantic mind, or something far more sinister? It clung to him, the idea of a presence just beyond perception, toying with the tattered fringes of his sanity. The screech of a gate swinging abruptly on its hinges ripped through the silence. Liam’s pulse thrummed in his temples as he spun toward the noise. There, in a narrow alley between two hushed houses, the rusted gate wavered back and forth as if disturbed by an unseen hand. A black cat, the street’s sole other inhabitant, watched him with luminous yellow eyes before slinking away, blending smoothly into the shadows. “Hello?” Liam’s voice was hoarse, the first sound spoken aloud seeming alien in the quietude. It was swallowed by the still air, unanswered. The eerie stillness crept back in, flooding over the space his words had briefly occupied. Gathering his courage, Liam inched towards the gate, the metal cool and real under the uncertain touch of his fingers. The garden beyond lay shrouded in the tendrils of early morning mist, and for a moment, Liam was transfixed by the swirling patterns of the fog as it danced in sluggish circles around a stone birdbath. Then, just as he was about to turn back, he heard it—a soft murmur, a distorted utterance that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere all at once. It teased at the edges of his hearing, beckoning him deeper into the alley. He knew he ought to run, return to his house, barricade himself inside with his books and pretend the world outside had not transformed into a spectral landscape. But the whispers wound around him, through him, tugging at a part of Liam that he could not ignore. That same part that could sense the subtle shifts in life's fabric, that noticed the flickering shadow when others would have seen an empty reflection. His legs moved of their own volition, carrying him past the gate and into the garden beyond. The whispers grew louder as he ventured deeper, shaping themselves into unintelligible phrases that seemed to lick at the fringes of his comprehension, repellent yet seductive in their elusive meaning. Thick vines crawled up the sides of the nearest house like desperate fingers clawing for the heavens, and as Liam's eyes traced their path upwards, he noticed a window on the second floor swing quietly open. And there, silhouetted against the gloomy interior, was the vague outline of a person—or something that might once have been. For a heartbeat, he thought they might make eye contact, if such a thing was possible with a shadow. But the figure recoiled abruptly and vanished from his view, leaving behind a chilling feeling that Liam had witnessed a forbidden exchange. A clatter from behind startled him back to grim immediacy, and as he spun around, searching for the source, he saw nothing but the shifting fog and barren flora. His head snapped back towards the window, but it was now firmly shut, as though the encounter had been nothing but a figment of his distraught mind. Liam's sprint home was primal, his feet slapping the pavement, breath tearing at his throat. He no longer cared about the sound he made; the silence had become his enemy, a predator that stalked with infinite patience. When he slammed his front door shut, the echo boomed through the house like a gunshot. Leaning against the wood, Liam let his racing heart slow, let the sweat cool on his brow. The whispering was gone, but the feeling of being watched remained, etched into him like invisible ink. This was no longer the world he knew, and that realization clawed at the remnants of his peace with talons of ice. Silence had fallen like a shroud over his quiet suburb, and the terror that came with it whispered to him from the shadows—of days to come, of nights filled with unblinking eyes and forms lurking just beyond sight. Liam understood now that whatever was happening, he was entangled within its web. The question that pulsed through his fogged mind as the unnatural daylight crept into the edges of his home was clear and haunting: What has happened to my world, and who—or what—remains with me in the darkness?"},{"prompt":"write the next chapter","completion":"Chapter 3: Secrets Behind Closed Doors A strange stillness hovered in the house, oppressive and thick. Liam leaned his head against the door, still feeling the throb of his frantic pulse in his temples. In the uncertain refuge of his home, he was surrounded by the echoes of a life that now felt alien and distant. The rooms were filled with shadows that seemed to swell and contract with each breath he took, as if the house itself was alive with a slow, deliberate pulse. Liam’s mind whirled with the memories of silent streets, the shadowed figure, and the whispering voices that had led him down the garden path. None of it made sense, yet the terror that had gripped him was vivid, palpable in its intensity. He had to make sense of the events. There had to be a logical explanation. A gas leak causing hallucinations, a secret government drill, anything that could be cataloged and filed away into the cabinets of reason and rational thought. With a shaking hand, he pushed away from the door and began to pace the length of his living room, his eyes catching on the familiar spines of his books. Their presence was a lifeline to normalcy, and he felt an overwhelming urge to lose himself in their pages, to bury his fears in the quiet comfort of other people's stories. Instead, he made his way to the bookshelf, collecting volumes on local history and lore. If there was anything to be understood about what was happening, it could be hidden in the folklore and forgotten tales of the town. Liam settled himself into his worn leather armchair, the dim glow of the table lamp doing little to banish the creeping gloom that filled the corners of the room. Hours passed as he read, his eyes scanning text for mentions of strange occurrences, local legends, or even cryptic references to unusual phenomena. He found little, aside from a few ghost stories and a medieval account of a day when the village was said to have gone silent, only to resume as normal with the morning sun—no explanation given, none needed in an age of superstition. It was a footnote, a curiosity, and yet it clung to Liam like a cobweb. Just as he was about to relent to fatigue, a detail caught his eye—a reference to an enigmatic brotherhood that was rumored to have operated in the area centuries ago. They were said to be guardians of a profound silence, keepers of a sacred hush that could not be broken, lest catastrophic events befall the world. There was no name given to the group, and the source was dubious at best, but it struck a chord within Liam's already rattled psyche. Could it be that he was caught in the middle of some ancient ritual, a forgotten practice reborn in the modern day? The idea was far-fetched, bordering on absurd, but so was the void of life outside his door. Liam set the book down, a headache blooming behind his eyes. Sleep beckoned, promising escape from the maddening riddles that circled in his head like vultures. Yet, as he made his way to his bedroom, he couldn't shake the feeling of eyes upon him, of hidden figures watching from a place just out of sight. He closed the bedroom door softly behind him, the click of the latch unnaturally loud. The bed welcomed him with its cold sheets, a stark contrast to the warmth he had always taken for granted. Liam closed his eyes, though sleep was an elusive specter, dancing just out of reach. Each creak of the house became the footstep of an intruder; every sigh of wind against the window was a whisper meant only for his ears. In the grips of a restless half-sleep, Liam's thoughts drifted back to the figure in the window. Why had it seemed so familiar, so impossibly familiar? And why did it recoil at the sight of him, as though he were the harbinger of some grave misfortune? The night wore on, each minute crawling by with the heavy weight of dread. When slumber finally claimed him, it was fitful and dark. Dreams of empty streets and silent skies swirled through his mind, punctuated by a sound he could barely discern—a gentle, persistent knocking. It was still dark when Liam awoke with a start. The knocking had followed him into the waking world, a soft but insistent tap tap tap on the front door. Someone was out there, beyond the threshold of his sanctuary—someone, or something, that refused to let the night pass unwitnessed. With a tremor of unease, Liam rose from his bed, moving towards the sound that shattered the unnatural stillness of his once peaceful home. It was a summoning, a call that could not be ignored. He reached the door, his hand hovering over the knob. The knocks continued, patient and rhythmic. Taking a deep breath, Liam turned the handle, ready to face the unknown that waited on the other side."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter","completion":"Chapter 4: The Summoning Knock The creak of the door seemed to Liam as if he were unlocking a gateway to another realm. A cool gust of wind brushed his face, carrying with it the scent of the unknown. As the door swung open, hesitant light from the slumbering sun strained through the clouds, casting long, sinister shadows across the porch. There, on the doorstep, stood a figure shrouded in a heavy cloak. Despite their obscured face, their posture conveyed an urgency that set Liam's nerves on edge. A hood cast their features in darkness, but from within that obscurity, a pair of eyes peered out—not threatening, but imploring, desperate. \\"Help,\\" the figure rasped, the voice a mere thread of sound that wound its way into Liam's ears and rooted itself deep within his chest. Liam's throat tightened, but he managed to reply, \\"Who are you? What's happened here?\\" The stranger stepped forward, just enough to be enveloped by the thin veil of light from within the house. They were older than Liam had initially thought, their skin weathered by time and elements. \\"Not here,\\" the stranger said. \\"We mustn't speak of it on the threshold. May I enter?\\" A thousand cautionary tales screamed at Liam to refuse, but the gnawing curiosity and the palpable distress in the stranger's voice compelled him to step aside. As the stranger entered, their presence seemed to fill the space, and the silence retreated like the tide before a tsunami. The stranger removed their hood, revealing thin, silver hair and a face mapped with wrinkles. Eyes the color of storm clouds met Liam's gaze, holding a sorrow older than the hills. \\"You need to understand what is happening,\\" they said, their voice firmer now, but still lacking any echo in the still air of the home. Liam's fingers trembled. \\"Then tell me.\\" \\"I belonged to the Brotherhood of Silence,\\" the figure began, confirming Liam's suspicions. Their voice held a tremor of regret, or perhaps fear. \\"We are—were—guardians of something that should never have been disturbed.\\" \\"What?\\" Liam pressed, feeling like a child asking for a bedtime story he knows will give him nightmares. \\"A quietude,\\" the stranger whispered. \\"A silent force, ancient and powerful, sealed away long ago. Our brotherhood has kept watch over it, ensuring it remained undisturbed. But now something—or someone—has released it.\\" \\"But why? How? Why is everyone gone?\\" Liam took a seat, the air suddenly feeling too dense to support him standing. \\"We believe someone unleashed it intentionally, seeking its power without understanding it. It has consumed them, the town, everyone, and everything it touches. It is a silence that doesn't simply quiet sound—it devours it, along with the essence of life.\\" Liam shook his head in disbelief. \\"But you're still here. So am I.\\" The stranger nodded solemnly. \\"Because you are sensitive to the shifts, and I am protected by my vows, though I don't know for how long. Together, we must find the source and reseal the quietude before it swallows everything.\\" Fear gnawed at Liam, yet within him a determination grew. This stranger had come to him for a reason. They believed he could help, and if there was even a sliver of a chance to undo this eerie apocalypse, he felt obligated to try. \\"What do I need to do?\\" Liam asked, his voice steadier than he felt. \\"We must find the epicenter, the place where the quietude was released. I can guide us, but once there...\\" The stranger's gaze faltered, and for a moment, they appeared as vulnerable as a child themselves. \\"Once there, what?\\" \\"It will be a challenge of both will and wits,\\" the stranger declared. \\"You must anchor yourself to sound, to memory and life. You will confront the silence, and you must not let it consume you as it has the others.\\" Chilled to the bone but fueled by a purpose beyond his own survival, Liam slowly stood. He faced the stranger, their eyes locking in an unspoken pact. \\"I'll do it,\\" he said, with no idea how he would succeed—or if they even stood a chance. But buried within him, beneath layers of doubt and fear, lay a kernel of hope. And hope, Liam realized, was a sound loud enough to challenge even the most profound of silences. Together, they stepped into the graying dawn, moving towards the heart of the stillness, where the fate of their world hung in the balance, shrouded by an ominous and devouring quiet."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter","completion":"Chapter 5: Into the Heart of Stillness The stranger introduced themselves as Malcolm, and as they walked side by side down the abandoned streets, he recounted tales of the Brotherhood and their centuries-long vigil. His voice was a lifeline for Liam, a human sound in the midst of overwhelming silence, each word a bulwark against the encroaching void. Liam learned that the Brotherhood was founded on the principle that silence held power, the power of potential and the seed of creation. But corrupting that silence, breaking the seal that contained its raw force, could unravel the tapestry of existence itself. They stopped at a crossroad that once bustled with life, the traffic lights still cycling through their colors with robotic indifference. Malcolm paused, closing his eyes as if to listen to something beyond the reach of normal hearing. \\"It's near,\\" he said after a moment, his brow furrowed in concentration. \\"The quietude expands outward from its source, like ripples in a pond. We must find the stone that broke the surface.\\" \\"How will we know where to look?\\" Liam asked, feeling utterly unprepared for the task before him. \\"By its absence,\\" Malcolm replied cryptically. Taking a deep breath, he pointed towards the heart of the city. \\"There. We go there.\\" As they drew closer to the city center, the heavy blanket of silence seemed to press down on them with greater force, almost tangible in its oppression. Buildings towered over them, their windows dark and sightless like the eyes of the dead. They arrived at the central library—an edifice of stone and glass that Liam knew well. It was his temple of knowledge, a place where he had spent countless hours in the company of books and quiet contemplation. Now it stood as the epicenter of an unnatural hush. \\"This is where it began,\\" Malcolm said, his voice barely louder than a breath, his face etched with anguish. \\"How can we stop it?\\" The question felt hollow in Liam's throat, knowing that the power they faced could very well consume them as easily as it had the rest of the town. \\"With a relic,\\" Malcolm pulled a small, ornate box from within his cloak. \\"Contained within this is a fragment of the original silence, captured and preserved. It is the antithesis to the quietude—an echo to fill the void.\\" Liam eyed the box warily. \\"And what must we do with it?\\" \\"We must place it at the heart of the source, let its resonance disrupt and dispel the quietude. It is the only way to reverse the spread.\\" The entrance to the library loomed before them, its grand double doors closed but not locked. The moment they stepped inside, Liam felt the silence grow denser, the air itself resisting their intrusion. Books that once whispered secrets from their shelves now stood as mute sentinels. The peaceful ambiance he cherished about the library had been replaced by a foreboding stillness that seemed to watch and follow their every step. The further they ventured, the cooler the air grew, until Liam could see his own breath cloud before him. A frigid core awaited them, a center to the silence that grew more potent with each foot they crossed. They finally reached the main reading room, where a vast void hovered in the air above a reading table. It was a hole in the world, a tear between existence and non-existence, and at its edges, reality frayed like worn fabric. \\"The source,\\" Malcolm breathed, the weariness evident in his posture. \\"Quickly, the relic!\\" Hands shaking, Liam received the box from Malcolm and approached the anomaly. The air thrummed with potential, with the absolute absence that hungered for his presence. As he prepared to open the box, a memory brushed against him—the warmth of human voices, the peal of laughter, and the rustling of pages—a symphony of life that this silence had devoured. With a swift motion, he opened the box and the fragment of captured silence—pure, resonant, and alive—unfurled into the void. A soundless shockwave pulsed outwards, a tremor that shook the foundations of the library and the fabric of reality itself. The void began to tremble, its edges undulating as if in pain, and then it started to shrink. The quietude was recoiling, retreating, as the relic did its work in silent defiance. Liam and Malcolm watched, holding their breath, as the darkness at the heart of the void receded. It dissolved into whispers of shadow that dissipated like mist in the morning sun, until there was nothing left but the air they breathed, newly imbued with a faint murmur of sound. As the quietude vanished, the taut silence snapped like a broken string, and the world exhaled in a rush of returning noise—the hum of electricity, the creak of the building settling, the distant call of birds once vanished now piercing through the air. People began to reappear, dazed and confused, emerging as if from a deep and dreamless sleep. Liam's heart leaped in his chest at the sight of life reborn, chaos in its most beautiful form. Malcolm placed a hand on his shoulder, a gesture of gratitude and kinship. \\"You've done it,\\" he said, his voice crisp and clear. As the restorative cacophony of life swelled around them, Liam realized that the silence had been a lesson—a reminder that sound and silence are two halves of the same melody. And he knew, deep within his once quiet heart, that the world would sing a little louder to him now, every whisper a hymn of existence that he would never again take for granted."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter","completion":"Chapter 6: Resonance Restored The wave of rebirth spread rapidly, reaching every corner of the town that had been engulfed by the unnatural stillness. With the quietude banished, the essence of life itself seemed to leap forth with renewed vigor. People stumbled out of their homes and workplaces, rubbing their eyes as if awaking from a profound slumber, meeting their neighbors' faces with looks of confusion and relief. Liam and Malcolm stood together in the epicenter, the library now alive with the murmur of voices and the movement of returning staff and patrons. The reverberations of the world made the marble floor beneath their feet thrum with energy—a symphony of footsteps and heartbeats. \\"You've saved us,\\" Malcolm said, his voice rough with emotion. \\"The Brotherhood owes you a debt we can never repay.\\" Liam shook his head, the librarian within him unwilling to accept such a heavy mantle of heroism. \\"We saved each other,\\" he countered, \\"and everyone else in the process. I just... I just wanted everything to go back to normal.\\" \\"A noble goal, though I suspect 'normal' has taken on a new meaning for you.\\" Malcolm's eyes twinkled with unspoken wisdom, a smile ghosting across his aged lips. The reality of their accomplishment began to dawn on Liam as he watched people reconnecting. He observed their gestures, the way they reached out to touch one another, to assure themselves that they were truly present. Sound and touch—gifts extraordinarily mundane yet inconceivably precious, reclaimed from the edge of annihilation. \\"Will it come back? The quietude?\\" Liam asked, the question tinged with a trace of fear. \\"No, at least not in the same way. The relic has mended the tear in the fabric of reality. It will hold. Our vigil, however, will not falter. We must ensure nothing like this ever happens again.\\" Malcolm's words bore the weight of obligation that Liam could now only begin to understand. Liam nodded, suddenly exhausted. The adrenaline that had fueled him, driven him to face the void, was ebbing away, leaving behind only the rawness of his ordeal. \\"There's still one thing I don't understand,\\" Liam said, his brow furrowed. \\"Why now? How could someone have known about the quietude, much less how to unleash it?\\" Malcolm's expression darkened, a cloud passing over his features. \\"There are some within the Brotherhood who sought power over duty, who believed that controlling the quietude could elevate them beyond mere guardianship. It is from our ranks that the betrayal likely arose. An internal menace is the most difficult to thwart.\\" Understanding threaded its way through Liam's mind, and with it, a renewed sense of vigilance took root. The world teemed with wonders and horrors alike, often intertwined in complicated knots. Silence was a wonder, a horror, a power that held both peace and potential destruction in its folds. \\"Will you take up a new vigil, Liam?\\" Malcolm's question was soft yet laden with significance. Liam scanned the library, its walls now echoing with the beautiful din of life. He felt an affinity for the quiet still, but also an appreciation for the clamor of existence. \\"I think,\\" Liam began, turning toward Malcolm, \\"that my vigil will be here, among the books and stories, reminding others of the power that rests in sound and silence.\\" A smile spread across Malcolm's face. \\"A fitting and noble choice, librarian.\\" The pair exchanged a firm handshake, a promise of shared secrets and mutual respect between them. As Malcolm left to rejoin the remnants of his Brotherhood, Liam stood alone in the heart of the library. Life buzzed around him, and as he walked back to his quarters, he felt the reverberations of each step, a testament to a world still spinning, still speaking, still resonating with the echoes of its close brush with oblivion. In the aftermath of the quietude's reign, sound took on a new resonance for Liam. Every rustle of paper, every hushed conversation, and every hearty laugh was a reminder of the battle fought against the silence. He moved through his days with a newfound purpose, cultivating the library as a haven for both the thunderous and the hushed moments of human experience. Liam would never forget the eerie quiet that had once stolen the world away, nor the lesson learned when he and an old guardian stood against the abyss. As the custodian of sounds and stories, he embraced the delicate balance between noise and peace, guarding it as fervently as the Brotherhood guarded their ancient secrets. And in the quiet moments, when the library's visitors had all gone and the doors were shut, Liam would feel the faintest hum of the relic's resonance—a whispering heartbeat beneath the foundation, a silent but ever-present defender against the void."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter and make it absolutely creeepy","completion":"Chapter 7: The Inaudible Pulse Weeks had passed since the day the silence fell, and Liam's life had returned to its steady rhythm. The library's patrons were none the wiser to the cataclysm they had narrowly escaped, lost in their personal worlds of study, work, and leisure. Liam, however, could not forget; his encounter with the quietude had changed him irrevocably. It was late one evening, as shadows lengthened into the early cloak of dusk, that Liam began to feel an unsettling sense of deja vu. The library was quiet, as it should be at such an hour, but this was a different silence—a charged expectancy that raised the hairs on the back of his neck. He tried to shrug it off as an echo of past trauma, but the feeling persisted. As he sorted through the returns, an odd vibration ran through his fingertips and up his arm, as if the book itself was humming with an imperceptible frequency. He furrowed his brow and placed the book on a cart, resolving to check it for any electrical or magnetic abnormalities later. The library closed, and Liam performed his end-of-day tasks with a growing trepidation that he couldn't explain. The darkness outside pressed against the windows, and the building creaked and groaned in a manner that felt like a precursor to a scream yet to come. After securing the building's doors, Liam found himself drawn back to the reading room—the site of their confrontation with the void. The lamps cast a warm glow over the tables and chairs, but as Liam approached the center of the room, the air turned cold. A shiver ran through him, a primal warning. It started as a low murmur, barely audible, like the whisper of clothing against skin. But as Liam strained to listen, it grew clearer, forming a wordless chant that seemed to emanate from beneath the library's floor. His pulse quickened, and against his better judgment, he moved closer. The floor beneath his feet felt solid, yet the haunting vibrations told another story. It was as though he was standing on the lid of an immense sarcophagus, and something ancient and grotesque was turning restlessly within. The books around him, once his haven, seemed suddenly ominous. Their shadows loomed tall and twisted on the walls as if they had contorted into spectral figures. Liam's breath quickened, and the room felt cavernous, too vast to be contained within the library's walls. Glancing over his shoulder, he caught sight of something that froze the very marrow in his bones—a silhouette in the stacks, motionless and watching. It could not be Malcolm or any other protector from the Brotherhood; this presence held a darkness that was palpable. The figure stood just outside the light's reach, its edges indistinct and shimmering like heat over asphalt. It was as if it had been woven from the shadow itself, and it seemed to pulse in time with the sinister hum that now filled the air. Liam wanted to call out, to demand an explanation, but his voice was locked within him, caged by an invisible force. The silence was not reticulated by reality this time, but by fear—a primal, clawing terror that threatened to pull him under. The shadow figure didn't move closer, but its presence was invasive, creeping into Liam's mind like a thick, black ink. He felt its gaze upon him, heavy and oppressive, and with it came knowledge—of ancient rites, long forbidden and sequestered away from the light of reason or sanity. In his mind's eye, visions flared: the Brotherhood, not just guardians, but captors of a force that was never meant to be restrained; an entity that existed between breaths, in the space where sound dies. It had bided its time, waiting for a crack in its prison to widen, for a chance to slip its chains. Liam could see it in the dark spaces behind his closed eyelids—a gaping maw, a darkness so absolute it was less an absence of light and more a devourer of it. He realized then that the quietude had been but an echo of this true silence, a shadow of a far more malevolent force. And now, it was waking, stretching its inky tendrils toward the thin veil of reality. The figure in the shadows began to move, not walking but gliding, its form fluctuating in and out of solidity. The hum grew louder, now punctuated by whispers of a language lost to time, a tongue that belonged to the entity. They were incantations, casting ripples upon reality, disrupting the laws that bound the world together. In the depths of his terror, Liam understood that the final battle with silence had not been fought and won—it had merely been postponed. And this, this was the beginning of an end beyond comprehension—should he fail to summon the light, the sound, the life force that could repel the darkness. He reached out, desperate to grasp anything that rooted him to the world of the living. His hand found the edge of a table, and with a herculean effort, he flipped it, sending books flying, their pages fluttering like the wings of startled doves. The sound broke the spell, if only momentarily. It pierced the cloak of silence that threatened to suffocate him. Liam ran, his only thought to escape the encroaching abyss behind him, to find light, to find people—to find anything that confirmed he was still alive in a world that hadn't been consumed by the unspeakable quiet. As he bolted for the doors, the entity's whispers grew into a cacophony of unholy sound—no longer quiet, but a storm of noise so intense it felt as if it would tear him apart from the inside out. He pushed through the doors into the night, the brief sanctuary of the library lost to him. Ahead lay the unknown; behind, the stirring of a primordial silence that had awoken with a thirst that could not be quenched by any means known to man or the universe. Liam didn't look back. His only hope lay ahead, in life and in the tremulous resonance of a world teetering on the edge of an eternal, all-consuming quiet."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter and make it absolutely disturbing","completion":"Chapter 8: The Devouring Dark Liam stumbled through the night, his breath ragged, his heart pounding out a frenetic rhythm of panic and dread. The comforting mosaic of stars was obscured by roiling clouds that seemed to swallow up the sky. A darkness was rising, one that sought not just to stifle light but to consume it. In the wake of the entity's awakening, the world had changed once more. This time the transformation was not silent but screamed with the cacophony of nightmares made manifest. The ground beneath his feet convulsed with each step, as if the earth itself was recoiling from the abomination that had been loosed. The streets that once held the joyful noise of life were now avenues of terror. Trees writhed as if in agony, their leaves withered to ash that fell like snow in the dead of night. The buildings, those inert, steadfast structures, seemed to contort—brick and mortar bending to unearthly will. People, no longer lethargic from a supernatural slumber, ran screaming into the void. Their faces, pale with moonlit terror, reflected a horror Liam couldn't bear to witness. They clawed at their eyes and ears, as if trying to rid themselves of the sensory assault—appearing as writhing silhouettes against a backdrop of malevolent darkness. A woman rushed past him, her mouth opened in a silent scream, clutching a bundled form that might have once been a child, now motionless and terrifying in its quietude. The woman's eyes caught Liam’s for a split second; they were hollow, as if her very soul had been clawed out by the claws of darkness. The atmosphere was pregnant with a distortion, a visual miasma that made the air thick and nauseatingly real. Buildings bent into grotesque angles; the sky bled shades of black and red, as though the very fabric of the cosmos was bleeding out into the night. And then the whispers began again. Not the subtle, inductive murmurs of before but a chorus of discordance—a symphony of voices, harsh and grating, speaking in tongues that twisted the mind. They came not from one source but echoed from everywhere and nowhere, a thousand voices scratching at the surface of sanity. Liam clamped his hands over his ears, attempting to block out the maddening cacophony, but the sound was not external—it resonated from within, vibrating through bone and sinew. In an instant of lucidity, he glimpsed the library behind him, no longer a place of refuge but a beacon for the creeping dusk. It was the epicenter of this chaos, a nexus point from which the entity had spilled forth into their realm. \\"An echo to fill the void...\\" Malcolm's words rang through his memory, a clue, a desperate chance. The relic, the fragment of captured silence—it had countered the quietude, but what if it could fight this new threat? What if the unmaking of sound could unmake the entity itself? Consumed by the need for action, Liam spun on his heels and hurtled back towards the library. The door, which he had left ajar in his escape, now stood wide open, black and uninviting, a maw ready to consume those who dared enter. A chill pierced him as he crossed the threshold, the inside of the library no longer the sanctuary of knowledge it had once been. The darkness within pulsated, alive with the intent to devour. Books, once neatly arranged, lay strewn across the floor, their pages ripped out, twisted, and inscribed with the same wicked symbols that now glowed faintly along the walls. Liam’s eyes searched frantically for Malcolm's relic—the small, ornate box that had quelled the quietude before. But the library had been transformed into a labyrinth of horror, reconfigured into an unnatural geometry that seemed to warp and shift with his every step. The whispers intensified, driving spikes of agony deep into his skull. Images flashed through his mind—flashes of other worlds, other realities, where darkness reigned supreme, where entities like the one he now faced roamed freely, feasting on the essence of existence. He stumbled upon the reading room, the nucleus of the nightmare. There, in the heart of the space, an abyssal rift clawed at the air, darker than anything he’d ever seen. It was an anti-light, a negation of being that drew everything towards its impossible depth. Liam approached, driven by the slimmest thread of hope. His hands groped along the shelves until his fingers met the cool familiarity of the relic’s carved exterior. With trembling hands, he brought it forth and prepared to unleash its contained echo one final time. But as he opened the box, what spilled out was not the healing resonance he expected. Instead, a blackness even deeper than the rift’s poured forth, accompanied by a guttural roar that absorbed all other sound. Liam watched in horror as the darkness from the box mingled with that of the rift, strengthening it, feeding it. The entity had deceived them, coiling its essence within the very object meant to be its prison. With a sick realization that twisted in his gut, Liam understood: there was no longer a relic to save them—there was only the void, and it had been waiting for him to set it free. In that moment of final dread, as the darkness surged forth to claim him, Liam's last thought was of the silence he once craved—the profound stillness of the library before it was tainted. He longed for it now, not as a guardian or a protector, but as a man yearning for a moment of peace before being consumed by the unending, voracious dark."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter and make it absolutely horrifying","completion":"Chapter 9: The Consummation of Silence Liam watched, paralyzed with terror, as the abyss unwound like a coil of night, stretching out across the room, reaching for him with tendrils of anti-existence. Every instinct screamed for him to run, to escape the all-encompassing black that threatened to swallow him whole. But there was nowhere to run. The library had become a dimensional trap, a place where space folded back on itself, leaving only endless corridors of encroaching doom. The horror that unfolded was beyond comprehension. The whispers converged into a single, sanity-shattering scream—a sound that seemed to tear at the very essence of his being, shredding his connection to the material world. The figures within the dark moved, writhing and twisting as they drew ever closer. They were a miasma of formless shapes, a horde of entities unbound by physical law, freed from the confines of their ancient prison. The air grew heavy, suffocating, as if the atmosphere itself was being drained of life. Liam's breaths became labored, each gasp a futile attempt to draw oxygen from a void. The library that had once been his sanctuary was now a mausoleum, its walls resonating with the echoes of otherworldly howls. As the darkness closed in, Liam caught sight of the books—the tomes of ancient knowledge, tales of lore, and myth. They convulsed violently, their pages flapping open as if possessed. Ink bled from the fibers, pooling on the floor and swirling into grotesque glyphs that pulsed with a malevolent light. It was then that Liam felt it—something writhing beneath his skin, a presence trying to claw its way out from within. A primal fear took hold, the fear of being unmade, not just killed but erased from the inside out. The once comforting solidity of his body began to waver, his limbs dissolving into the darkness as it claimed him piece by piece. The void was not just consuming his physical form but invading his mind, stripping away memories and thoughts. Liam clutched at his head, trying to hold onto his identity, his sense of self. But it was like trying to grasp water, his past and future bleeding away into the dark current. He looked up once more, and through the pain and despair, he saw them clearly for the first time—the eldritch abominations that lurked within the void. They were the antithesis of creation, their forms an affront to nature, an assembly of eyes and mouths that spoke of dimensions where madness reigned. One creature detached itself from the writhing mass, a being so horrifying that Liam's heart seemed to stop. It was a maw surrounded by countless eyes, each one staring into the core of his soul. The eyes pulsed, and with each beat, they seemed to pronounce an unholy judgment—an unspoken decree that Liam was to be unmade, torn from the world of existence. The thing moved towards him, and its gaze pulled at his essence. The ground beneath him had all but disappeared, replaced by the endless void that the library had become—a portal to an abyss where light and life were myths told by those who knew not the truth. As the creature's maw opened, a vortex of screams tumbled out, a cacophony of doomed voices that had been absorbed by the darkness—all those it had devoured over countless millennia. Liam's voice joined theirs as the realization of his fate crystallized in his shattered mind. The darkness was not a destroyer but a collector, amassing souls and memories to feed its infinite hunger. There would be no death for him, no peace in oblivion; he would become part of the eternal nightmare, conscious yet devoid of form, endlessly falling through the void. The last thing Liam experienced before being drawn into the unspeakable horror was a profound regret—a desire to have cherished the mundanity of life, the ordinary moments he'd so often overlooked. He realized at the end that the greatest horror was not the darkness or the void but the loss of the small, unremarkable beauties of existence that he would never experience again. Then, with a final surge of despair, he was consumed wholly, his essence becoming one with the entity—a note in the symphony of eternal darkness, a citizen of the realm of absolute and horrifying silence. The library sealed shut, leaving no trace of the abomination or the man who had dared to challenge it. Only the silence remained, a testament to the unspeakable horrors lurking just beyond the veil of reality."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter and make it absolutely shocking","completion":"Chapter 10: The Librarian's Legacy In a reality adjacent to the one Liam had known, the morning sun rose as it always did, casting its golden light across a small, peaceful town that had never known an unnatural silence. Birds chirped cheerfully, parents ushered their children to school, and the local library prepared to open its doors for another day of quiet study and literary exploration. Within this world, there was no knowledge of the nightmare that had unfolded in the unseen, parallel realm from which Liam had been erased. Life continued, untouched and blissfully ignorant of the darkness that loomed in the shadows of existence. As the librarian of this alternate place—a woman named Eliza—walked through the aisles, straightening books and readying the space for patrons, she noticed an anomaly among the stacks. There, on a table in the center of the reading room, sat a book that didn't belong. It was an old tome, bound in leather that looked weathered by centuries, and it was not part of the library's collection. Drawn by curiosity, Eliza approached the book, her fingers tracing the intricate symbols embossed on its cover. The language was unfamiliar, a series of glyphs and runes that seemed to shift and change the longer she gazed upon them. Oddly compelled, she opened the book to the first page. The words—if they could be called words—were written in the same enigmatic script, but as Eliza read, a voice seemed to echo in her mind, translating the text into a chilling narrative. It was the story of a man named Liam, a librarian from a parallel dimension who had faced an unspeakable darkness. The tale was so vivid, so heart-wrenchingly detailed, that Eliza could see it play out in her mind's eye. She read of Liam's valiant struggle against silence, the awakening of an ancient entity, and the eventual consumption of his world and his soul into an endless void. Despite herself, Eliza was mesmerized by the account, each page turn revealing more of the horror, drawing her deeper into the narrative. The descriptions of the eldritch creatures and the torturous fate of the souls trapped within the dark were so disturbing, so shockingly real, that she felt a growing sense of nausea and terror. As she neared the end of the book, her hands trembled uncontrollably. The final pages depicted the library—the same library in which she now stood—engulfed by the abyss, its walls crumbling into nothingness as reality itself was devoured. The last words on the final page were not written but seemed to be a direct plea from Liam, reaching across dimensions with a final act of desperation: \\"Remember me. Remember us. Do not let the darkness go unchallenged. You may be our last hope.\\" Eliza slammed the book shut, her breath coming in short, panicked bursts. She looked around the familiar confines of the library, half-expecting the shadows to start writhing with nameless horrors. But everything was as it should be—the light, the quiet, the absolute normality. The book—a relic of a fallen reality—sat innocently on the table, its mere presence a paradox that defied understanding. A warning or a testament, it had somehow found its way into Eliza's hands, and with it, the responsibility of a truth too horrifying to conceive. With a heavy heart and a mind fraught with disbelief, Eliza made a decision. She would hide the tome, protect it, ensuring that the story of Liam's world and its terrifying end would not be lost. Perhaps in preservation, there was a chance to prevent the same fate from befalling her own reality. As the doors of the library opened to the public and the day commenced, Eliza watched the patrons with a guarded, analytical gaze. She knew now that the line between the mundane and the monstrous was thinner than she had ever imagined, and that the horror of silence lay dormant, waiting just beyond the veil. The echo of Liam's plea resonated in her bones, a haunting reverberation that she could not shake—an obligation to carry the memory of a man who had fought the darkness to his last breath. It was a shocking legacy but an important one. Eliza would not let it be forgotten."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter","completion":"Chapter 11: The Veil Frays Eliza had locked the book away in the library’s private archive, nestled between aged and forgotten manifestos and mythologies. It felt akin to burying a cursed object, one that whispered to be discovered even as it screamed to be sealed away. Despite her efforts, the story of Liam and his lost world clung to Eliza like a second skin. She found herself scrutinizing every shadow, listening for whispers that shouldn't be there, expecting reality to shiver and show its true, monstrous form at any moment. Meanwhile, life outside the library marched on. The community remained blissfully unaware of the simmering terror that haunted their local librarian’s waking thoughts. Children laughed in the park, couples wandered down the streets hand-in-hand, and elders told stories of the good old days under the shade of sprawling oaks. The world was a symphony of normalcy and nascent springtime. Yet, something had begun to change, so minutely that only someone as attuned as Eliza would notice. It was in the irregular flutter of a bird's wings, the peculiar pattern of wilting flowers in Ms. Henderson's front yard, or the odd static that filtered through Mr. Callahan’s radio show every evening at precisely 6:13 pm. As the days blurred into weeks, anxiety clawed at Eliza’s insides. The feeling that something was watching from just beyond her range of perception became almost palpable. At night, the darkness of her own bedroom seemed deeper, a velvet curtain that threatened to suffocate her in her sleep. It was a slow Tuesday afternoon when her fears materialized. The clocks in the library stopped at 3:07 pm, their hands frozen as the silence descended like a physical entity, filtering through the spaces where laughter and chatter had once reigned. Patrons raised their heads from books and computers, a collective confusion knitting their brows. Then, as the silence deepened, a chill spread throughout the room. It was as though the library itself was drawing a long, anticipatory breath. Eliza’s heart sank; it was happening again. She could feel the fabric of reality thinning, fraying at the edges—the veil separating them from the abysmal darkness that had claimed Liam’s existence was tearing. She ran to the archive, her hands shaking as she retrieved the cursed book. Its leather cover felt colder than she remembered, and the glyphs seemed to dance under her touch with an eager malice. The pages fell open as if the book had been waiting for this moment, its pages filled with scenes that snaked into her mind’s eye—visions of crumbling cities and shrieking winds that carried souls into the mouths of waiting horrors. Eliza slammed the book shut, but the images clung to her retinas—a maelstrom of inky blackness that had already begun seeping into her world. She rushed to the reading room, the epicenter of the quiet that now enveloped the library. The patrons had stood and gathered together, instinctively seeking solace in numbers as the temperature continued to plummet, their breaths visible in the frigid air. Eliza looked around desperately, knowing somehow that she was the only one who could see the threat for what it was. That’s when she noticed it—the slight ripple in the air, the distortion that signaled the breach between their worlds. As she watched, a seam in reality appeared, a thin, jagged line that stretched across the far wall. Beyond it lay an abyss so complete that to gaze upon it was to feel one’s sanity peeling away, layer by layer. She could hear them then—the same scream-whispers that Liam had described. They were the death cries of a thousand worlds, echoing across the multiverse, an inexorable wave of entropy barreling toward her reality. The library patrons began to clutch at their heads, their own screams melding with the phantom sounds as they collapsed one by one. Eliza stood amongst the fallen, the only one left standing, the last sentinel against the encroaching void. A figure began to form in the breach—the entity from Liam’s tale, a mass of tentacles, eyes, and mouths. Its gaze fell upon Eliza, burrowing into her soul with an intensity that promised not death but something far worse—an eternity within the creature's darkness, her essence forever intertwined with the chaos of the entity. In that moment, the book in Eliza’s hands surged with power, its cover aglow with eldritch runes. The whispers crescendoed into a single, words-that-were-not-words command, a call to action that vibrated through her being. With a grim determination and the knowledge that she could well be sealing her own doom, Eliza stepped forward. She thrust the book into the breach, a desperate bid to reverse the opening, to mend the fraying edges of her world. A blinding light erupted from the point of contact between the tome and the rift, consuming the entity, the library, Eliza, and the fallen patrons in a radiance that defied the dark. And then, just as suddenly, it was all gone. The light receded, the breach sealed shut, and the world snapped back into place, as though nothing had transpired. Patrons stirred, dazed but whole, the disaster averted, the day salvaged from the brink of unspeakable horror. In the reading room, there was no sign of the librarian named Eliza or the malevolent book—their fates intertwined and erased from memory as if they had never existed at all. The library returned to its routine, and life continued its pace, as if a veil had not just frayed and been rewoven by the incomprehensible acts of a woman who had faced the abyss with unyielding courage and the echoing legacy of a librarian who had known too much."},{"prompt":"write the next chapter and wrap it up but leave it on an ominous note","completion":"Chapter 12: Silenced Echoes The library once again became a haven of tranquility and knowledge, its patrons none the wiser to the shadow of oblivion that had nearly claimed them. In the aftermath, a subtle shift went unnoticed—a quiet undertow beneath the mundane rhythm of daily life. Days turned into weeks, and the memory of Eliza faded like a dream upon waking. A new librarian, a man named Thomas, took up the post, his predecessor but a name in employment records, her disappearance attributed to an abrupt resignation or a personal leave abruptly taken. Thomas found himself drawn to the reading room, a place that seemed to hum with an energy of its own. He passed it off as the reverent ambiance that often accumulates in spaces dedicated to literature and contemplation. Yet, there were moments, fleeting and easy to dismiss, when he felt the weight of eyes upon him—watching, appraising, waiting. The library continued to serve the community, a vessel of narratives safely contained within the pages of books. Children came for story hour, sitting in rapt attention as Thomas read tales of adventure and magic, worlds both wondrous and strange. Adults browsed the stacks, searching for escapism or enlightenment between covers, unbeknownst to the thin veil that had mended just barely to keep reality intact. The evenings were the hardest for Thomas, when the patrons had left and the library's corridors grew silent. There was a thickness to the quiet that made it hard to breathe, a remnant, perhaps, of the silence that had once reigned—a precursor to the darkness that had brushed so close to their existence. Sometimes, as Thomas locked up for the night, he swore he could hear the softest whisper of pages turning on their own, a voiceless murmur that seemed to echo from the reading room. He would pause and listen, but then, reminding himself of the late hour and his weary imagination, he would shake off the feeling and leave the echoes to their own devices. One particular evening, as autumn settled in and the warmth of the day gave way to a chill that whispered of the approaching winter, Thomas found an anomaly—a book lying atop the returns cart, a book he could not recall seeing before. It was of modest size, bound in dark leather that absorbed the light around it, unmarked by title or author. Compelled by a mix of curiosity and an unsettling sense of duty to the library, Thomas opened the book. The pages were blank—empty—as if waiting to be filled. Yet, as he leafed through them, the unmistakable sensation of being watched returned, stronger now and carrying with it a pressure that tightened around his chest. \\"Curious,\\" he muttered to himself, placing the book into his satchel for further examination at home, convincing himself it was a journal misplaced by a patron. After all, the library was no place for superstition or fear. But the book did not belong in this world. It was a remnant, a piece left behind by forces that had shaped and sheared the fabric of reality. It pulsed with the potential of things unspoken, stories untold, and whispers unheard. As night fell, the library stood in silence, the heart of the small town where nothing extraordinary ever seemed to happen. Yet, within the shadows of the bookshelves, something stirred—a presence that held its breath, an anticipation for words yet to spill across the void. And there, in the darkened corners, an almost imperceptible rift lingered—fragile, temporary, sealed but not healed. It waited for the whispers to grow loud once more, for the darkness to find a new sentinel, for the silence to echo again. The story of Eliza and Liam had not ended but merely paused—a breath drawn in, held for the moment when the barrier would wane, and the pages of their legacy would turn once more. For in the quiet, between the beats of the world’s heart, the darkness waited, patient and eternal, its appetite never truly sated."},{"prompt":"give it a title","completion":"\\"Whispers Through the Veil: A Chronicle of Silence and Shadow\\""},{"prompt":"give it 10 more","completion":"1. \\"Silent Realms: Echoes of the Abyss\\" 2. \\"The Unspoken: Tales of the Quietude\\" 3. \\"Threshold of Shadows: The Librarian's Curse\\" 4. \\"The Silence Between Worlds\\" 5. \\"Echoes from the Void: A Library's Legacy\\" 6. \\"The Hushed Darkness: Whispers of the Unseen\\" 7. \\"Shattered Silence: The Binding of Realities\\" 8. \\"Eclipsed by Quiet: Elegy of Existence\\" 9. \\"The Soundless Depths: Chronicles of the Fractured Veil\\" 10. \\"Spectral Volumes: Guardians of the Hush\\""},{"prompt":"Which version is clear and more resonant : Elara’s fingers grazed the warm skin below Max’s wrist as she searched for his anchoring presence, and he interlocked his palm with hers as she bore into his knuckles. “I’m right here; you’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered in a low tone, resting his forehead against hers. “I can’t, Max, I can’t—” she panted, her face flushed, with a sheen of perspiration gleaming on her cheekbones as she gasped against his neck. As the intensity grew unbearable, her hand gravitated to the nape of his neck, her fingers intertwining with his hair in desperation. Grabbing thick strands between her knuckles, she formed a solid grip against his scalp, breathing deeply as her muscles spasmed with fury. In response, he placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen, applying counterpressure to the undercurve of her stomach, he urged, “You already are; she’s almost here. Keep pushing, Elara.” With every fibre of her being, she strained against his bracing hand, her breath filling the air; the room seemed to fall away as Max let his head follow her urgent pull. As she released the push, the child’s head crowning, Max locked eyes with her as she dropped her forehead against his. “Look at me, Elara; she’s almost here. You’re doing so well.” As her uterus clenched with brutal force, outlining their baby’s head, Max ran a steady palm over her navel, maintaining the pressure she craved. “Push, Elara, I’ve got you,” he reassured her as she wound her hand through his hair, and the intensity of the moment consumed them both. Just as another contraction swept through her, a voice pierced through her veil of agony, halting her preparation to push yet again: “Her heart rate is dropping—breathe, Elara. Don’t push,” a nurse instructed as Elara buried her head in the curve of Max’s shoulder, shaking with exhaustion. “Max—no—I need—” Max’s heart raced through his veins as he held his deep hazel stare on Elara’s uncertain blue gaze, maintaining his pressure against her trembling abdomen. “Just focus on me and only me. Now pant, Elara, she’s so close—” Her punctured gasps fell against his neck, and pulling his scalp downwards, her lips found his as he caught her agonized moan in his mouth. She kissed him frantically, then released a gasp as the urge to push consumed her, and she bore down, her fingernails tearing into his hair. “That’s it, Elara, her heart rate is coming up. Push her down. She’s in full crown; one deep push, Elara,” the nurse encouraged, and Max embraced her, his voice hoarse. “Look at me, Elara; we’re doing this. One more push and she’s here.” The atmosphere, shrinking inward as the anticipation and urgency mounted, drew closer like cling wrap as Elara’s primal effort reverberated through Max’s core, her hands guiding his mouth to her cheek, his lips falling against her heated skin. “That’s it, Elara…” he urged, with a sense of pride and awe, adrenaline coursing through his chest. As the baby’s head emerged and her body slid out with a rush of blood and amniotic fluid, the room fell silent, a cold sense of dread enveloping them both. “She’s not breathing—” a voice confirmed, seeming miles away as Elara fell against Max’s chest in terror, and he wrapped his arms around her. “Our baby, she’s—she’s not crying—Max—”. Time, almost standing arrested in handcuffs that bound Max in a moment of panic, stopped completely. As a nurse placed their daughter’s fragile, almost transparent body against Elara’s chest, she explained, “The skin-to-skin contact will encourage her to cry, her airways are clear, Elara. Hold your baby; she’ll breathe soon.” The next moment, as her baby’s blue lips broke her resolve, Elara turned away, crying into the hollow of Max’s sternum. Max gazed at his motionless child, willing her to respire, “Come on, baby girl, fill those lungs.” His own breathing, ragged and filled with his escalating fear, caused him to lower his gaze into Elara’s shoulder as the tension wrought through his chest. “Please cry,” he murmured, his plea merging with Elara’s exhausted tears. Then, as if on cue, a wail tore through the air, vibrant and healthy, and alive. Lifting his head, Max’s weathered eyes washed over with relief, and Elara gazed at her child with awestruck tenderness. “Thank God—” she laughed through her tears, placing a hand on the child’s back, rubbing soothing circles into her violet skin. Collapsing into Elara’s clavicle and smiling broadly, Max let a moment of unbridled joy overwhelm him, a few tears falling onto her skin. “You did it, Elara—I’m so proud of you both—” Elara kept both hands encapsulated around her now crying daughter, her lips again finding Max’s, as he delivered a rough kiss and then whispered, “What are we going to name her? We can’t call her ‘gorgeous’ forever.” Elara laughed in response, “You know the name we chose, but trust you to forget in all the madness—” Max retorted quickly as his smile only widened with wit and mischief, “I did not forget.

Этот процесс делится на несколько основных этапов: 1. **Сперматоцитогенез**: - Место: Семиниферные канальцы (тубулы), внутри которых находится герминативный эпителий. - Описание этапа: Этот процесс начинается с диплоидных сперматогоний (стем-клеток), которые делится митотически, образуя первичные сперматоциты. Первичные сперматоциты вступают в первую фазу мейоза (мейоз I). 2. **Мейоз**: - Место: Также в семиниферных канальцах. - Описание этапа: - Мейоз I: Первичные сперматоциты проходят мейоз I и делятся на два вторичных сперматоцита, которые являются гаплоидными (имеют половинный набор хромосом). - Мейоз II: Вторичные сперматоциты проходят мейоз II, делясь на сперматиды, которые также являются гаплоидными клетками. 3. **Спермиогенез** (или сперматоистогенез): - Место: В семиниферных канальцах в близости от базальной мембраны к просвету тубула. - Описание этапа: За этап спермиогенеза происходит трансформация гаплоидных сперматид в сперматозоиды. Во время этого процесса сперматиды теряют большую часть своего цитоплазматического содержимого, формируют хвост (для подвижности) и развивают акросому (пузырек, содержащий ферменты, необходимые для проникновения в яйцеклетку в процессе оплодотворения). 4. **Спермаций**: - Место: Семиниферные канальцы. - Описание этапа: Окончательное освобождение зрелых сперматозоидов в просвет семиниферных канальцев. 5. **Транспортировка и дозревание сперматозоидов**: - Место: После освобождения в просвет семиниферных канальцев сперматозоиды перемещаются в придаток яичка (эпидидимис), где они накапливаются и дозревают, приобретая способность к оплодотворению. - Описание этапа: Сперматозоиды проходят через отдельные секции придатка яичка (головка, тело, хвост), где они продолжают свой процесс созревания и приобретают подвижность. Сперматогенез начинается в период пубертата и продолжается в течение всей жизни мужчины, в результате образуя миллионы сперматозоидов каждый день. Примечание: Иногда все эти этапы объединяют в три широкие фазы: умножение (производство сперматогоний), созревание (мейоз для образования сперматид) и формирование (спермиогенез для превращения сперматид в сперматозоиды)."},{"prompt":"андроген связывающий белок функция","completion":"Андрогенсвязывающий белок (АСБ), также известный как секс-стероидсвязывающий белок (ССБ) или глобулин, связывающий половые стероиды (ГСПС), выполняет в организме критически важную функцию: он транспортирует андрогены в кровотоке. Вот ключевые функции андрогенсвязывающего белка (АСБ): 1. **Транспортировка**: АСБ переносит андрогены (такие как тестостерон и дигидротестостерон) в кровотоке. Поскольку андрогены гидрофобны, они не могут свободно перемещаться по крови, которая является водной средой. Связывая андрогены, АСБ облегчает их растворимость и позволяет транспортироваться к различным тканям и органам. 2. **Защита**: АСБ также защищает андрогены от преждевременного метаболизма и деактивации в кровотоке, что удлиняет время их полужизни и обеспечивает более стабильную концентрацию андрогенов в организме. 3. **Регуляция**: АСБ регулирует доступность свободных (активных) андрогенов. Только свободная фракция андрогенов биологически активна; андрогены, связанные с АСБ, не могут взаимодействовать с андрогенными рецепторами. Таким образом, белок контролирует количество гормонов, доступных для взаимодействия с целевыми клетками. 4. **Концентрирование**: В семенниках АСБ создает высокую концентрацию андрогенов, особенно тестостерона, что важно для нормального протекания сперматогенеза. АСБ вырабатывается в печени и в семенниках, где он способствует поддержанию высоких концентраций андрогенов, необходимых для процесса образования спермы. В организме человека АСБ взаимодействует также с другим глобулином — глобулином, связывающим половые стероиды (СГСП или SHBG), который также участвует в транспортировке стероидных гормонов."},{"prompt":"к кому принадлежит OpenAI","completion":"OpenAI — это исследовательская организация, занимающаяся искусственным интеллектом (ИИ), которая была основана в декабре 2015 года группой известных личностей в области технологий и ИИ, в том числе Илоном Маском и Сэмом Альтманом. Изначально OpenAI начинала как некоммерческая организация с целью продвигать и разрабатывать дружелюбный ИИ в интересах всего человечества. В 2019 году OpenAI переориентировалась на более традиционную корпоративную структуру, создав отдельную компанию OpenAI LP, за которой стоит организация OpenAI Inc. Этот шаг был выполнен для привлечения капитала посредством инвестиций и партнерств и для обеспечения масштабируемости операций, поскольку компания работает над такими амбициозными проектами, как создание искусственного общего интеллекта (AGI). OpenAI LP функционирует под руководством команды учредителей и руководителей. Сэм Альтман является председателем и одним из ключевых руководителей организации. Илон Маск покинул руководящий совет OpenAI в 2018 году, чтобы избежать возможных конфликтов интересов, поскольку его компания Tesla также работает над проектами в области искусственного интеллекта, но продолжает быть сторонником исследований в области безопасности ИИ.

Эти две части образуют единую функциональную структуру, обеспечивающую питание плода, газообмен, выведение отходов и барьерную функцию. Гистологические различия между этими частями связаны с их происхождением и специализированной функцией. 1. **Материнская часть плаценты**: - Происхождение: Материнская часть плаценты образована из эндометрия, а именно из его функционального слоя, который значительно модифицируется после оплодотворения и во время беременности и называется децидуальным слоем. - Ткани и структуры: Она содержит децидуальные клетки, материнские кровеносные сосуды и кровеносные пространства, известные как интервиллозные пространства, куда поступает материнская кровь. Эти пространства окружены децидуальной оболочкой и содержат богатую кровью среду, через которую осуществляется обмен веществами с плодной частью плаценты. - Гистологические характеристики: Материнская часть плаценты характеризуется наличием обильного соединительнотканного компонента и крупных кровеносных сосудов. 2. **Плодная часть плаценты**: - Происхождение: Плодная часть плаценты происходит от трофобластов, клеток внешнего слоя бластоцисты (раннего плодного яйца), которые позднее формируют хорион. - Ткани и структуры: Основными компонентами плодной части плаценты являются хориальные ворсины, которые врастают в интервиллозные пространства материнской части. Хориальные ворсины содержат сеть кровеносных сосудов плода, которые объединяются в пупочные артерии и вену. - Гистологические характеристики: Присутствие трофобластического слоя, который окружает ворсинки и состоит из двух основных типов клеток: синцитиотрофобласта (бесъядерного слоя наружу) и цитотрофобласта (слой мононуклеарных клеток под ним). Также здесь расположены капилляры и другие мелкие сосуды плода. Обмен веществами между материнской и плодной кровью происходит через плацентарный барьер, который состоит из синцитиального трофобласта, базальных мембран ворсинок и эндотелиальных клеток плодных капилляров. Кровь матери и плода не смешивается напрямую, обмен происходит по принципу диффузии через плацентарный барьер."},{"prompt":"чем отличается положительная и отрицательная селекция т лимфоцитов в тимусе у макрофагов","completion":"Вопрос, касающийся отличия положительной и отрицательной селекции Т-лимфоцитов в тимусе, немного неточен, так как процесс селекции (отбора) Т-лимфоцитов протекает не у макрофагов, а с участием тимических эпителиальных клеток и других структур тимуса. Макрофаги, конечно, играют роль в процессе уборки апоптотических клеток, но сам процесс селекции не происходит \\"у макрофагов\\". Вот краткое описание этих двух процессов: 1. **Положительная селекция** - происходит в корковом (кортикальном) слое тимуса и отвечает за проверку способности Т-лимфоцитов распознавать антигены с помощью T-клеточных рецепторов (ТКР) в контексте собственных молекул МHC (основные гистосовместимости комплекса). Т-лимфоциты, которые могут связываться с собственными молекулами MHC с небольшой аффинностью, «проходят» положительную селекцию и продолжают развиваться. Этот процесс нужен для обеспечения того, чтобы Т-клетки могли в будущем эффективно распознавать антигены на поверхности других клеток организма вместе с молекулами МHC. 2. **Отрицательная селекция** - проводится преимущественно в мозговом (медуллярном) слое тимуса и служит для удаления Т-лимфоцитов, которые слишком сильно реагируют на собственные антигены организма. Если Т-клетка с высокой аффинностью связывается с антигеном в комплексе с молекулами MHC, то она может быть уничтожена (через индукцию апоптоза) или стать регуляторной Т-клеткой. Этот процесс предотвращает развитие автоиммунных реакций, когда иммунитет начинает атаковать собственные клетки и ткани. Макрофаги участвуют в процессе отрицательной селекции, удаляя апоптотические (погибшие) Т-клетки. Они выполняют фагоцитоз останков клеток, тем самым поддерживая гомеостаз и чистоту тимуса. В процессе селекции, помимо тимических эпителиальных клеток, также участвуют дендритные клетки, которые также помогают представлять антигены Т-лимфоцитам в процессе их обучения."},{"prompt":"т-клетки проходят так и положительную и отрицательную селекцию, или конкретно только одну селекцию?","completion":"Т-лимфоциты в процессе своего развития в тимусе проходят как положительную, так и отрицательную селекции. Процесс развития Т-клеток в тимусе можно описать следующим образом: 1. Положительная селекция: Все развивающиеся Т-лимфоциты, также известные как тимоциты, первоначально проходят положительную селекцию в корковом (кортикальном) слое тимуса. В ходе этой селекции тимоциты тестируются на способность связываться с молекулами основного комплекса гистосовместимости (МHC) собственного организма. Если тимоциты не могут связаться со сложным комплексом молекулы МHC и пептида, они подвергаются апоптозу и удаляются, так как они будут неспособны к распознаванию антигенов в будущем. Те, что успешно прошли положительную селекцию, отправляются дальше на проверку, то есть на следующий этап - отрицательную селекцию. 2. Отрицательная селекция: Тимоциты, прошедшие положительную селекцию, затем подвергаются отрицательной селекции в медуллярном (мозговом) слое тимуса. Во время этого этапа тимоциты протестируются на свою реактивность по отношению к собственным антигенам. Если они связываются слишком сильно со собственными антигенами в контексте молекул МHC, они также направляются на апоптоз, чтобы предотвратить возможное развитие аутоиммунных реакций. Те Т-лимфоциты, которые проходят и этот этап, считаются \\"самотолерантными\\" и покидают тимус, чтобы выполнить свои функции в иммунной системе. Таким образом, каждый Т-лимфоцит, который достигает зрелости и вступает в периферийный пул иммунной системы, должен успешно пройти оба этапа селекции в тимусе."},{"prompt":"Составь 5 устных и 5 тестовых вопросов по теме \\"Ферментеры – биореакторы.

In the Layers panel, lower the Opacity to 40% (since 100% - 60% transparency = 40% opacity). 4. Save or export the image in a format that supports transparency, like PNG. **GIMP (Free Image Editing Software):** 1. Open the image in GIMP. 2. Click on the layer and select \\"Add Alpha Channel\\" if it's not already added. 3. Open the Layer Dialog and adjust the Opacity slider to 40%. 4. Export the image with transparency (as PNG). **Microsoft PowerPoint:** 1. Insert the image onto a slide. 2. Select the image and go to the \\"Format\\" tab in the PowerPoint ribbon. 3. Click on the \\"Transparency\\" option and choose one of the preset transparency options, or click \\"Picture Transparency Options...\\" for more detailed settings. 4. Adjust the transparency slider to 60%. **CSS (For Web Development):** In HTML/CSS, you can use the \`opacity\` property to make an image partially transparent: \`\`\`css img.transparent { opacity: 0.4; /* 40% opacity equals 60% transparency */ } \`\`\` And in your HTML: \`\`\`html <img src=\\"image.png\\" class=\\"transparent\\"> \`\`\` **Python (Using PIL or Pillow Library):** \`\`\`python from PIL import Image # Open an image img = Image.open('image.png') # Set the opacity (alpha channel) img.putalpha(int(255 * 0.4)) # 40% opaque or 60% transparent # Save the image img.save('image_transparent.png') \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`'image.png'\` with the file path of your image, and you might need to install the Pillow library if you haven't already using \`pip install Pillow\`.

For this problem, we'll assume a vapor-compression chiller system, which is the most common type. Such systems have four main components: the evaporator, the compressor, the condenser, and the expansion valve. Step 2: System Equations and Assumptions Next, develop the thermodynamic equations governing the chiller system based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Include assumptions simplifying the problem (e.g., steady-state operation, neglecting heat losses, assuming ideal behavior of components like pumps and compressors, etc.). The basic equations that will need to be used are: - Mass conservation equation for refrigerant and water. - Energy conservation equation (heat balance). - Refrigerant properties equations (e.g., using refrigerant tables or equations of state). - Calculation of the COP, which is basically the ratio of the cooling effect produced to the work input: COP = Qevap/Wcomp. Step 3: Define Operating Points Using the given values, define the operating points at the inlet and outlet of both the evaporator and the condenser. Calculate the mass flow rates of the water and the refrigerant considering the chiller's capacity. Step 4: Create the Model Model the thermodynamic cycle, typically using software like Engineering Equation Solver (EES), REFPROP, or MATLAB, to solve the nonlinear system of equations. Step 5: Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization To understand the impact of evaporator pressure, you’ll need to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the system's COP against changes in the evaporator pressure. Evaporator pressure can be linked to the evaporator temperature (superheat temperature), and it affects the evaporator area required for heat exchange. Vary the superheat temperature from 0 to 2°C and analyze how it affects the refrigerant properties and, consequently, the COP. Also, calculate the required evaporator area for these variations using the heat transfer equations for the given rate of heat removal. Step 6: Equipment Selection and Sizing Based on the COP values obtained and the optimized superheat temperature, select the appropriate equipment. Sizing involves determining the appropriate compressor power, heat exchanger surface area, and flow rates that satisfy the design conditions. Refer to manufacturers' data sheets for selecting components like compressors, evaporators, and condensers that fit the calculated requirements. Step 7: Literature for Selection and Design Procedure For understanding the design and selection process of chilling systems in a detailed formal way: - Research and identify technical literature, textbooks, design manuals, and standards specific to chiller systems. - Learn about different types of chillers (centrifugal, screw, absorption etc.) and when to use each type. - Understand the economic and environmental aspects of chiller systems, including lifecycle cost analysis and refrigerant choice impacts. Remember that a well-documented design procedure will often include thermodynamic analysis, component selection, system simulation, optimization, economic evaluation, and environmental impact assessment. Please note that this is a simplified guideline intended to provide a conceptual framework for your chiller system model's development. Each step can have significant complexity and may require a detailed engineering process to be carried out accurately."},{"prompt":"Based on the input parameters I have provided create a test case for me","completion":"Certainly! Below is a detailed test case for a chiller system based on the provided input parameters. # Test Case: Chiller System Steady State Modelling Objective: Create a steady-state model of a 200 kW chiller system and conduct a sensitivity analysis on the impact of evaporator superheat temperature on the Coefficient of Performance (COP) and the required evaporator area. Inputs: - Chiller Capacity: 200 kW - Chilled Water Inlet Temperature (T_chw_in): 12°C - Chilled Water Outlet Temperature (T_chw_out): 7°C - Evaporator Superheat Temperature (SH): Varied between 0°C, 1°C, and 2°C for sensitivity analysis - Cooling Water Inlet Temperature (T_cw_in): 24°C - Cooling Water Outlet Temperature (T_cw_out): 28°C Equipment Specifications: - To be determined based on optimization analysis Test Procedure: 1. Initial Setup: - Set the design point conditions as noted above. - Choose a standard refrigerant (for argument's sake, R-134a) and note its properties at the evaporator and condenser conditions through a refrigerant properties database. 2. Mass Flow Rate Calculations: - Calculate the mass flow rate of the chilled water to achieve the desired chiller capacity using the specific heat capacity of water and the temperature delta. - Perform similar calculations for the cooling water circuit. 3. Refrigerant Cycle Calculations: - Using the basic refrigerant cycle equations, calculate the refrigerant's pressure and temperature at the different points in the system (i.e., at the evaporator inlet/outlet, condenser inlet/outlet, compressor inlet/outlet). 4. Sensitivity Analysis: - Vary the evaporator superheat (SH) from 0°C to 2°C and calculate the COP for each case. - Calculate the heat load on the evaporator and the resulting refrigerant mass flow rate for different superheat values. - Using the log mean temperature difference (LMTD) method and an assumed overall heat transfer coefficient, calculate the required evaporator heat transfer area for each case. 5. Optimize Equipment Selection: - Based on the sensitivity analysis, identify the superheat temperature that yields the best performance regarding COP and required heat transfer area. - Select a compressor that can handle the calculated refrigerant mass flow rate and the required lift (difference between condensing pressure and evaporating pressure). - Size the evaporator and condenser based on the required heat transfer areas calculated in the previous step. 6. Model Validation: - Compare the model outputs (COP and evaporator area) with manufacturer data or empirical correlations for similar systems to validate the model accuracy. 7. Documentation: - Document the test case scenario, assumptions made, equations used, and the results obtained for sensitivity analysis. - Include recommendations for equipment selection and comments on the system's expected performance. Expected Outcomes: - A set of results showing COP for superheat temperatures of 0°C, 1°C, and 2°C. - A correlation showing the effect of evaporator superheat on COP and required evaporator area. - Optimized sizing and selection for the compressor, evaporator, and condenser. Notes: - The real equipment performance can vary due to factors such as part-load operation, non-ideal behavior, and unaccounted losses. - Detailed economic and environmental impact analysis should be performed to ensure the selection of the most sustainable and cost-effective solution. - Other system components such as the expansion valve, piping, and controls should be considered for a comprehensive system design."},{"prompt":"Please give me full solution for this I'm unable to grasp","completion":"Creating a full solution for a chiller system involves various disciplines, such as refrigeration, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer.

Solve for \`m_dot_chilled\` to find the mass flow rate of the chilled water. 3. **Select a Working Refrigerant**: For this case, let's assume R-134a as the refrigerant. 4. **Refrigeration Cycle Analysis**: With the standard assumptions, estimate the evaporator and condenser pressures using saturation temperatures corresponding to the inlet water temperatures. 5. **Evaporator Design**: Considering various superheat values (0°C to 2°C), calculate the changes in the evaporation temperature and thus the saturation pressure for R-134a. 6. **Coefficient of Performance (COP) Calculation**: The COP for each superheat value can be estimated using: ( COP = frac{Q}{W_{comp}} ) where \`W_comp\` is the work required by the compressor Work done by the compressor can be approximated using: ( W_{comp} = m_dot_{ref} cdot (h_2 - h_1) ) Here, ( m_dot_{ref} ) is the mass flow rate of the refrigerant, and ( h_1 ) and ( h_2 ) are the specific enthalpies of the refrigerant at the inlet and outlet of the compressor, respectively. 7. **Evaporator Area Calculation**: The heat transfer surface area ( A_{evap} ) can be derived from the heat transfer equation: ( Q = U cdot A_{evap} cdot ΔT_{lm} ) where - \`U\` is the overall heat transfer coefficient (can be assumed or taken from the literature), - ( ΔT_{lm} ) is the log-mean temperature difference between the refrigerant and the chilled water. 8. **Simulation**: Use a process simulation tool such as EES, MATLAB, or a dedicated refrigeration cycle simulation program to create a model and perform the sensitivity analysis: - Vary the evaporator superheat between 0°C and 2°C. - Calculate COP and evaporator area for each scenario. - Record how the COP and evaporator area change with the superheat temperature. 9. **Optimization**: Based on the simulated data, identify the setup parameters that yield the best performance considering both high COP and minimum required evaporator area. 10. **Component Selection**: With the optimized parameters, select the actual components based on the manufacturers' catalogues: - Choose a compressor that can handle the required refrigerant flow and lift. - Determine the evaporator and condenser sizes that meet the calculated heat transfer areas. 11. **Reporting**: Compile a report presenting your findings, including graphs showing the change in COP and evaporator area with varying superheat, and provide recommendations for component selection. Unfortunately, I cannot model this in a real environment or create simulations for you to see. Creating such models and conducting simulations require dedicated software and the background in corresponding technical areas. However, with this framework, you have a path to follow to develop your chiller system model and conduct the required sensitivity studies and optimizations."},{"prompt":"Please give me full solution, the refrigerant which I'm using is carbon dioxide and the software which I'll be using is Aspen hysys","completion":"Providing a full end-to-end solution for designing a chiller system using CO2 as a refrigerant and Aspen HYSYS as the software tool would require an interactive and iterative process which is beyond the capabilities of this text-based guidance. However, I can guide you step-by-step through the procedure you would typically follow. You can then carry out these steps in Aspen HYSYS. **Step 1: Define the Chiller Process in HYSYS** 1. Open Aspen HYSYS and create a new simulation case. 2. Set the fluid package or property method to an appropriate one for CO2, which is a common refrigerant. Aspen HYSYS' built-in property packages such as Peng-Robinson should work fine for this application. **Step 2: Input Stream Data** 1. Create input streams for the cooling water and the chilled water. Specify temperatures and flow rates based on the chiller capacity and the temperature values you have: - Cooling water inlet at 24°C and outlet at 28°C. - Chilled water inlet at 12°C with an outlet to be cooled to 7°C. **Step 3: Simulate the Chiller Components** 1. To simulate the evaporator and condenser, use heat exchangers within HYSYS. For the evaporator, you will set the outlet temperature of the CO2 to achieve a superheat of 0°C initially (12°C evaporating temperature as you stated). For sensitivity analysis, you'll adjust this to 1°C and 2°C later. 2. Include a compressor to compress the CO2. You will need to adjust the outlet pressure and use the power consumption as optimization variables to maximize the COP. 3. You'll need an expansion valve after the condenser where the pressure of CO2 drops back down. This is usually simulated with a simple valve in HYSYS through which the refrigerant expands and cools. **Step 4: Set Up the Refrigeration Cycle** 1. Create a refrigeration cycle that connects the evaporator, compressor, condenser, and expansion valve. The cycle should reflect the cooling capacity you want to achieve. 2. You may need to adjust the mass flow rate of CO2 to match the necessary refrigeration effect. **Step 5: Conduct Sensitivity Analysis** 1. Use the sensitivity analysis tool in HYSYS to see how the system performs under different superheat temperatures for the CO2 in the evaporator. 2. Analyze how your changes affect the evaporator size (based on required heat transfer area), COP (use the report and analysis tools to calculate), and power consumption by the compressor. **Step 6: Optimization and Equipment Sizing** 1. With the results from the sensitivity analysis, determine the best operating conditions (superheat temperature, COP, evaporator size). 2. Based on those conditions, you will then size your compressor and heat exchangers accordingly, selecting the necessary equipment capacity and characteristics. **Step 7: Validation and Reporting** 1. Cross-check the simulation results with literature data on CO2 chillers to validate your simulation model. 2. Use the HYSYS case study tool to automatically generate reports that compile your findings and optimizations. **Step 8: Iterate for Improved Results** 1. Iteratively adjust the conditions based on your first simulation results to fine-tune the performance of the chiller system. 2. Repeat sensitivity analysis and optimization as required for achieving the best performance while considering practical aspects like equipment availability and costs. Remember, HYSYS is a complex tool, and setting up a refrigeration system with it requires both a understanding of the software and of refrigeration cycle principles. Please use this as a procedural guideline to work through your case in Aspen HYSYS. However, actual implementation in the software will require your action and judgment in interpreting the results and adjusting the simulation accordingly."},{"prompt":"Where do I have to provide chiller capacity, is it in the evaporator","completion":"In a chiller system, the chiller capacity typically refers to the amount of heat the chiller can remove from the chilled water circulation system and is quantified in units of power (e.g., kW). In Aspen HYSYS, to model the chiller based on its capacity, you essentially set up conditions such that the amount of heat extracted by the evaporator from the chilled water stream matches the specified chiller capacity. Here's how to do this: 1. **Evaporator Setup** - In the Aspen HYSYS model, the *evaporator* is where the chiller's capacity is effectively specified because this is where the refrigerant absorbs heat from the chilled water. - You define the evaporator by specifying a heat exchanger where the chilled water enters at the warmer temperature (12°C) and leaves at the required cooler temperature (7°C). - The model should calculate the amount of energy removed from the chilled water which should match the chiller's capacity, given the flow rate and specific heat capacity of water. 2. **Heat Load Calculation** - To guide the simulation, you may need to calculate the heat load removed from the chilled water externally using the following equation: ( Q = m_{chw} cdot C_p cdot (T_{chw_{in}} - T_{chw_{out}}) ) Here, - \`Q\` is the heat load (chiller capacity), - \`m_{chw}\` is the mass flow rate of chilled water, - \`C_p\` is the specific heat capacity of water (around 4.18 kJ/kg°C), - \`T_{chw_{in}}\` is the chilled water inlet temperature (12°C), - \`T_{chw_{out}}\` is the chilled water outlet temperature (7°C). 3. **Using the Heat Load in HYSYS** - In the heat exchanger setup within HYSYS, you can input the calculated heat load as the duty of the evaporator. HYSYS should use this information along with the provided temperatures to calculate the correct flow rate and properties of the refrigerant. 4. **Sensitivity Analysis** - The sensitivity analysis or adjustment is typically conducted on the evaporator superheat temperature and the cooling water temperatures to achieve the desired heat load. This may involve iteratively modifying process conditions, such as flow rates or temperatures, until the heat exchanger's duty matches the chiller capacity. Remember that Aspen HYSYS uses rigorous energy balances and thermodynamic models to simulate the process. You'll need to monitor the simulation to ensure convergence and verify that the heat transfer duty of the evaporator matches the specified chiller capacity (200 kW in your case), which may involve adjusting some parameters or assumptions within the simulation."},{"prompt":"So how much is the flowrate then","completion":"To calculate the flow rate of chilled water needed to achieve a certain chiller capacity, you can use the heat capacity equation provided earlier: [ Q = m_{chw} cdot C_p cdot (T_{chw_{in}} - T_{chw_{out}}) ] Where: - \`Q\` is the heat load or chiller capacity (200 kW or 200,000 W), - \`m_{chw}\` is the mass flow rate of chilled water (kg/s), - \`C_p\` is the specific heat capacity of water (approximately 4.18 kJ/kg°C or 4180 J/kg°C), - \`T_{chw_{in}}\` is the chilled water inlet temperature (12°C), - \`T_{chw_{out}}\` is the chilled water outlet temperature (7°C). You can rearrange this equation to solve for the mass flow rate of the chilled water \`m_{chw}\`: [ m_{chw} = frac{Q}{C_p cdot (T_{chw_{in}} - T_{chw_{out}})} ] Substituting the known values: [ m_{chw} = frac{200,000 W}{4180 J/kg°C cdot (12°C - 7°C)} ] Doing the math: [ m_{chw} = frac{200,000 W}{4180 J/kg°C cdot 5°C} ] [ m_{chw} = frac{200,000}{20900} ] [ m_{chw} = 9.569 kg/s ] So the flow rate of the chilled water that the chiller needs to handle to achieve a cooling capacity of 200 kW, given a 5°C temperature drop, is approximately 9.57 kg/s. This is a theoretical value, and real-world conditions, like added resistance in the system, may require adjustments to this flow rate. In the context of Aspen HYSYS, you'd enter this flow rate for the chilled water stream going into the evaporator to simulate the heat removal corresponding to the chiller capacity."},{"prompt":"Now that I have got the flowrate I should feed it as the input parameter in the evaporator right","completion":"Yes, that’s correct. In Aspen HYSYS, you should use the calculated chilled water mass flow rate as an input parameter for the \\"cold\\" side of the evaporator. Here's how to proceed in the software: **Aspen HYSYS Steps:** 1. **Define the Chilled Water Stream:** - Create a new material stream to represent the chilled water entering the evaporator. - Enter the calculated mass flow rate (approximately 9.57 kg/s). 2. **Input Temperature and Pressure:** - Specify the inlet temperature of the chilled water stream (12°C). - You may also need to specify a pressure for the chilled water, though it's usually not critical for the heat duty calculation unless there are significant pressure drops. 3. **Evaporator Specification:** - Identify the heat exchanger unit in the HYSYS workspace, which will serve as your evaporator. - Connect the defined chilled water stream to the appropriate inlet in the heat exchanger. - Set up the other side of the heat exchanger for the refrigeration cycle, where the CO2 (or other refrigerants) absorbs the heat. 4. **Heat Duty of the Evaporator:** - To achieve the required cooling capacity, you will specify the heat duty of the evaporator based on your chiller capacity (200 kW). - In the heat exchanger design operation parameters, input the duty or use the temperature approach method, setting the outlet temperature of the chilled water to 7°C. 5. **Run Simulation:** - Once all the input data is defined, run the simulation and let HYSYS calculate the performance of the chiller and refrigeration cycle accordingly. - Verify that the condensing temperature and pressure, superheating degree, and subcooling degree, if applied, are adequate for the CO2 refrigeration cycle. - If necessary, iterate and adjust your model for the chiller system to converge. 6. **Result Analysis:** - Analyze the behavior of the chiller system by checking the temperature profiles in the heat exchanger and the refrigerant properties at the different points in the cycle. - Confirm that the evaporator is absorbing the specified heat duty. 7. **Further Steps:** - Depending on the level of detail and accuracy you require, you may also need to enter and adjust additional variables like pressure drops, overall heat transfer coefficients, and the properties of the refrigerant depending on the superheat and subcooling levels. Remember that simulation tools require an understanding of both the software and the physical process to ensure accurate modeling. If the simulation doesn't converge or if the results seem off, you may need to review the assumptions, property methods, or further refine your inputs."},{"prompt":"what about the parameters for carbon dioxide stream then, how do I define it","completion":"For the carbon dioxide (CO2) refrigerant stream in your chiller simulation using Aspen HYSYS, you will need to define the thermodynamic states that the CO2 encounters in the refrigeration cycle. In a basic vapor-compression refrigeration cycle with CO2 as the refrigerant, these states are typically at the evaporator inlet, evaporator outlet, condenser inlet, and condenser outlet. Here are the steps to define the CO2 refrigerant stream in the Aspen HYSYS simulation: 1. **Select CO2 as the Refrigerant:** - In the 'Fluid Package' manager, ensure that you have selected a property package that accurately represents CO2 in the two-phase and supercritical regions, as CO2 has a critical temperature close to room temperature. A property package like Peng-Robinson or Soave-Redlich-Kwong could be suitable, but you should verify this based on the specific case and available data. 2. **Create CO2 Stream:** - Create a new material stream for CO2 at the evaporator outlet, which is where the CO2 has absorbed heat and is at its highest specific enthalpy before entering the compressor. - Define the CO2 inlet conditions to the evaporator based on the pressure and temperature at which the CO2 changes phase from liquid to vapor (saturated liquid conditions). This is typically slightly above the evaporator outlet temperature to account for heat exchange inefficiencies. 3. **Evaporator Outlet Superheating:** - For the evaporator outlet, the CO2 will have typically absorbed enough heat to not only change phase but also to become superheated by the specified superheat temperature. For your case, this value should be varied from 0°C to 2°C for sensitivity analysis, starting at the calculated saturation temperature corresponding to the evaporator's pressure. - The superheat temperature is typically specified as a temperature value rather than a specific enthalpy value. Aspen HYSYS will use this, along with the pressure, to solve for the corresponding enthalpy. 4. **Compressor Inlet Conditions:** - These are the evaporator outlet conditions that you have just defined for the superheated CO2 stream. 5. **Compressor Outlet Conditions:** - After the CO2 has passed through the compressor, it will need to be at a higher pressure. The outlet temperature can be estimated from isentropic compression, but typically the outlet condition is calculated from the compressor work input and efficiency, leading to an increased enthalpy. 6. **Condenser Inlet and Outlet Conditions:** - Define the CO2 conditions at the condenser inlet according to the compressor outlet state. - For the condenser outlet stream, you typically assume that the CO2 is fully condensed and may even be subcooled to some degree. This means it exits at a lower temperature below the condensation temperature at that pressure, which in turn requires specifying a temperature condition for the outlet stream. 7. **Expansion Valve Inlet and Outlet Conditions:** - After the condenser, the CO2 passes through an expansion valve, where the pressure drops and some flash evaporation occurs. Define the inlet conditions according to the condenser outlet, and set the outlet pressure to match the evaporator pressure. 8. **Complete the Cycle:** - Connect all these streams and their corresponding units (evaporator, compressor, condenser, expansion valve) within HYSYS to mimic the refrigeration cycle. 9. **Simulation and Convergence:** - Make sure to double-check all stream conditions for consistency, as incorrect states can cause the simulation to fail to converge. Run the simulation and iterate as necessary. Ultimately, the success of the model will depend on the convergence of the cycle in the simulation, which will rely on the accurate definition of each state point and components for CO2. Because CO2 operates in both the vapor and supercritical regions depending on the conditions, it may require careful attention to make sure the states in HYSYS are physically feasible and accurately depicted."},{"prompt":"Can you give a test case for co2 that can get converged with the input paramter I have provided","completion":"I'll provide a high-level outline for a test case using Aspen HYSYS. Keep in mind that HYSYS might require specific inputs based on the components and flowsheet configuration. This is a general guideline and tweaking of parameters might be necessary to ensure the simulation converges. # Test Case: CO2 Chiller System Steady State Model Objective: To simulate a CO2 vapor-compression refrigeration cycle with a capacity of 200 kW, matching the inlet and outlet temperature requirements for chilled and cooling water. System Parameters: - Chiller Capacity: 200 kW (Cooling Load) - Chilled Water Inlet Temperature: 12°C - Chilled Water Outlet Temperature: 7°C - Evaporator Superheat: Varied 0-2°C - Cooling Water Inlet Temperature: 24°C - Cooling Water Outlet Temperature: 28°C - Refrigerant: CO2 Test Procedure: 1. Open Aspen HYSYS and set up a new steady-state simulation with a CO2 refrigerant package, like Peng-Robinson or Soave-Redlich-Kwong. 2. Define two fluid streams for chilled water and cooling water using given inlet and outlet temperatures. 3. Calculate and set the chilled water flow rate using the cooling load provided (approx. 9.57 kg/s). **Chilled Water Flow Rate Calculation:** ( Q = m_{chw} cdot C_p cdot (T_{chw_{in}} - T_{chw_{out}}) ) where \`Q\` = 200 kW, ( C_p ) (specific heat) = 4.18 kJ/kg·K, ( T_{chw_{in}} ) = 12°C and ( T_{chw_{out}} ) = 7°C. Solve for ( m_{chw} ). 4. Set up the primary components for the refrigeration cycle: - Evaporator - Compressor - Condenser - Expansion valve 5. Connect the components to form a closed loop. 6. Define a stream representing the CO2 refrigerant, entering the evaporator as a saturated mixture. 7. Input the initial estimates for superheat degrees, condenser exit temperature (subcooling), and pressure drop across the components. 8. Start the simulation and adjust the pressure of condenser and evaporator to get the desired cooling water and chilled water temperatures respectively. 9. Vary the evaporator’s superheat setting from 0°C to 2°C and observe the changes in COP and calculate the required heat transfer area. 10. Based on the model results, optimize the system by selecting a compressor that can handle the required pressures, flow rate, and other parameters that align with the cycle's best performance. 11. Validate by observing the convergence of the simulation and comparing results against known performance benchmarks for CO2 systems. Expected Outcomes: - A converged simulation demonstrating refrigeration with a 200 kW capacity using CO2 as a refrigerant. - A set of COP values for the system under varying superheat conditions. - Required heat transfer areas for the evaporator at each superheat value. Notes: - The actual COP calculation will require you to extract values for the heat absorbed in the evaporator and the work done by the compressor. - The detailed design for heat transfer areas requires further information regarding the overall heat transfer coefficient, which can be determined from the literature or estimated based on similar systems. - Due to the transcritical properties of CO2, care must be taken to make sure the pressures and temperatures remain in physically feasible regions throughout the cycles. This test case is a starting point; however, for a real-world analysis, the model must be iteratively refined, incorporating specifics like pressure drops, non-ideal component behavior (e.g., compressor efficiency), and practical design constraints. Please use this as a conceptual guide to create and solve your steady-state chiller model in Aspen HYSYS."},{"prompt":"Input the initial estimates for superheat degrees, condenser exit temperature (subcooling), and pressure drop across the components. Can you provide me an example for this","completion":"Sure, I can provide initial estimates for these parameters, which you can input into your Aspen HYSYS simulation. Remember, these are estimated values and would likely need to be refined to better reflect your system's requirements and ensure convergence. # Example of Initial Estimate Parameters Superheat (SH) Degree: For the evaporator outlet, CO2 is typically superheated to prevent liquid entering the compressor. Initial estimates could be: - Superheat temperature (SH): **0°C to 2°C** above the saturation temperature of CO2 corresponding to the evaporator pressure. - Example: If the evaporator saturation temperature is **-5°C** at a certain pressure, you would set the superheat temperature range to **-5°C to -3°C** for the evaporator outlet stream. Condenser Exit Temperature (Subcooling): After the condenser, the CO2 is usually subcooled to ensure it remains a liquid before it enters the expansion valve. Initial subcooling estimates could be: - Subcooling degree: Approximately **5°C** below the saturation temperature at the condenser pressure. - Example: If the condenser saturation temperature is **10°C**, you would set the subcooling temperature to **5°C** for the condenser outlet stream. Pressure Drops: Initial pressure drop values are somewhat arbitrary and would depend on the size and configuration of the pipes and heat exchangers. Estimated starting values could be: - Evaporator pressure drop: **0.5 bar** (Can be adjusted according to the size of the evaporator and actual measurements if available.) - Condenser pressure drop: **0.5 bar** (Same as above, would depend on system specifics.) - Piping pressure drop: **0.2 bar** for all the piping interconnecting the components. # Estimation Example for CO2 Properties: This is a set of hypothetical values. For an actual system, these would need to be derived based on the CO2 thermodynamic properties specific to the design and operating conditions. 1. Evaporator - Evaporator saturation temperature (estimation, for the pressure corresponding to 7°C cooling water outlet): **-10°C**. - Evaporator superheat temperature range: **-10°C to -8°C** (for SH 0°C to 2°C). 2. Condenser - Cooling water inlet temperature: **24°C** - Expected condenser saturation temperature (assuming delta T of approximately 10°C above CW inlet temperature): **34°C**. - Subcooling degree: **5°C**. - Condenser outlet temperature: **29°C** (34°C saturation temperature - 5°C subcooling). These initial values are just to start the simulation; you will need to adjust them based on the performance maps of the actual chiller components or empirical formulas that fit CO2 refrigeration systems. When you start the simulation, observe the calculated COP, temperatures, and pressures. If they deviate too far from expected values, the initial guesses should be revised, and sensitivity analysis should be performed to find the optimal operating conditions. Additionally, real CO2 systems might operate in transcritical conditions, which adds an extra layer of complexity; thus, you should also ensure that your property method in Aspen HYSYS can handle transcritical calculations."},{"prompt":"what about the 200kw parameter where should i give it?","completion":"The 200 kW parameter refers to the chiller capacity, which is essentially the rate at which the chiller removes heat from the chilled water. In Aspen HYSYS, this parameter translates to the \\"Duty\\" of the evaporator in the refrigeration cycle. Here's where you should specify this parameter: 1. **Evaporator Specification**: When defining the heat exchanger that models the evaporator: - Set the \\"Process Duty\\" under the \\"Duty/Spec\\" tab of the heat exchanger (evaporator) to -200,000 W to represent the extraction of 200 kW of heat from the chilled water. The negative sign indicates heat removal from the process stream. - Ensure that the chilled water inlet temperature is set to 12°C and the outlet temperature to 7°C in the stream conditions. The heat exchanger should be configured such that the chilled water is cooled down by exactly 5°C, consistent with the given parameters. To set up the evaporator duty in Aspen HYSYS, follow these general steps: a. Open the Heat Exchanger design window. b. Input the inlet and outlet temperatures for the cooling water and chilled water, as provided. c. In the heat exchanger specifications, set the duty. This corresponds to the heat transfer rate. In your case, enter -200 kW (Aspen HYSYS uses watts in its SI unit system). d. After inputting these parameters, the software will calculate the necessary mass flow rates and other thermodynamic properties through the energy balance. 2. **Verification**: After simulating the cycle with the estimated superheat, subcooling, and pressure drops: - Verify that the duty of the evaporator in the simulation results indeed shows approximately -200 kW. This ensures that your chiller model will perform according to the designed chiller capacity. 3. **Adjustments**: If the evaporator duty doesn't match: - Adjust the refrigerant mass flow rate. - Modify the operating pressures in the evaporator or condenser. - Revise assumptions like heat transfer coefficients as necessary until the required duty is achieved. Note that careful consideration of the compressor work will also be necessary when establishing the chiller's coefficient of performance (COP). The COP is calculated as the ratio of the cooling capacity (200 kW) to the compressor work (input power), and for an accurate COP calculation, the precise work done by the compressor must be established in your model."},{"prompt":"Should I have to give it in the inlet stream of my refrigerant","completion":"No, the 200 kW parameter representing the chiller capacity is not directly given to the inlet stream of the refrigerant. Instead, this value is related to the heat transfer duty in the evaporator, where the refrigerant absorbs heat from the chilled water. Here’s how this relates to the refrigerant stream: 1. **Evaporator Duty**: - The evaporator duty should be set as 200 kW (or -200 kW, depending on sign conventions in the software being used). This represents the amount of heat that the evaporator is removing from the chilled water and transferring to the refrigerant. This value effectively determines the chiller's capacity and will dictate the size and rate of heat absorption by the refrigerant. 2. **Refrigerant Inlet Stream**: - The inlet stream properties for the refrigerant will primarily depend on the conditions at which the refrigerant enters the evaporator. You typically specify conditions like temperature (saturated temperature corresponding to inlet pressure), pressure (evaporator pressure), and quality (x=0 for saturated liquid at the inlet) when entering the evaporator. - The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is not set initially but is part of the simulation results. It is determined by the software based on the heat transfer duty of the evaporator and the thermophysical properties of the refrigerant. 3. **Simulation Process**: - After setting the evaporator duty in HYSYS, run the simulation. Aspen HYSYS will calculate the required mass flow rate of the refrigerant and the energy changes throughout the refrigeration cycle to match the imposed duty of extracting 200 kW from the chilled water. 4. **Mass Flow Rate**: - The mass flow rate of the refrigerant will be a result of the simulation based on the imposed heat duty, thermodynamic properties of CO2 (or other selected refrigerant), and the operating conditions of the refrigeration cycle (i.e., evaporator and condenser pressures, superheat, subcooling). 5. **Iteration**: - If the initial simulation does not converge or the heat duty does not match your target, you may need to adjust some of the input parameters of the simulation, like the pressures and temperatures, until you reach the desired evaporator duty and, thus, the specified chiller capacity. In summary, the chiller capacity of 200 kW defines how much heat the refrigerant must absorb in the evaporator. In HYSYS, you set this as the 'evaporator heat duty' rather than as a parameter in the refrigerant inlet stream. The refrigerant stream properties and flow rates are then determined by the software to ensure that the heat transfer requirement is met."},{"prompt":"Duty in the sense heat flow only right","completion":"Yes, exactly! In the context of a heat exchanger simulation in Aspen HYSYS (or any similar process simulation software), \\"duty\\" refers to the rate of heat transfer, also known as heat flow. It is the amount of heat being added or removed from a fluid (or set of fluids) as it passes through the heat exchanger. The duty (heat flow) is expressed in units of power, such as watts (W) in the International System of Units (SI), and reflects the energy transfer rate. Therefore, when you specify a duty of 200 kW for the chiller's evaporator in HYSYS, you are effectively saying that the evaporator is responsible for removing 200 kilowatts of thermal energy from the chilled water per unit time. In practice, the duty can be a positive or negative value: - **Positive Duty**: Indicates that heat is being added to the process stream. For example, in a heater where energy is being transferred to the fluid. - **Negative Duty**: Indicates that heat is being removed from the process stream. For instance, in an evaporator like the one in your chiller system where heat is extracted from the chilled water, thereby cooling it down. Remember, when setting up your chiller in HYSYS, you want to make sure you apply a negative duty to the evaporator to indicate that the system is removing heat from the chilled water stream."},{"prompt":"So that's what I'm asking their are four streams in my simulation, water inlet and outlet, refrigerant inlet and outlet so where specifically should I give it","completion":"In Aspen HYSYS, the duty should be assigned to the evaporator unit operation (often represented by a heat exchanger), not directly to the streams. However, the effect of the evaporator duty will be seen on the temperatures and enthalpies of the streams entering and leaving the evaporator. Here's specifically where you should apply the 200 kW parameter: 1. **Evaporator Unit Operation:** - In Aspen HYSYS, select or insert a heat exchanger unit operation that will model your evaporator. - Open the design or rating mode for this heat exchanger. - Specify the duty of the evaporator as -200 kW (negative to denote heat removal). - The duty essentially defines the amount of heat that the evaporator is transferring from the chilled water to the refrigerant. 2. **Streams:** - Chilled Water Inlet Stream: Specify parameters like inlet temperature (12°C), mass flow rate, and pressure. - Chilled Water Outlet Stream: The outlet temperature (7°C) will result from the duty specified in the evaporator; this may be observed as a result of the simulation rather than an input to the stream directly. - Refrigerant Inlet Stream: Specify conditions such as pressure and enthalpy corresponding to the saturated liquid condition at the desired evaporating temperature. - Refrigerant Outlet Stream: Define superheated vapor conditions based on the evaporator outlet requirements (evaporating temperature plus superheat degree, like 0°C to 2°C above saturating temperature). 3. **Heat Load and Stream Effects:** - While you input the duty into the heat exchanger (evaporator) only, the inlet and outlet streams will show effects conforming to this duty. - For example, after simulating, you should see that the chilled water outlet stream has been cooled down by 5°C (from 12°C to 7°C), corresponding to the removal of 200 kW. - Similarly, the refrigerant outlet stream should exhibit an increase in enthalpy reflecting the absorption of these 200 kW of heat. Always ensure that your simulation is balanced and converging correctly. After setting the duty, run the simulation and let HYSYS calculate how this duty impacts both the chilled water and refrigerant streams in terms of changes in temperatures, pressures, and flow rates. If the simulation doesn't match the expected capacity (200 kW), adjust your inputs appropriately and iterate until the correct performance is achieved."},{"prompt":"Still some parameters are missing it's still not converged","completion":"Achieving convergence in Aspen HYSYS, especially for complex systems like a CO2 refrigeration cycle, can be challenging. If your simulation is not converging after you have provided the 200 kW duty to the evaporator, you may need to consider and fine-tune additional parameters.

For CO2, a package like Peng-Robinson or GERG-2008 might be suitable. 2. **Operations Conditions**: - Verify that the temperatures, pressures, and flow rates you've set for each stream are within realistic and physically feasible ranges for CO2 refrigeration cycles. 3. **Compressor Specifications**: - Check the compressor specifications, including the outlet pressure, which will be above the critical pressure for CO2, and ensure that the energy added (work input) is set correctly. 4. **Evaporator and Condenser Pressures**: - Adjust the pressures in the evaporator and the condenser so that they correspond to the temperature of your inlet and outlet cooling water and chilled water streams. - For CO2, you might be dealing with a transcritical cycle, where the condenser operates above the critical temperature and pressure. Ensure these are correctly set in the simulation. 5. **Expansion Valve**: - The expansion valve is typically modeled as a pressure drop. Make sure that the conditions downstream of the valve are set correctly to match the lower pressure and corresponding saturation temperature at the inlet to the evaporator. 6. **Heat Transfer Coefficients**: - Input reasonable initial estimates for the overall heat transfer coefficient (U) in the heat exchangers if required and verify that the calculated area is physically reasonable. 7. **Stream Specifications**: - Double-check that all inlet streams are properly specified with phase (vapor or liquid), composition (if the refrigerant is a mixture), temperature, pressure, and flow rates. 8. **Boundary Conditions**: - Review any constraints or boundary conditions you might have applied. They should be consistent and not contradict each other. 9. **Recycles and Convergence**: - Refrigeration cycles often involve recycles. Ensure that appropriate convergence methods or initial guesses are used for recycle streams. 10. **Solver Settings**: - You may need to adjust solver settings, such as tolerances and iteration limits, to help with the convergence of the simulation. 11. **Pressure Drops**: - Check for any pressure drops through the heat exchangers, piping, and valves. Define appropriate values based on literature or empirical correlations. 12. **Thermodynamic Paths**: - Especially for supercritical refrigerants like CO2, make sure the simulated thermodynamic paths do not cross into infeasible regions. If you carefully go through these points and make necessary adjustments, you should be able to approach convergence. If the system still fails to converge, you can try simplifying the model to only essential components and then gradually reintroduce complexities, checking for convergence at each step. Aspen HYSYS also provides diagnostic tools that can help identify the sources of non-convergence, which can be very helpful for troubleshooting. If necessary, consult the Aspen HYSYS user's guide or technical support for additional specific troubleshooting advice."},{"prompt":"I'm not getting where to put this 200kw chiller capacity specifically, either it is in the chiller stream or in the refrigeration stream","completion":"To clarify, the 200 kW chiller capacity doesn't directly relate to a particular stream but rather to the heat exchange process that happens within the chiller, specifically in the evaporator. In process simulation software like Aspen HYSYS, this heat transfer is referred to as the \\"duty\\" of the evaporator. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to input this information in Aspen HYSYS: 1. **Start the Simulation Setup**: - Begin setting up your components, including the evaporator, which is often modeled as a heat exchanger in HYSYS. 2. **Evaporator (Heat Exchanger) Setup**: - Once you've added the heat exchanger to represent the evaporator, you need to define the duty of this heat exchanger. - Double-click on the heat exchanger (evaporator) to access its settings. - Look for an input field labeled \\"Duty\\" or a similar term, typically under a tab labeled \\"Parameters,\\" \\"Duty/Spec,\\" \\"Design,\\" or \\"Rating\\". - This is where you input the chiller's capacity by setting the heat exchanger's duty. 3. **Input the Duty**: - Enter the 200 kW value for the duty. In HYSYS, the convention is that heat absorbed by a cold stream (as it would be in your evaporator) is negative. Therefore, you should input -200 kW. This number tells HYSYS that your chiller's evaporator is removing 200 kW of heat from the chilled water flowing through it. 4. **Defining Streams**: - After setting the duty in the evaporator, define your cold stream (chilled water) to flow through the evaporator at your given conditions (inlet at 12°C and outlet at 7°C). - The hot stream will be the refrigerant (CO2). You'll need to define the inlet conditions to the evaporator based on your cycle design (e.g., saturated liquid CO2 at the inlet), and HYSYS will calculate what the outlet conditions need to be after absorbing the 200 kW. 5. **Linking Streams to the Evaporator**: - Link your defined chilled water and refrigerant streams to the inlet and outlet of the evaporator heat exchanger. - The software will account for the heat transfer between the refrigerant and chilled water streams based on the duty set. By inputting the duty as described above, you are effectively telling the software how much heat must be moved from the chilled water to the refrigerant stream. You're not entering this information into a single stream because the 200 kW of cooling capacity involves energy transfer between streams. The heat duty affects the temperatures and enthalpies of both the chilled water and refrigerant streams but is physically a part of the heat exchanger equipment settings in Aspen HYSYS. So to recap, the chiller capacity of 200 kW is set as the duty of the evaporator (modeled as a heat exchanger), not in any individual stream. Once your simulation has this duty specified as per the instructions provided, it can proceed to find a solution that matches all your input criteria while respecting the energy balance represented by that 200 kW duty. If you still have problems achieving convergence, revisit other system parameters like stream flows, pressures, and component specifications, or seek assistance from someone experienced with the software, as small details may significantly impact the results."},{"prompt":"Give a detailed review on superheat","completion":"Superheat in refrigeration and thermodynamic cycles is the term used to describe the state of a vapor that is at a higher temperature than the saturation temperature corresponding to its pressure. Essentially, superheat signifies the amount of heat that has been added to a vapor beyond its saturation point – the phase-change temperature. # Importance of Superheat: Superheat is a critical parameter in refrigeration cycles for several reasons: 1. **Prevents Liquid Compressor Entry**: - Ensures that only vapor enters the compressor. Liquids are generally incompressible and can cause significant damage to compressor blades or vanes. 2. **Improves Efficiency**: - Superheating ensures that the refrigeration cycle operates efficiently by maximizing the utilization of the evaporator's heat exchange surface. 3. **Controls and Regulation**: - It is used as a key control parameter to regulate the operation of the refrigeration cycle and optimize performance. # Measurement and Calculation: - Superheat is typically measured by taking the temperature of the refrigerant vapor as it leaves the evaporator and subtracting the saturation temperature (the boiling point of the refrigerant at a given pressure). - For example, if the saturation temperature is 0°C and the vapor temperature measured at the evaporator outlet is 5°C, the superheat is 5°C. # How Superheat Affects Refrigeration Systems: 1. **Increased Superheat**: - Increases the temperature differential between the evaporating refrigerant and the substance being cooled, which can improve heat transfer. - Results in higher end-of-compression temperatures, which can lead to higher energy consumption and greater wear on the compressor. 2. **Decreased Superheat**: - Means that there's less buffer against liquid returning to the compressor, which increases the risk of 'slugging' and potential damage to the compressor. - Can result in decreased efficiency, as the refrigerant is not fully utilized in the vaporization process, potentially leading to unevaporated liquid. # Design and Operating Considerations: - The amount of superheat is often designed into the system and is adjusted by the thermostatic expansion valve (TXV) or an electronic expansion valve (EEV). These valves regulate the flow of refrigerant into the evaporator to maintain the desired level of superheat. - Different refrigerants and system designs have different optimal superheat settings, which must be considered when operating or troubleshooting systems. # Challenges with Superheat: - Too much superheat can cause the refrigerant to absorb excess heat, leading to overheating and possible failure of the compressor. - Insufficient superheat can mean that some of the refrigerant will still be in liquid form when it reaches the compressor, also risking damage. # Superheat in CO2 Refrigeration Systems: - Given that CO2 systems often operate near or above the critical temperature (transcritical cycle), managing superheat is vital to ensure the systems’ reliability and to avoid the operational issues associated with both too much and too little superheat. - Because CO2 has a high operating pressure and its saturation temperature is close to room temperature, the superheat in CO2 systems requires careful control and precise measurement. In conducting sensitivity studies on superheat in a simulation like Aspen HYSYS, it's essential to examine how varying degrees of superheat can influence the overall coefficient of performance (COP) of the system, and to strike a balance that maintains energy efficiency while preventing compressor damage. The particular superheat setting utilized will depend on the specific requirements of the refrigeration cycle, the characteristics of the evaporator, and the type of expansion valve used."},{"prompt":"So in the parameters which I have provided what's the superheat","completion":"The superheat in your provided parameters is defined as the temperature difference between the chilled water outlet temperature and the temperature of the refrigerant vapor as it leaves the evaporator. The superheat ensures the refrigerant enters the compressor in a vapor state, preventing compressor damage from liquid ingestion. According to your stated parameters, you have an operating condition with an \\"Evaporator superheat temperature: 0-1-2°C.\\" This indicates you are considering a range of superheat temperatures from 0°C up to 2°C above the refrigerant's saturation temperature at the evaporator's pressure. For example, to understand how to use these parameters in the context of designing a refrigeration system with CO2, consider this superheat explanation with your figures: - Let's say the refrigerant (CO2) at the evaporator outlet has a saturation temperature that corresponds to the chilled water outlet temperature of 7°C. Then, based on your superheat temperature range, the refrigerant vapor actually leaves the evaporator at a temperature of: 7°C with 0°C superheat, 8°C with 1°C superheat, or 9°C with 2°C superheat. This range means that for sensitivity analysis in a simulation or practical system design, you would investigate the performance of the chiller system at these superheat levels. It includes analyzing how such variations in superheat affect the system's efficiency (COP) and the required evaporator area for effective heat transfer. Implementing this in a software model like Aspen HYSYS involves setting the superheat conditions at the outlet of the evaporator and observing how it influences other system variables and performance outcomes."},{"prompt":"But superheat is a condition above saturation temperature of refrigeration right, then should it not the difference between the saturation temperature of refrigerant and the actual outlet temperature of the evaporator","completion":"Yes, you are correct. Superheat refers to the condition where the refrigerant temperature is higher than its saturation temperature at a given pressure. It is the temperature difference above the boiling point of the refrigerant within the evaporator. In a refrigeration system, the refrigerant exits the evaporator as a vapor above its saturation temperature, which is superheated vapor. To clarify: - **Saturation Temperature**: The temperature at which the refrigerant changes phase from liquid to vapor (boils) at a given pressure. - **Superheat**: The temperature increase above the saturation temperature. In a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, the saturated vapor temperature corresponds to the boiling temperature at the evaporator pressure. So the superheated vapor temperature is the actual temperature of the refrigerant as it leaves the evaporator. For your parameters: - You provided an \\"Evaporator superheat temperature: 0-1-2°C,\\" implying that there is up to a 2-degree Celsius temperature increase above the saturation temperature. To determine the actual superheat in the system, you would do the following: 1. Determine the **saturation temperature** of the refrigerant (CO2) at the evaporator operating pressure. This value can be found by using pressure-enthalpy diagrams, thermodynamic tables, or refrigerant properties software specific to the refrigerant being used. 2. Measure the **actual temperature** of the vapor refrigerant as it exits the evaporator. 3. Calculate the superheat by subtracting the saturation temperature from the actual vapor temperature: [ text{Superheat} = text{Actual Vapor Temperature} - text{Saturation Temperature} ] In the absence of specific evaporator operating pressure data in your system, we cannot determine the exact saturation temperature of CO2. Thus, we cannot provide a precise superheat value. However, in your analysis or simulation, you would adjust the pressure conditions and provide or calculate the saturation temperature in order to set an evaporator outlet temperature 0 to 2 degrees Celsius higher than this saturation temperature, depending on the level of superheat you wish to analyze."},{"prompt":"Give an example in the form of test case","completion":"Below is an example of a test case scenario for a vapor-compression chiller system using CO2 as the refrigerant, including details on how to take superheat into account. # Test Case: CO2 Chiller System with Superheat Analysis Objective: Simulate a CO2 vapor-compression refrigeration cycle with a capacity of 200 kW to study the effect of evaporator superheat on system performance. System Parameters: - Chiller Capacity: 200 kW - Chilled Water Inlet Temperature: 12°C - Chilled Water Outlet Temperature: 7°C - Evaporator Superheat Temperature: Variable (from 0 to 2°C) - Cooling Water Inlet Temperature: 24°C - Cooling Water Outlet Temperature: 28°C - Refrigerant: Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Test Procedure Steps: 1. **Initial Setup**: - Begin a new simulation in Aspen HYSYS. - Choose a suitable fluid package that can accurately model CO2's properties, especially near its critical point. 2. **Define Streams**: - Create a chilled water stream (12°C in, 7°C out) and input the calculated flow rate based on the desired chiller capacity of 200 kW. - Create a cooling water stream (24°C in, 28°C out) with an assumed flow rate (to be adjusted as necessary). - Create a stream for CO2 entering the evaporator (ensure the stream is set to a mixed or saturated liquid state at the appropriate pressure). 3. **Component Setup**: - Insert a heat exchanger to simulate the evaporator. Specify the duty (-200 kW) so that heat is removed from the chilled water. - Insert a compressor with a pressure ratio or outlet pressure that aligns with the cycle's condensing temperature. - Insert a second heat exchanger to simulate the condenser, through which CO2 rejects heat to the cooling water. - Insert an expansion valve modeled as a throttle valve or pressure drop to achieve the reduction in pressure necessary for evaporation. 4. **Set Superheat Conditions for Sensitivity Analysis**: - Calculate the saturation temperature of CO2 at the evaporator pressure corresponding to the 7°C chilled water outlet temperature. - Set varying scenarios for the evaporator outlet superheat: a) 0°C, b) 1°C, c) 2°C above the saturation temperature. 5. **Run the Simulation and Adjust**: - Execute the simulation for each superheat scenario. Monitor convergence and make necessary adjustments, such as fine-tuning the pressure drops and compressor work. 6. **Sensitivity Analysis**: - Record the system performance variables, such as COP, evaporator and condenser load, and refrigerant mass flow rates for each superheat value. 7. **Comparison and Optimization**: - Compare the results of the sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal superheat level that maximizes efficiency while avoiding the risk of liquid refrigerant in the compressor (i.e., the best COP). - Optimize the size of the heat exchange surfaces in the evaporator and condenser based on the heat transfer coefficients and the required capacities. Desired Outcomes: 1. Convergence of simulation across all scenarios, indicating realistic behavior of the refrigeration cycle. 2. A dataset illustrating the relationship between superheat levels in the evaporator and the efficiency and performance of the chiller system. 3. Recommendations for the evaporator design and control settings to maintain optimal superheat. Notes: - The results of each simulation may require adjustments to the process variables to maintain physical accuracy and prevent transcritical operation (if undesired). - Final equipment sizing and selection must consider not only simulation results but also industry standards and manufacturing constraints. This example test case assumes access to a detailed database of CO2 properties and typical values for heat transfer coefficients and compressor efficiency. Achieving convergence in the simulation may require iterative adjustments, which is common in such process simulations. If specific values for parameters like pressure drops and heat transfer coefficients are not available, reasonable initial estimates should be made based on engineering judgment and available design data."},{"prompt":"So tell me what should be the outlet evaporator temperature for the refrigerant side","completion":"To determine the refrigerant outlet temperature from the evaporator (which includes superheat), we must consider the refrigerant's saturation temperature at the evaporator pressure. The refrigerant outlet temperature is the sum of the saturation temperature and the degree of superheat. Let's outline the steps to find the saturation temperature and calculate the appropriate superheat: 1. **Evaporator Pressure**: Determine the pressure inside the evaporator. This pressure corresponds to the saturation temperature of the refrigerant at the desired outlet temperature of the chilled water. If the chilled water outlet temperature is 7°C, look for the refrigerant (in your case, CO2) saturation temperature that matches this condition. 2. **Refrigerant Saturation Temperature**: Find the saturation temperature of CO2 at the evaporator pressure. You can use refrigerant tables, a pressure-enthalpy diagram, or software tools like Aspen HYSYS or REFPROP to get this temperature. 3. **Degree of Superheat**: Decide on how many degrees of superheat you want in your system—based on your specifications, it could be 0°C, 1°C, or 2°C above the saturation temperature. 4. **Calculate Evaporator Outlet Temperature for Refrigerant (Superheated Temperature)**: Add the degree of superheat to the saturation temperature to get the refrigerant outlet temperature. Example Calculation: Suppose the evaporator pressure corresponds to a saturation temperature of CO2 at -3°C (this is an assumed figure for the purpose of this example). For each degree of superheat specified (0°C, 1°C, or 2°C), the evaporator outlet temperatures for the refrigerant would be: - With 0°C Superheat: -3°C + 0°C = -3°C - With 1°C Superheat: -3°C + 1°C = -2°C - With 2°C Superheat: -3°C + 2°C = -1°C So, these are the temperatures that the CO2 would exhibit as it exits the evaporator based on the specified degrees of superheat in each case. To achieve this in an Aspen HYSYS simulation, you would have to adjust the operational settings of the evaporator so that the refrigerant vapor achieves these temperatures before it heads to the compressor. The actual superheat temperature used in a real system would be based on what's optimal for the system efficiency and compressor safety. It would typically be a value confirmed through a combination of design practices, manufacturer recommendations, and operational experience."},{"prompt":"So what it will be in my case","completion":"To determine the specific outlet evaporator temperature for the refrigerant side in your case, we need to first define the saturation temperature of CO2 at the evaporator conditions. However, since the provided parameters in your case do not include the evaporator pressure, we are not able to directly calculate the CO2 saturation temperature. The saturation temperature is the temperature at which CO2 at a given pressure transitions from liquid to vapor (or vice versa). For correct function, the evaporator needs to operate such that the outlet chilled water is at the desired temperature of 7°C, which implies the saturation temperature of CO2 inside the evaporator is slightly lower than this. In practice, the refrigerant saturation temperature can be looked up in refrigerant property tables or obtained from a property database (e.g., REFPROP or Aspen HYSYS) by inputting the evaporator pressure. Assuming we have the saturation temperature now, if we add the required superheat degree (0-1-2°C), we can calculate the outlet temperatures: Here's a hypothetical example: - Assume CO2 saturation temperature is approximately 6°C at a given pressure in the evaporator (as it must be slightly lower than the 7°C outlet temperature of the chilled water to allow for heat transfer). Then the superheated vapor temperatures would be: - With 0°C Superheat: 6°C + 0°C = 6°C - With 1°C Superheat: 6°C + 1°C = 7°C - With 2°C Superheat: 6°C + 2°C = 8°C So, under this hypothetical scenario, your CO2 would be leaving the evaporator at temperatures of 6°C, 7°C, or 8°C, corresponding to the superheat levels you're considering. As you run a simulation, you will set the outlet temperature of the CO2 from the evaporator to these levels to study the sensitivity of system performance to the degree of superheat. The actual saturation temperature will be determined based on the specific conditions of the chiller system you're designing, and you would vary the evaporator outlet temperature accordingly to apply the desired superheat."},{"prompt":"Give me a detailed procedure to determine saturation temperature of co2","completion":"Determining the saturation temperature of carbon dioxide (CO2) at a given pressure is a common task in refrigeration system design and analysis. The saturation temperature is the temperature at which CO2 can exist in both liquid and vapor states at a specific pressure. To find this temperature, you can use refrigerant tables, thermodynamic charts, or refrigerant property software. Here is a detailed procedure using each method: # Refrigerant Tables: Refrigerant tables are often provided in various HVAC and refrigeration handbooks such as \\"ASHRAE Fundamentals\\" and contain data on the physical properties of different refrigerants, including CO2. 1. Locate the pressure-temperature (PT) tables for CO2 in a reputable refrigeration handbook or source. 2. Find the section of the table that lists saturation temperatures corresponding to various pressures. 3. Look up the pressure of your CO2 refrigerant within the evaporator in the table. 4. Read across that row to find the associated saturation temperature for that pressure. # Thermodynamic Charts: A pressure-enthalpy (P-h) diagram for CO2 provides a visual tool for seeing saturation temperatures at corresponding pressures. 1. Obtain a P-h diagram for CO2 from a refrigeration textbook or online source. 2. Locate the saturation curve (often indicated as a bold or dashed line) on the diagram. 3. Find the point on the saturation curve that corresponds to your known system pressure. 4. Read horizontally to the temperature axis from your point on the saturation curve to determine the saturation temperature. # Refrigerant Property Software: Software like NIST REFPROP, CoolProp, or built-in functionality of simulation tools like Aspen HYSYS can compute fluid properties for CO2 accurately. 1. **REFPROP or CoolProp**: - Launch the software and enter accurate refrigerant data if necessary (for example, the pure component CO2). - Input the pressure of the CO2 in the evaporator. - The software will show the saturation temperature directly or allow you to query saturation properties. 2. **Aspen HYSYS**: - Open Aspen HYSYS and select or create a new simulation. - Define the fluid package that best models CO2 (such as Peng-Robinson). - Input a stream with the CO2 component and set it to the evaporator pressure. - Use the \\"Property View\\" tab to display properties for the stream. - Look for the \\"Saturation Temperature\\" property which the software calculates based on the specified pressure. # Example Procedure Using Software: For a comprehensive procedure using Aspen HYSYS (or similar software) to find the saturation temperature, follow these steps: 1. Open Aspen HYSYS, create a new case, and select a property package for CO2 — for CO2, this might be Peng-Robinson or Peng-Robinson EOS. 2. Open the \\"Fluid Package Manager\\" and verify the chosen fluid package, which should properly model the behavior of CO2, especially near its critical point. 3. Add a new material stream to your simulation workspace. 4. Define the composition of the stream, ensuring it's set to 100% CO2 if it's a pure refrigerant cycle. 5. Enter the known operating pressure of CO2 at the evaporator. 6. Open the stream's \\"Properties\\" tab and ensure it's set to evaluate properties at the saturation condition. This will often be a checkbox or dropdown menu where you must select a phase state, such as \\"saturated liquid\\" or \\"saturated vapor.\\" 7. Aspen HYSYS will calculate and display the saturation temperature for CO2 at the given pressure. By knowing the saturation temperature, you can design and control refrigeration processes effectively, ensuring efficient operation of the system while safeguarding components from damage. It's critical to maintain an accurate database of thermodynamic fluid properties for the refrigerant being used, especially with working fluids like CO2 which have critical points close to ambient temperatures and pressures."},{"prompt":"Can you calculate the saturation temperature of carbondioxide for me","completion":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not have access to real-time databases or the ability to directly perform calculations with external software tools such as NIST REFPROP, CoolProp, or Aspen HYSYS that would typically be used to precisely determine the saturation temperature of carbon dioxide (CO2) at a given pressure. However, I can guide you on how to calculate it manually if you have access to standard refrigeration tables or if you are using a thermodynamic properties tool/software. For instance, if you were using a software tool like REFPROP, you would: 1. Open the software and select CO2 as your fluid. 2. Input the evaporator pressure level. 3. Inquire about the saturation properties at this pressure. 4. The software would provide you with the saturation temperature corresponding to the input pressure. If you are using thermodynamic tables for CO2: 1. Locate the pressure-temperature saturation table for CO2. These are often found in the appendices of thermodynamic textbooks or engineering handbooks. 2. Look up the table entry that corresponds to your given pressure (likely in bar or psi units). 3. Read off the associated saturation temperature (likely in °C or °F units). Please provide a specific pressure value if you would like to see an example calculation with hypothetical data based on typical thermodynamic behavior.

Wielding a device resembling a pocket watch, The Traveller slides between eras, observing history, preempting disasters, and occasionally altering events for the greater good, all while trying to uncover the truth about her own enigmatic past and the origins of her time-travel abilities. Jenny Agutter stars as The Traveller in this classic series. The termed \\"The Fourth Traveller\\" suggests that there have been previous incarnations of the character, enhancing the enigma behind the role. The time period of Agutter's character's travels, from the early 1970s to the early 1980s, infuses the show with a rich tapestry of sociopolitical contexts against which various stories can be told. One serial, \\"The Time-Touched Track,\\" is particularly notable for its fusion of spectral folklore and time-travel intrigue. Set against the backdrop of an eerie, dilapidated railway station, the narrative weaves themes from Charles Dickens' \\"The Signalman,\\" the ghostly fiction of M.R. James, and darker urban legends of phantom trains. The Time-Touched Track (4 x 25 min episodes): Episode 1: \\"The Disused Platform\\" As The Traveller arrives at an abandoned railway station, she senses an anomaly in the fabric of time. She meets a terrified signalman who speaks of ghostly apparitions and trains that travel to nowhere. The Traveller decides to investigate and discovers a mural depicting various periods of history, with a peculiar tunnel that doesn't seem to conform to the station's architecture. Episode 2: \\"The Phantom Express\\" The Traveller spends the night at the station, and, as the station clock strikes midnight, hears the sound of a train approaching. Venturing into the tunnel, she encounters a spectral train that seems to exist in multiple time periods simultaneously. She boards the train, and it whisks her away to a series of historical events, each marking moments of great despair and tragedy. Episode 3: \\"The Weeping Passenger\\" One of the passengers, a ghostly figure trapped on the train, begs The Traveller for help in returning to her own time before she was taken by the train's mysterious power. The Traveller learns the train is drawn to the emotional energies of significant historical tragedies and must correct a disturbance caused by one such event that is anchoring the train in a time loop. Episode 4: \\"The Final Station\\" Working with the signalman, who turns out to be a fellow time-sensitive individual, The Traveller devises a plan to reroute the train and break the cycle. As they confront the entity controlling the train, The Traveller is forced to navigate the moral complexities of altering history, mustering courage to make a personal sacrifice that may finally release the lost souls on board and bring peace to the haunted track. Throughout this tense narrative, viewers will be drawn into a reflection on the human cost of historical events, the echo of collective traumas, and the eternal human struggle against the forces that seek to ensnare and confine the spirit. Jenny Agutter's portrayal of The Fourth Traveller, embodying both vulnerability and steely resolve, imbues each episode with emotive depth, making \\"The Time-Touched Track\\" a standout serial in the overall \\"The Traveller\\" series."},{"prompt":"\\"The Traveller\\" series is somewhat inspired by \\"Doctor Who\\", another serial for the Traveller, sees her TRADIS equivalent, land in Edwardian England, only for the Fourth Traveller, to becomeinadvertently involved in a gothic conspiracy, concerning ancient artefacts and the alien presence they summoned! 4x25 min episode serial, Possible Influences : HammerHorror films , Ancient Alien theories, H.G. Wells","completion":"Serial Title: \\"The Gilded Shadows\\" Serial Overview: In \\"The Gilded Shadows,\\" The Fourth Traveller, played by Jenny Agutter, finds herself drawn into a sinister plot hidden beneath the surface of polished Edwardian society. The Fourth Traveller's TARDIS-equivalent, perhaps called the \\"Chrono-Capsule,\\" materializes in a world where gaslights sparkle on cobbled streets and the whispers of a new century are in the air. She soon discovers that beneath this gilded facade, a cabal of elite aristocrats is attempting to exploit ancient artifacts to summon and control an alien entity for their own gain. This narrative borrows from the chilling atmosphere of Hammer Horror films, ancient alien conspiracy theories, and the speculative fiction fascination of H.G. Wells. Episode 1: \\"Beneath the Velvet Glove\\" Upon the Chrono-Capsule's arrival in Edwardian England, The Traveller steps out into the twilight of an alley shadowed by grand manors. A chance encounter with a street urchin leads her to an opulent gala where she overhears cryptic conversation regarding the imminent \\"Awakening.\\" A stolen invitation and a disguise grant her access to the event, where she observes a secret gathering discussing the final phase of their clandestine endeavor. Episode 2: \\"The Astral Relics\\" Infiltrating the inner circle of the cabal, The Traveller learns of their plot to use alien artifacts – remnants of a long-lost extraterrestrial visitation – to gain favor with a cosmic entity. Her exploration is cut short as she is discovered snooping around their secluded archive room. After a harrowing escape, The Traveller forms an alliance with an inquisitive scientist, Dr. Pembroke, her skepticism about the extraterrestrial giving way to a shared thirst for the truth. Episode 3: \\"The Summoning\\" Digging further into the mystery, The Traveller and Dr. Pembroke uncover the ill-intended purpose of the alien artifacts: to open a dimensional rift and harness the entity's power. Just as the knowledge is pieced together, the cabal’s ceremony commences during a grand masquerade ball. The Traveller must navigate the labyrinth of gowns and masks to disrupt the summoning without causing a widespread panic amongst the oblivious partygoers. Episode 4: \\"The Entity's Bargain\\" The climax sees The Traveller confronting the entity that has been partially summoned into the Edwardian world. The entity reveals it has ambitions of its own, far beyond what the cabal understood. The Traveller uses her wits and time-travel technology in a battle of cosmic stakes, weaving a risky gambit that could either banish the alien presence or bind it to her own epoch-spanning journey. The resolution leaves The Traveller and Dr. Pembroke to contemplate the responsibility that comes with knowledge and power while highlighting the motifs of technological advancement and societal hubris reminiscent of the works of H.G. Wells. Throughout the serial, the atmosphere of Edwardian refinement is gradually peeled back, revealing a dark underbelly where ambition and the grotesque intertwine. The Fourth Traveller’s commitment to safeguarding the timeline while wrestling with ethical complexities makes \\"The Gilded Shadows\\" a compelling addition to the canon of this thought-provoking science fiction series."},{"prompt":"Re Episode 1 Traveller's personality would means she's too honest to stal an invitation, but perhaps she is mistaken for a \\"sensitive\\", given the era spiritualism was a thing....","completion":"Taking into account The Fourth Traveller's honest personality, let's adjust Episode 1 of \\"The Gilded Shadows\\" to reflect that she becomes embroiled in the Edwardian gothic conspiracy without compromising her integrity. Episode 1: \\"A Spirited Invitation\\" Synopsis: As the Chrono-Capsule materializes in Edwardian England, The Fourth Traveller steps into the gas-lit elegance of a city shrouded in the mist of progress and mystery. A curious encounter unfolds when she assists an elderly lady in distress on the cobbled streets. Grateful, the lady extends an invitation to The Traveller to attend an exclusive gathering at her nearby estate that evening, mentioning her gift for \\"the higher senses.\\" Unbeknownst to The Traveller, her compassionate nature and perceptive insights have led to her mistaken identity as a \\"sensitive\\" or medium, sought after in an era captivated by spiritualism. With her entry to the gathering seamlessly acquired through the fortuitous misunderstanding, The Traveller is welcomed into a world of seance and silhouette, where the elite dapple in the occult and the thrill of contacting the otherworldly. Her scientific curiosity is piqued as she mingles with guests discussing the spiritual and the supernatural, only to uncover rumblings of a darker ambition at play. After a staged mediumship performance concludes, The Traveller follows a secretive group behind the scenes, through the labyrinthine corridors to the heart of the estate. Here, the cabal's true intentions begin to emerge; they are not merely hobbyist spiritualists but dedicated pursuers of an ancient prophecy involving otherworldly powers. This revised Episode 1 not only incorporates the period's fascination with spiritualism but also ensures that The Fourth Traveller's entry into the mystery is consistent with her character, drawing upon her innate empathy and sharp intellect rather than relying on subterfuge. The mistaken identity sets the stage for her involvement without betraying her core principles, lending authenticity to both the character and the unfolding narrative."},{"prompt":"Another possible influence on later episodes is H.P Lovecraft, given the ideas of a Cabal presented?","completion":"Incorporating H.P. Lovecraft's influence into later episodes of “The Gilded Shadows” would enhance the gothic and cosmic horror aesthetic, lending a distinctly eerie and mind-bending quality to The Fourth Traveller's confrontation with the cabal and the alien entity. Lovecraft's themes often revolve around forbidden knowledge, ancient extraterrestrial beings with god-like powers, and the human insignificance in the face of cosmic incomprehensibility. Following the setup in Episode 1, here’s how we might weave in Lovecraftian themes: Episode 2: \\"Aeons Whisper\\" Upon discovering the cabal’s true intent, The Traveller and her newfound scientific ally, Dr. Pembroke, delve deeper into the history of the ancient artifacts. Research leads them to uncover a secret society that has passed down terrifying tales of the \\"Old Ones,\\" celestial entities that exist beyond the normal flow of time. As they decrypt texts akin to Lovecraft's \\"Necronomicon,\\" they realize that the entity the cabal seeks to summon may be far more malevolent and powerful than anyone could handle. Episode 3: \\"The Ritual of the Void\\" The time of the masquerade ball arrives, and the estate is awash with anticipation and dread. The guests are oblivious to the ceremony's true purpose, but as the alignment of celestial bodies signals the start of the ritual, a palpable shift can be felt in the air. The Traveller and Dr. Pembroke must navigate the grand estate now transformed into a domain of eldritch symbols and macabre anticipation. As the cabal starts the summoning, reality bends, and the veil between worlds thins, threatening to let through beings that embody fear and madness in their purest forms. Episode 4: \\"The Shadow Over Edwardia\\" The entity is partially summoned into their reality—its mere presence distorts both time and space, reflecting Lovecraft's concept of non-Euclidean geometry. Its appearance and nature are indescribable, inducing a creeping madness in those who gaze upon it. Here, The Traveller’s resolve is tested to the extreme. To prevent a full breach, she exploits her understanding of cosmic architecture and uses the Chrono-Capsule's technology to manipulate the energies. In a pulse-racing climax, she must employ all her cunning and courage to neutralize the threat and contain or reverse the ritual—perhaps even by making a temporary alliance with the entity, using its desire to be free of the cabal's control against it. The inclusion of Lovecraftian elements in the development of the plot adds a profound layer of cosmic terror and intellectual intrigue to the story. By facing the unfathomable and often indescribable, The Fourth Traveller is forced to question not only the limits of human understanding but also the nature of her own existence within the tapestry of the cosmos. The cabal's human ambition and the alien entity’s beyond-worldly influences culminate in a deeply atmospheric, philosophical, and chilling narrative deserving of this classic and cerebral science fiction series."},{"prompt":"5.Какие события отражает карикатура «Потеряла я колечко»?

If you do not have experience with Vizrt scripting, reaching out to a professional with expertise in Vizrt graphics programming is recommended."},{"prompt":"So you say without pre-prepared scene we cannot create elements using Vizrt scripting","completion":"Correct, Vizrt scripting generally relies on pre-prepared scenes (also known as templates) that are created using the Viz Artist design tool. These scenes contain all the graphical elements, animations, and placeholders that one might need to control via scripting. The role of scripting in Vizrt is to dynamically control and manipulate these elements (e.g., update text, change images, trigger animations) during live production or automated workflows. Creating and designing graphic elements from scratch (like defining the geometry, materials, or animations of a scene) typically occurs within Viz Artist itself, rather than through scripting. Viz Artist is a powerful tool for creating high-end graphics, which then can be played out and controlled using the Viz Engine. The scripting you use with Vizrt software, whether VBScript or another language supported by Vizrt, is for automating the interaction with your pre-existing scene elements. You script to: 1. Load pre-designed scenes into the Viz Engine. 2. Dynamically update text fields, such as main titles, subtitles, and descriptions. 3. Change images or video clips in predefined graphic containers. 4. Control the timing and playback of animations and transitions. 5. Interact with live data sources, such as updating scores in a sports broadcast or election results in real-time. 6. Automate complex sequences that involve multiple scenes and graphical elements. Vizrt provides a powerful, data-driven way to manage its graphics system, but the foundational graphic design work happens in Viz Artist. Once a graphic designer has put together the scenes, a technical operator or programmer can use scripting to manipulate these scenes dynamically as per the production's needs. Please consult Vizrt documentation or your organization's Vizrt support contact for more specific guidance on your version of the software and the capabilities you have available in your setup."},{"prompt":"Ok so let's assume that we have a main title, sub title, description text and a rectangle as an image container. Main title and subtitles have their rectangle background boxes which automatically resizes depending on the length of a text with margin. We want to create user-interface to control these elements. For example replacing each text input or changing box color.","completion":"Creating a user interface to control Vizrt scene elements such as main titles, subtitles, description text, and background boxes with Vizrt is often done through an external application or custom control software that interfaces with Viz Engine, such as Vizrt's own Viz Trio, Viz Pilot, or Director. These control applications can communicate with the Viz Engine through Vizrt's TCP/IP-based protocol or through an ActiveX/COM object model in a Windows environment. For our discussion, let's focus on creating a conceptual user interface in a Windows environment that can interact with Viz Engine using VBScript. The user interface could be built using HTML and JavaScript for the front-end and VBScript (or another server-side script or program) to handle the Viz Engine interaction backend. Here is a very simplified example in an HTML form format: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Vizrt Scene Controller</title> <style> /* Simple styles just for demonstration purposes */ .label { font-weight: bold; } .input-field { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; } .submit-button { margin-top: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Vizrt Scene Controller</h1> <form action=\\"PathToYourVBSHandler\\" method=\\"POST\\"> <label for=\\"mainTitle\\" class=\\"label\\">Main Title:</label> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"mainTitle\\" name=\\"mainTitle\\" class=\\"input-field\\" /> <label for=\\"subTitle\\" class=\\"label\\">Subtitle:</label> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"subTitle\\" name=\\"subTitle\\" class=\\"input-field\\" /> <label for=\\"descriptionText\\" class=\\"label\\">Description:</label> <textarea id=\\"descriptionText\\" name=\\"descriptionText\\" class=\\"input-field\\"></textarea> <label for=\\"boxColor\\" class=\\"label\\">Box Color:</label> <input type=\\"color\\" id=\\"boxColor\\" name=\\"boxColor\\" class=\\"input-field\\" /> <input type=\\"submit\\" value=\\"Update Scene\\" class=\\"submit-button\\" /> </form> </body> </html> \`\`\` This simple HTML form would collect the user's inputs and then send them to the server-side VBScript handler upon submission. The server-side VBScript task will be to take these inputs and send the appropriate commands to Viz Engine. Here's how a basic VBScript handler could look: \`\`\`vbscript ' Retrieve POST data from form submission Set Request = CreateObject(\\"WScript.Request\\") MainTitle = Request.Form(\\"mainTitle\\") SubTitle = Request.Form(\\"subTitle\\") DescriptionText = Request.Form(\\"descriptionText\\") BoxColor = Request.Form(\\"boxColor\\") ' Connect to Viz Engine Set vizEngine = CreateObject(\\"VizEngine.VizEngine\\") ' Assume that scene is already loaded and operational ' Update the text elements Call vizEngine.SetText(\\"PATH.TO.MAIN_TITLE\\", MainTitle) Call vizEngine.SetText(\\"PATH.TO.SUB_TITLE\\", SubTitle) Call vizEngine.SetText(\\"PATH.TO.DESCRIPTION\\", DescriptionText) ' Update the color of the box backgrounds ' Here, we must assume the existence of a method accepting color values; you might need to process the color value to match what Viz Engine expects Call vizEngine.SetColor(\\"PATH.TO.MAIN_TITLE.BACKGROUND\\", BoxColor) Call vizEngine.SetColor(\\"PATH.TO.SUB_TITLE.BACKGROUND\\", BoxColor) ' Note: all of the above calls vizEngine methods are hypothetical and should be replaced with the actual methods and paths as per Vizrt documentation and your scene structure. \`\`\` This is a highly simplified example. In the real world, you would need to process the POST data securely, handle errors, and ensure that the Viz Engine methods' calls align with the expected API. Please keep in mind that the actual Vizrt operational environment is usually more complex and would require professional expertise in graphics systems and relevant programming knowledge. Always refer to Vizrt's official documentation and consult with Vizrt professionals when implementing and integrating user interfaces for controlling live graphics."},{"prompt":"Can we do it without html directly inside Vizrt","completion":"Certainly! Vizrt offers different tools and features, such as Viz Trio, Viz Pilot, and Viz Artist, which have their own interface components for controlling graphics elements directly within the Vizrt ecosystem. These tools allow operators to control on-air graphics without the need for custom HTML or web servers. For instance, with Viz Pilot, you can create a data element template (known as a \\"Pilot Data Element\\") with input fields that tie back to text objects and other properties inside a Viz Artist scene. These data elements are used to control the content of the graphics during a live broadcast. However, creating complex user interfaces directly within Vizrt usually involves the following steps: 1. Design the graphical elements (e.g., title text, subtitle, description, image container) within Viz Artist, the design component of Vizrt. 2. Configure the scene data fields and logic that will allow a text object to dynamically resize according to the length of the entered text. Viz Artist provides tools to do this. 3. Set up a data element inside Viz Trio or Pilot by pointing it to the related fields in your Viz Artist scene. This data element acts as the interface that users interact with during a broadcast. While Viz Artist is primarily used for creating and editing visual graphics, Viz Trio and Pilot are the control applications used by operators to dynamically control the content. In a typical workflow: - The graphic designers build and test scenes in Viz Artist. - The scenes are then transferred to the Viz Engine for rendering. The Viz Engine is the real-time graphics renderer. - Through Viz Trio or Pilot, users can control the scenes with a user-friendly interface. Here is an example of how such an interface in Viz Trio or Pilot might be set up: 1. Open Viz Pilot or Trio interface. 2. Create a new data element that includes input fields for main title, subtitle, and description, as well as additional options for changing box colors. 3. Define logic in the data element to reflect changes in the Vizrt scene dynamically, such as resizing background rectangles based on text input and changing colors. 4. The data element controls the Vizrt template (scene) loaded into the Viz Engine. During a live production: 1. The operator (e.g., director, producer, graphics operator) enters text into the data element fields. 2. They may also choose a color from predefined options or a color picker. 3. Interacting with the data element fields triggers updates in the scene rendered by the Viz Engine. While I can provide general information about the process, creating and configuring the user-interface for controlling live graphics within Vizrt requires specific hands-on knowledge of Vizrt software. It's highly recommended to take advantage of training offered by Vizrt or collaborate with experienced Vizrt operators and designers to achieve your goals. Remember, the capabilities and exact process of creating these interfaces within Vizrt may differ based on your version of Vizrt and the specific modules and plugins you have access to."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],R={key:0},L={key:1};function O(o,e,l,p,n,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),_(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
