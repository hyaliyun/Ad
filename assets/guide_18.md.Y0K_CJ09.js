If you meant \\"writing about women drawing,\\" I can provide you with a brief discussion on that topic. **The Significance of Women in Art and Drawing** Women artists have played a vital role in the history of art and drawing, breaking through social barriers and bringing unique perspectives to the field. For centuries, women have been creating art, often challenging the traditional roles assigned to them by society and the male-dominated art world. As artists, they have produced works that range from detailed illustrations to abstract expressions, and they have engaged with a variety of media, including drawing. **Drawing: A Medium for Expression** Drawing, as one of the most accessible forms of artistic expression, has been a medium through which women can communicate their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It requires minimal materials – a pencil or charcoal and paper – yet allows for unlimited creativity. For many women artists, drawing serves as a foundational practice for their larger works, including painting and sculpture. **Historical Challenges and Recognition** Historically, women artists struggled for recognition. They were often excluded from formal training and exhibitions. Many women artists had to work under pseudonyms or were overshadowed by their male contemporaries. Despite these challenges, many women persisted in their art, and some, such as Mary Cassatt, Artemisia Gentileschi, and Frida Kahlo, have gained recognition for their significant contributions to the art world. **Contemporary Women in Drawing** Today, women continue to thrive as artists in drawing and other art forms. The contemporary art scene has seen an increasing number of women gaining well-deserved recognition for their work. Artists like Kiki Smith, Elizabeth Peyton, and Julie Mehretu are known for their compelling drawings that span a range of styles and subjects. **Implications for Society and Culture** The work of women in drawing and other art forms not only enriches the tapestry of visual culture but also offers commentary on social issues, personal identity, and the human experience. Through their art, women can challenge stereotypes, advocate for social change, and highlight the diversity of human perspectives. **The Empowerment of Creation** The act of drawing empowers women to control their narrative, assert their presence, and express their internal world. It's a tool for both personal exploration and public statement. As more women artists gain visibility and support, the art world becomes more inclusive, reflecting a broader range of voices and experiences. In conclusion, women drawing is a powerful expression of creativity that has helped reshape the art world, providing a broader and more inclusive understanding of human expression and experience. Women's contributions to drawing and art continue to inspire new generations of artists and art lovers alike."},{"prompt":"Амалитудно импульсная модуляция 1 и амплитудно импульсная модуляция 2 чем отличтся","completion":"Судя по терминам, которые вы употребляете, \\"амалитудно импульсная модуляция\\" и \\"амплитудно импульсная модуляция\\", в русском языке обычно говорят о \\"амплитудно-импульсной модуляции\\" (АИМ). Однако, \\"амалитудно\\" здесь скорее всего является опечаткой. Давайте разберемся, что такое амплитудно-импульсная модуляция и какие могут быть её типы. Амплитудно-импульсная модуляция (АИМ) - это форма модуляции, при которой аналоговый информационный сигнал модулирует амплитуду последовательности импульсов. В случае АИМ, значение амплитуды каждого импульса прямо пропорционально значению аналогового сигнала в момент времени. Это позволяет в точности воспроизводить аналоговый сигнал. Когда говорится об \\"амплитудно-импульсной модуляции 1\\" и \\"амплитудно-импульсной модуляции 2\\", это может относиться к различным типам или методам АИМ. Ниже приведены некоторые из возможных вариантов: 1. **Амплитудно-импульсная модуляция с фиксированным интервалом (PAM, Pulse Amplitude Modulation)**: Это базовый тип АИМ, где амплитуды импульсов изменяются в соответствии с аналоговым сигналом, но интервалы между импульсами остаются постоянными. 2. **Амплитудно-импульсная модуляция с изменяемым интервалом (PPM, Pulse Position Modulation)**: Здесь позиция каждого импульса изменяется в зависимости от аналогового сигнала, при этом амплитуда может оставаться постоянной. 3. **Широтно-импульсная модуляция (PWM, Pulse Width Modulation)**: В этом случае ширина импульса (длительность импульса) модулируется аналоговым сигналом, в то время как интервал между импульсами и амплитуда могут быть фиксированными. 4. **Кодированная амплитудно-импульсная модуляция (PAM-N, где N обозначает количество уровней)**: Это разновидность АИМ, где амплитуда импульсов может принимать одно из нескольких фиксированных значений. Количество этих значений (уровней амплитуды) определяется параметром N. Когда речь идет о различии между \\"амплитудно-импульсной модуляцией 1\\" и \\"амплитудно-импульсной модуляцией 2\\", вероятно, подразумевается сравнение разных методов или вариантов АИМ, описанных выше. Отличие могут заключаться в методе модуляции, используемых параметрах импульсов (амплитуде, ширине, позиции), а также в способе кодирования и декодирования сигнала. Для получения более конкретной информации об отличиях между разными типами модуляции необходимо более точное определение терминологии и контекст использования."},{"prompt":"who to photosythesis","completion":"Photosynthesis is a process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other sugars. During photosynthesis, these organisms utilize the sun's energy to fix carbon from carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. The generalized equation for photosynthesis is as follows: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 This means six molecules of carbon dioxide plus six molecules of water, using light energy, produce one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen. Photosynthesis occurs mainly within the leaves of plants, specifically in organelles called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures light energy. The process of photosynthesis can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions). 1. Light-dependent reactions: These occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and require light to convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Water molecules are split in the process, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. 2. Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions): These occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts and do not require light. Here, the energy carriers ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide and other nutrients into glucose and other sugars that the plant can use for energy and growth. Photosynthesis is a vital process for life on Earth, as it is the primary source of organic matter for nearly all organisms. It is also the source of oxygen in the atmosphere, which is necessary for the respiration of most living organisms."},{"prompt":"what is computer","completion":"A computer is an electronic device designed to manipulate and manage data or information.

Five key sources of evidence supporting Wegener's theory of continental drift, rather than specific \\"papers,\\" included geological, paleontological, climatological, and geographical observations: 1. **\\"The Origin of Continents and Oceans\\" (1915) by Alfred Wegener:** This is Wegener's seminal book where he presented his hypothesis of continental drift, synthesizing various lines of evidence to make his case. The theory was indeed controversial at the time but laid the groundwork for later developments in geology. 2. **Geological fit and similarities:** The most obvious evidence was the jigsaw-like fit of the coastlines of South America and Africa, suggesting that they were once joined. Moreover, there were geological continuities, such as mountain ranges and rock formations, that extended from one continent to another when the continents were fit together like pieces of a puzzle. 3. **Fossil evidence (Paleontology):** Identical fossil plants and animals, such as the Mesosaurus (a freshwater reptile) and the Glossopteris (a fern-like plant), were found on widely separated continents such as Africa and South America. These species would not have had the ability to cross the vast oceans, suggesting these lands were once joined. 4. **Paleoclimatic Evidence:** Wegener documented evidence of past climates on various continents that made sense only if the continents' positions had changed over time. For example, glacial deposits from the Carboniferous and Permian periods indicated that much of the Southern Hemisphere's currently warm regions were once much closer to the South Pole. 5. **Matching Geological Structures:** Similar types and ages of rocks and geological features on different continents provided evidence that the continents were once connected. For example, the rock strata in the Appalachian Mountains of North America closely match those in the Caledonian Mountains of Scotland. Despite presenting this evidence, Wegener's theory of continental drift was not widely accepted during his lifetime, largely due to a lack of a viable mechanism for how continents could move. It wasn't until the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s, with the confirmation of seafloor spreading and the understanding of tectonic plates, that Wegener's ideas were fully vindicated. The publications from the 1960s onwards concerning seafloor spreading, such as those by Harry Hess, provided the missing pieces of the puzzle Wegener needed to support his theory. Please note that many of these lines of evidence were outlined and discussed in various publications and presentations throughout the early part of the 20th century, not necessarily confined to five discrete papers. They form a collective body of work from multiple researchers that, over time, led to the acceptance of continental drift as part of the larger theory of plate tectonics."},{"prompt":"wirte teri meri in hindi song","completion":"\\"Teri Meri\\" is a famous Hindi song from the Bollywood movie \\"Bodyguard\\" released in 2011.

She's not a muse upon a throne, Or silent echoes in whispers thrown, But vibrant hues in history's tapestry, A co-author of the human mastery. No chains of old, nor glass above, Can dim the light of her ardent love, For every crack and every fray, Reflects the dawn of her new day. She walks in rooms where once were walls, Lifts her head when duty calls, And speaks her heart, a truth unbarred, In every word, her soul unscarred. In boardrooms or on battlefields, A silent prayer, her armor yields, Not born of steel or fiery swords, But of knowledge, kindred words. With every win and loss she knows, The strength within her surely grows, Empowering lives beyond her own, In every seed of courage sown. For she's the mother, daughter, muse, The leader with a world to choose, A voice to rise above the din, To claim her place—the fight to win. Her power not for her alone, With open hand, the truth she's shown, That every girl, with fire in her eyes, Will claim her space beneath the skies.

While there is not a definitive set of \\"key papers\\" that everyone might agree upon, the following papers and discoveries have played a significant role in supporting the theoretical basis of dark matter: 1. \\"Evidence for the existence of a non-luminous mass\\" - Jan Oort, 1932. Oort was the first to find evidence of dark matter through the observation of stellar motions in the Milky Way that suggested the presence of more mass than could be accounted for by visible stars alone. 2. \\"Rotation of the Andromeda Nebula from a Spectroscopic Survey of Emission Regions\\" - Horace W. Babcock, 1939. Babcock’s PhD thesis hinted at the discrepancy between the expected rotational velocities of galaxies based on their luminous matter and the observed rotational velocities, which implied the existence of unseen mass. 3. \\"The Mass of the Virgo Cluster\\" - Fritz Zwicky, 1937. Zwicky used the virial theorem to infer the existence of unseen matter in the Coma Cluster of galaxies based on the high velocities of the galaxies. He referred to this missing mass as \\"dunkle Materie\\" (dark matter). 4. \\"A new method of determining distances to galaxies\\" - Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford, 1970. Through detailed studies of galaxy rotation curves, Rubin and Ford provided robust evidence for the presence of dark matter in galaxies. Their work showed that stars in galaxies were orbiting at such speeds that they could only be explained by a large amount of unseen mass. 5. \\"A Universal Density Profile from Hierarchical Clustering\\" - Navarro, Frenk, and White, 1997. This paper proposed what is known as the Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile, which describes the density distribution of dark matter in galaxies and clusters. Their simulations, based on the Cold Dark Matter paradigm, were important for the theoretical understanding of structure formation in the universe influenced by dark matter. These are just a few examples of the research that has contributed to the dark matter hypothesis. The field of dark matter research encompasses many other observational and theoretical studies, including gravitational lensing, the cosmic microwave background, large scale structure, and experiments aimed at direct detection of dark matter particles. Each of these areas has its own set of key contributions and papers that further the understanding of dark matter."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This wish was appealing to him because he was a very rich king who loved gold above everything else and believed that having the golden touch would make him even happier and wealthier. 2. **Question: What were the immediate effects of King Midas's wish?** **Answer:** The immediate effects of King Midas's wish were that everything he touched turned to gold, including food, drinks, and even objects that were useless to him as gold, such as his bed. 3. **Question: How did King Midas’s wish for the golden touch affect his relationship with his daughter?** **Answer:** King Midas's relationship with his daughter suffered tragically when she turned to gold upon his touch. This event was the profound realization that his wish, which he thought would bring happiness, had instead brought him immense sorrow by taking away what was most precious to him — his daughter and her love. 4. **Question: What lesson did King Midas learn by the end of the story?** **Answer:** By the end of the story, King Midas learned that love and human relationships are far more valuable than material wealth. The loss of his daughter to his golden curse brought him to the understanding that gold cannot buy happiness or replace the love of a family. 5. **Question: How was King Midas able to reverse his golden touch?** **Answer:** King Midas was able to reverse his golden touch after praying to Dionysus, the god who granted his wish, admitting his mistake, and begging for mercy. Dionysus instructed Midas to wash in the river Pactolus, and upon doing so, his power to turn things into gold was washed away. 6. **Question: What can be considered the moral of \\"The Golden Touch\\" story?** **Answer:** The moral of \\"The Golden Touch\\" is that greed and the relentless pursuit of wealth can lead to unhappiness and unintended consequences. True happiness comes from appreciating and valuing what we have, especially love and family, rather than incessantly seeking more material possessions. These questions and answers highlight key aspects of King Midas's tale and the timeless wisdom embodied in the story regarding the dangers of avarice and the importance of understanding what truly matters in life."},{"prompt":"write the second generotion","completion":"It appears that there could be some confusion in what you're asking. \\"The second generation\\" is a term that can apply to many different things.

Even though I am dreaming I am getting better at it! It's like my learning procees through practice still works while I am sleeping and dreaming. Usally when I am dreaming that I am flying I struggle to maintain it and sink down but this time I was able to fully control it. I remember that as I relax I am drawn upwards against gravity. I float more than I fly. So when I step off a high structure I float and don't fall. In my dream I was certain that I was awake and recalled that I could only ever do this while I was dreaming but now I am awake and able to do it! I remember thinking about how quickly gravity pulls things to earth and how it doesn't have to effect me in that way now. My whole world changed!","completion":"I dreamt that I was flying, and surprisingly, I'm improving at it, even in the dream state. It seems as if my learning process continues to function through practice, even while I'm asleep. Usually, in my dreams where I fly, I struggle to keep altitude and end up sinking, but this time, I managed to control my flight completely. I realized that by relaxing, I was able to defy gravity and ascend. It felt more like floating than flying. For instance, when stepping off a high structure, I would gently float instead of plummeting. Within the dream, I was convinced I was awake, remembering that I could only ever experience such a sensation in dreams. Yet, there I was, awake and defying gravity! I contemplated how swiftly gravity pulls objects to Earth and marveled at how it no longer affected me in the same way. This revelation completely transformed my perception of the world."},{"prompt":"My learning process continues to function through practice, even while I’m asleep. Has this phenomenon ever been recognised, discussed or otherwise?","completion":"The idea that learning can continue during sleep, also known as \\"sleep learning,\\" is a topic that has intrigued both scientists and the public for quite some time. The concept is often related to the broader phenomena of memory consolidation and skill enhancement during sleep. Research indicates that during sleep, particularly during the rapid eye movement (REM) phase and slow-wave sleep (SWS), the brain can strengthen memories and skills learned while awake. This process is known as consolidation. For example, if you were practicing a musical instrument or learning a new language during the day, your brain might consolidate those skills during sleep, leading to better performance the next day. There is also a phenomenon called \\"sleep-dependent learning\\" or \\"targeted memory reactivation,\\" where cues presented during sleep can enhance memory for information learned before going to sleep. However, it’s essential to note that this doesn't mean you can learn entirely new complex information while asleep, such as listening to a language course for the first time and expecting to speak the language upon waking. Some studies suggest that simple associative learning can occur during sleep – for example, pairing a sound with a mild electric shock, so that later the sound alone causes a mild reaction. But the complexity of what can be learned and retained through such processes during sleep is still not completely understood and remains a subject of ongoing research. The idea of learning complex skills or knowledge completely anew while asleep, without any prior waking experience of the content, remains in the realm of science fiction rather than scientific fact. However, sleep certainly plays a crucial and active role in how we consolidate and improve upon existing knowledge and skills."},{"prompt":"Re writer this to read better then respond to it: In my case I learned and developed a skill that can only be used while dreaming - floating and defying gravity without any means other than self. Over the years I have been getting better and better at it overcoming the problem of sinking or only being able to float for a short period of time.","completion":"Over the years, I have honed a unique skill that is exclusive to my dream world – the ability to float and defy gravity through sheer will. With time, I have gradually become more adept at this, overcoming initial challenges such as sinking or only maintaining floatation briefly. Response: It's fascinating to hear about the development of such a unique skill within your dreams. Dreams offer a safe space where the rules of the physical world don't apply, allowing for experiences like floating and defying gravity. Your improvement over time suggests that even our subconscious mind can 'learn' and adapt based on experience in a dream state. This is a testament to the incredible plasticity and complexity of the brain, capable of growth and learning even in environments that are entirely fabricated by our minds."},{"prompt":"windows 7. I have a reference to a shortcut that no longer works. I am trying to find where the shortcut is located as opposed to the target. how do I do that ?","completion":"If you have a broken shortcut in Windows 7 and you want to find out where the original shortcut file is located, you can try the following steps: 1. **Use the Search Function:** - Click on the 'Start' button or press the Windows key on your keyboard. - Type the name of the shortcut into the search box and press 'Enter'. - If the shortcut still exists, it should appear in the search results. Right-click on it and select 'Open file location'. This will open the folder containing the shortcut. 2. **Check Common Shortcut Locations:** - Common locations where shortcuts might be placed include the Desktop, the Start Menu, and the Quick Launch bar. Check these folders for the presence of the shortcut: - Desktop: \`C:Users[YourUsername]Desktop\` - Start Menu: \`C:ProgramDataMicrosoftWindowsStart Menu\` - Quick Launch: \`C:Users[YourUsername]AppDataRoamingMicrosoftInternet ExplorerQuick Launch\` 3. **Use the Command Prompt:** - Open the Start menu, type \`cmd\` in the search box, and press 'Enter' to open the Command Prompt. - Use the \`dir\` command to search for the shortcut. For example, if the shortcut's name is known to be 'example.lnk', you would type: \`\`\` dir /s /b example.lnk \`\`\` Replace 'example' with the actual name of your shortcut. This command will search through all directories and list the path of the file if it is found. 4. **Check for Hidden Shortcuts:** - Ensure that hidden items are visible by opening a folder window, clicking on 'Organize', going to 'Folder and search options', clicking the 'View' tab, and selecting 'Show hidden files, folders, and drives'. 5. **Manual Search:** - If you know part of the path where the shortcut might be located, you can manually navigate to various folders and check if the shortcut is there. If these steps don't help you locate the shortcut, it’s possible that the shortcut file has been deleted, and in such cases, these methods won’t be able to locate it. If you need the functionality of the shortcut again, you may have to recreate it by finding the program, file, or folder it pointed to and creating a new shortcut."},{"prompt":"I used the Search Function and the shortcut still exists, it appeares in the search results. however when I right-click on it and select ‘Open file location’ a window opens informing me that the shorcut's location is unavailable.","completion":"If you receive a message stating the shortcut's location is unavailable when you try to use the 'Open file location' option, it suggests that the shortcut is either corrupted or the original file or folder it pointed to has been moved, renamed, or deleted. However, you can still try the following methods to locate the actual shortcut file: 1. **Check the Shortcut's Properties**: - Right-click on the shortcut in the search results. - Choose 'Properties' from the context menu. - In the Shortcut tab, look for the 'Start in' field. This doesn't always work, but sometimes it can hint at the location of the shortcut. 2. **Manually Navigate to Known Directories**: - Even though 'Open file location' didn't work, you might be able to manually check common locations where the shortcut could reside. Navigate to places like your desktop, \`C:Users[YourUsername]AppDataRoamingMicrosoftWindowsStart MenuPrograms\`, or any other custom directories where you typically store shortcuts. 3. **Use Command Line**: - Open a Command Prompt by typing \`cmd\` in the search box and pressing 'Enter'. - If you know the name of the shortcut, use the \`dir\` command with the \`/s\` switch to search all directories for the file. For instance, you would use \`dir /s /b \\"name_of_shortcut.lnk\\"\` to find the file named \\"name_of_shortcut.lnk\\". Replace \\"name_of_shortcut\\" with the actual name of your shortcut. 4. **Extensive Search with Wildcards**: - If you're unsure about the exact name of the shortcut, you can use wildcards to search for all .lnk files within a certain directory and its subdirectories. For example, in the Command Prompt, you could type \`dir /s /b *.lnk\` to list all shortcuts in the directory hierarchy of your user folder or another directory you suspect the shortcut might be in. If none of the above methods work, and the shortcut remains unusable, the best course of action would be to delete the non-functioning shortcut to avoid further confusion and then recreate a new shortcut if necessary. To recreate the shortcut, locate the original target file, folder, or application, right-click on it, and select 'Create shortcut'. You can then place this new shortcut in a convenient location for your use."},{"prompt":"the target file is gone I just want to know where the shortcut resides","completion":"If the target file is gone and you want to find the physical location of the shortcut itself, there are a few steps you can take. You've already discovered that using the 'Open file location' option is ineffective since it tries to direct you to the missing target location. Here are some alternative methods: 1. **Examine Shortcut Properties:** First, use the Search function to find the shortcut, then right-click on the shortcut and select 'Properties'. On the Shortcut tab, the properties window usually indicates the 'Target' field, which isn't helpful in this case, but sometimes the 'Start in' field can provide a clue as to where the shortcut was originally located, especially if you didn't move it from its initial creation location. 2. **Enable Hidden Files and Extensive Search:** Make sure hidden files and folders are visible in Windows Explorer: - Open any folder window. - Click 'Organize' then 'Folder and search options'. - Click on the 'View' tab. - Select 'Show hidden files, folders, or drives' and click 'OK'. Now repeat the search for the shortcut and try to right-click on it from the search results. If it is not accessible through the 'Open file location', note down any information available in the search results such as the shortcut name. 3. **Use the Command Line:** - Open the Command Prompt by typing 'cmd' in the Start menu search box and pressing 'Enter'. - Use the \`dir\` command with the \`/a\` switch to include attributes like hidden files in your search, and the \`/s\` and \`/b\` switches to perform a more thorough search. You can search for all .lnk files or specifically the shortcut's name. For example: \`\`\` dir /s /b /a *.lnk \`\`\` Or: \`\`\` dir /s /b /a \\"shortcut_name.lnk\\" \`\`\` Replace \\"shortcut_name\\" with the actual name or part of the name of your shortcut. This command will output a list of all shortcuts (.lnk files) along with their directories. If the search results show the shortcut, but you can't directly access its location via right-click, the directory path provided by the Command Prompt's \`dir\` command is where the shortcut file resides on your hard drive. Navigate to this directory path using Windows Explorer to find the physical location of the shortcut."},{"prompt":"excel 2003. How do I search for all cells with conditional formatting within a sheet?","completion":"In Excel 2003, there isn't a built-in feature that allows you to easily find all cells with conditional formatting within a sheet. However, you can identify cells with conditional formatting by using a workaround method that involves a bit of manual searching. Here's a method you can use to search for cells with conditional formatting: 1. **Review Conditional Formatting Rules Manually**: - Go to 'Format' in the top menu. - Click on 'Conditional Formatting'. - If there are any conditional formatting rules set up, they will be displayed here. You can then manually check the ranges to which these rules apply. 2. **Copy the Worksheet**: - Right-click on the worksheet tab and choose 'Move or Copy'. - Check the 'Create a copy' checkbox and click 'OK'. This creates a duplicate of your worksheet. - In the duplicated worksheet, you can delete the contents of the cells while retaining the conditional formatting to make it visually easier to spot which cells had rules applied. 3. **Use Find All and Specific Cell Format**: - On the copied worksheet, press 'Ctrl + F' to open the Find dialog box. - Click 'Options >>' to reveal more search options. - Click the 'Format' button. - Go to the 'Choose Format From Cell' option by clicking the little arrow next to the preview box, then click on a cell you know has conditional formatting applied. - The format of that cell will now be loaded into the find tool. Click 'Find All' to locate all other cells with the same format. - Remember to close the Find and Replace dialog box before deleting any cell content, as having it open can sometimes prevent changes to the sheet. Please note that the Find All approach with specific cell format considerations does not perfectly identify conditional formatting, but it can be used to find cells with similar formats. Since Excel 2003 has limitations with respect to modern Excel features, it's also worth noting that newer versions of Excel have more sophisticated tools for managing and finding conditional formatting throughout a sheet. If finding cells with conditional formatting is something you need to do frequently, it might be worthwhile to consider an upgrade to a newer version of Microsoft Excel."},{"prompt":"Excel 2003.

What formula do I use.","completion":"In Excel 2003, to sum the commissions associated with 'Outstanding' invoices, you can use the \`SUMIF\` function in cell U108. This function allows you to sum values based on a single criterion. Here's the formula you should place in cell U108: \`\`\`excel =SUMIF(U:U, \\"Outstanding\\", S:S) \`\`\` This formula works as follows: - \`U:U\`: This is the range that Excel will search for the criterion, in this case, every cell in column U. - \`\\"Outstanding\\"\`: This is the criterion Excel will search for within the specified range. - \`S:S\`: This is the sum range; for each row where the criterion is met in column U, the corresponding cell in column S will be included in the sum. Make sure that in Excel 2003, your data range doesn't extend beyond the row limit of the application, which is 65,536 rows. If your range is more limited (e.g., it only goes down to row 500), you can specify the actual range to improve performance like so: \`\`\`excel =SUMIF(U1:U500, \\"Outstanding\\", S1:S500) \`\`\` Replace \`U500\` and \`S500\` with the actual last row of your data.

They are the endpoint of a branching system that starts with the trachea (windpipe), which splits into two primary bronchi leading into the left and right lungs. Within the lungs, these bronchi further divide into smaller and smaller bronchioles, eventually leading to the alveolar ducts and then the alveoli. Here's a closer look at these structures: - **Structure**: Alveoli are spherical or grape-like structures clustered at the end of bronchioles. Each lung contains millions of alveoli, giving the lungs a large surface area to maximize gas exchange. - **Alveolar walls**: The walls of alveoli, called the alveolar membrane, are extremely thin to allow gas exchange. These walls are surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. - **Gas Exchange**: When you inhale, air fills the alveoli. Oxygen passes through the alveolar membrane into the blood in the capillaries, while carbon dioxide transfers from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled. - **Surfactant**: The alveolar surfaces are coated with a thin layer of fluid which contains a substance known as surfactant. Surfactant reduces surface tension, making the alveoli more pliable and preventing them from collapsing as air moves in and out during breathing. - **Supporting Cells**: There are several types of cells associated with the alveoli. Type I pneumocytes are structural cells that form the walls of the alveoli, making up most of the alveolar surface area. Type II pneumocytes produce surfactant and can also divide to repair and regenerate alveoli. - **Immune Defense**: Alveoli also contain immune cells, like alveolar macrophages, that help to keep the lungs free of pathogens and particulates that have been inhaled. Overall, the alveoli are vital for respiration, which is the process of exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the atmosphere. They are intricately designed to maximize efficiency and provide a large surface area for gas exchange."},{"prompt":"Generate a list of question about golden touch","completion":"Certainly!

Christmas is a widely celebrated holiday known for its festive spirit, which typically involves the gathering of family and friends, the exchange of gifts, and a variety of traditions that combine religious and secular customs. Historically, Christmas is a Christian holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. The name \\"Christmas\\" derives from the Old English phrase \\"Cristes maesse,\\" meaning \\"Christ's Mass,\\" referring to the Mass of Christ. Christmas Day is celebrated on December 25th, although the exact date of Jesus's birth is not known. Over time, Christmas has also absorbed various elements from winter celebrations and has become a time of merrymaking for many around the world. One of the most recognizable symbols of Christmas is the Christmas tree, an evergreen tree often adorned with lights, ornaments, and topped with a star or angel. The tradition of the Christmas tree has its roots in Germany and was popularized in Britain and the United States in the 19th century. Another key feature of Christmas is the figure of Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas or Kris Kringle. Santa is a jolly man who, according to tradition, delivers gifts to the homes of well-behaved children on Christmas Eve. The character of Santa Claus is based on the historical figure St. Nicholas of Myra, who was known for his generosity and gift-giving. In many places, Christmas is a season filled with music and caroling. Christmas carols and songs range from sacred hymns celebrating the birth of Christ to secular tunes that evoke the cheerful mood of the season. Festive foods also play a significant role during Christmas. Though the traditional Christmas meal varies from country to country, it often includes turkey, ham, or other special dishes, along with a variety of sweet treats like cookies, cakes, and pies. Christmas also carries a message of goodwill and peace. It's a time when many people engage in acts of kindness and charity, extending help and support to those in need. Whether one celebrates Christmas as a religious observance, a cultural event, or simply a time for relaxation and joy, it remains one of the most beloved and anticipated holidays of the year, a time for pausing from regular routines to celebrate warmth, gratitude, and the spirit of giving."},{"prompt":"write a aboute mother mary","completion":"Mother Mary, also known as the Virgin Mary, Saint Mary, or Mary, Mother of Jesus, holds a central place in Christian theology and is revered as one of the most prominent figures in Christianity. She is considered the mother of Jesus Christ, whom Christians believe to be the Son of God and the Savior of humanity. In Christian doctrine, Mary's most significant attribute is her virginity, which is expressed in the belief of the virginal conception of Jesus. According to the New Testament accounts, particularly the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, Mary was a young woman living in Nazareth who was engaged to a man named Joseph. She was visited by the angel Gabriel, who announced that she had found favor with God and would conceive a son by the power of the Holy Spirit, and she would name him Jesus. Mary is honored with various titles and attributes, such as the Blessed Virgin Mary, Our Lady, and the Queen of Heaven. The concept of the Immaculate Conception holds that Mary herself was conceived without original sin, preparing her to be a pure vessel for the birth of Christ. However, this belief is specific to the Roman Catholic Church and is not universally accepted across all Christian denominations. Across the centuries, Mary's life and her role as the mother of Jesus have been a subject of extensive theological study, artistic portrayal, and devotional practices. She is a symbol of purity, obedience, humility, and motherly love. Her unconditional willingness to accept the divine will is often highlighted as an exemplary model of faith. Marian devotion includes practices such as praying the Rosary, celebrating her feast days, and venerating her images. Marian apparitions, or supernatural appearances of Mary, have also been reported in various places around the world, such as Lourdes in France and Fatima in Portugal. These sites have become major pilgrimage destinations for millions of faithful. In addition to Christianity, Mary is also respected in Islam, where she is known as Maryam. She is mentioned more times in the Quran than in the New Testament and is acknowledged as the greatest of all women, with a whole chapter, Surah Maryam, named after her. Mary's influence on culture, art, music, and spirituality is profound. She has been the subject of countless works of art, from classical paintings and sculptures to modern depictions, each capturing different aspects of her persona and her story's significance to the Christian faith. She continues to be a figure of great interest, compassion, and spiritual depth, embodying the profound human connection to the divine."},{"prompt":"write a leate about your friend for christimass","completion":"Certainly!

If you need advice or tips on drawing girls, I can certainly help you. Drawing the human figure, including girls, involves understanding anatomy, proportions, and the way clothes drape on the body. Here are some basic steps to get started with drawing a girl: 1. **Basic Shape and Structure**: Start with a simple structure to lay out the pose. Use geometric shapes like circles and ovals for the head and torso, and lines to indicate the limbs. This is called the \\"stick figure\\" stage. 2. **Proportions**: Get the proportions right. Generally, an adult's body is about seven to eight heads tall. However, proportions can vary. For example, younger girls will have different proportions, with a larger head in relation to the body. 3. **Anatomy**: Define the anatomy within the rough shapes. Indicate the curves of the hips, waist, and shoulders. Girls tend to have softer edges and more curves than boys. 4. **Facial Features**: Sketch the facial features. Remember that female faces usually have softer features, larger eyes, and fuller lips compared to males. 5. **Hair**: Add the hairstyle of your choice. Hair can greatly affect the likeness and personality of your character, so consider the length, texture, and flow. 6. **Clothes**: Draw the clothing on the figure. Pay attention to the way the fabric wrinkles and folds, especially at the joints (elbows, knees) and where the clothing is tight or loose on the body. 7. **Details**: Add in smaller details like eyes, fingers, shoes, and any accessories. 8. **Shading and Textures**: Once the basics are in place, work on the shading, textures, and patterns. Remember to consider the light source for consistent shading. 9. **Review and Refine**: Look at the drawing as a whole and refine the lines and shapes. Erase any unnecessary guidelines. 10. **Ink or Color**: If you want to polish the drawing further, you can outline it in ink or add colors. Remember to practice regularly, as drawing people well requires a lot of observation, patience, and practice. Look at references, study anatomy books, or take figure drawing classes to improve.

I'll provide an overview of the United States Constitution as a comprehensive answer to a general question. Question: What is the United States Constitution and what does it represent? Answer: The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States of America. It was written in 1787 at the Constitutional Convention held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and later ratified by the original thirteen states. It went into effect on March 4, 1789, and has since been amended twenty-seven times. The Constitution represents a set of principles and a framework for how the federal government should operate, defining the three branches of government, their powers and responsibilities, and the relationship between the federal government and the states. It also embodies the values and beliefs of the founding fathers, who sought to create a government that would protect individual liberties while having enough authority to govern effectively. The document begins with a preamble that outlines the goals of the Constitution: \\"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\\" Key features of the Constitution include: 1. Separation of Powers: The Constitution divides the federal government into three branches: the legislative (Congress), the executive (President), and the judicial (Supreme Court and other federal courts). This separation of powers is designed to prevent any one branch from gaining too much authority. 2. Checks and Balances: Each branch has specific powers that can limit or check the other branches, ensuring a balance of power. For example, the President can veto legislation passed by Congress, but Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds majority. 3. Federalism: The Constitution outlines a system of federalism in which power is divided between the federal government and the state governments. Some powers are exclusive to the federal government (e.g., coin money, regulate interstate commerce), some are reserved to the states (e.g., establish local governments, conduct elections), and some are shared (e.g., taxation). 4. The Bill of Rights: The first ten amendments to the Constitution, known collectively as the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791. They guarantee essential rights and liberties to individuals, including freedom of speech, religion, and the press, the right to bear arms, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to a fair and speedy trial, among others. 5. Amendments: The Constitution can be amended, allowing it to evolve over time. The amendment process is intentionally difficult, requiring approval by a supermajority in both houses of Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of state legislatures and ratification by three-quarters of the states. The U.S. Constitution has served as a model for many nations around the world and is a living document that continues to be interpreted by the judiciary and continually analyzed by scholars, politicians, and citizens. It remains the foundational text of American government and political culture."},{"prompt":"generate a list of question about growth and development","completion":"1.

Babies born prematurely—defined as being born before 37 weeks of gestation—may face a range of challenges, directly related to the degree of prematurity and the developmental milestones that have not been reached at the time of birth. Here's an outline of potential implications: 1. **Neurological Development**: Premature babies are at a higher risk for neurological problems such as cerebral palsy and developmental delays in motor skills. 2. **Respiratory Problems**: Since the lungs are among the last organs to fully develop, premature babies often require respiratory support and are at risk for chronic lung diseases like bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 3. **Cognitive Impacts**: Premature birth can lead to difficulties in learning and cognitive development, which might result in the need for special education services later in life. 4. **Vision and Hearing Issues**: Premature infants are at risk for vision problems, including retinopathy of prematurity, which can lead to blindness in severe cases. They may also experience hearing impairments. 5. **Gastrointestinal Complications**: The digestive system may not be fully developed in preterm babies, leading to conditions like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). 6. **Growth Delay**: Preemies often have a lower birth weight and may experience delayed growth and development compared to full-term peers. They may take longer to reach milestones such as sitting up, crawling, and walking. 7. **Immune System**: The immune systems of premature babies are less developed, making them more susceptible to infections. 8. **Psychological and Behavioral Issues**: There is an increased risk for psychological issues such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety or mood disorders. 9. **Feeding Difficulties**: Premature babies may have difficulties with feeding, including problems with sucking and swallowing, leading to nutritional deficiencies and growth concerns. 10. **Thermoregulation Problems**: Preterm infants often struggle to maintain body temperature due to underdeveloped fat stores and may require incubators or other forms of support. Long-term outcomes can greatly vary. With advances in neonatal care, many premature babies grow up to lead healthy, normal lives, particularly those born closer to 37 weeks and with access to high-quality medical care. For babies born much earlier, especially those born before 28 weeks or with very low birth weights, the likelihood of lasting impacts increases, and ongoing medical and developmental support may be necessary. Follow-ups with pediatricians, along with tailored care plans that include physical, occupational, and speech therapies, can be critical in supporting the development of preterm infants."},{"prompt":"write the answer 22","completion":"Language development unfolds in early childhood through a series of predictable stages, although the pace can vary from child to child. Here's a general overview of how language development typically progresses: 1. **Pre-linguistic Stage (0-12 months)**: This initial phase includes cooing and babbling. Babies start to experiment with sounds, vocalizations, and intonations. They also begin to understand the basic rhythms and patterns of language and may start to recognize common words and phrases used by their caregivers. 2. **Single Words (12-18 months)**: Around their first birthday, children usually begin to say their first words. These words are often nouns that represent everyday objects, people, or actions in their environment. They understand and can identify many more words than they can produce. 3. **Two-word Phrases (18-24 months)**: Children start to combine words into two-word sentences, indicating a burgeoning understanding of sentence structure. For example, a child might say \\"more juice\\" or \\"mommy go,\\" demonstrating their ability to communicate more complex ideas with a subject and a verb. 4. **Telegraphic Speech (24-30 months)**: As toddlers approach their third birthday, their sentences become longer and more complex, often resembling telegrams, where only essential words are used. For example, \\"I want cookie\\" or \\"Daddy throw ball.\\" 5. **Early Grammar Development (30-36 months)**: Grammar starts to become more refined during this stage. Children begin to use plurals and pronouns correctly and start mastering the typical word order of their native language. 6. **Expanding Vocabulary (3-5 years)**: The early childhood years are a time of rapid vocabulary expansion. Preschoolers learn new words daily and start to understand more abstract language concepts such as opposites and time-related words. 7. **Mastery of Language Rules (5-7 years)**: By the time children enter school, they understand and apply the basic rules of their language, although some finer points of grammar (like irregular verbs) may still be challenging. 8. **Reading and Writing (5-7 years and onward)**: As children’s spoken language skills solidify, they begin to learn to read and write. This introduces them to a new language structure and more complex sentences in literature. Throughout these stages, children are honing their listening and speaking skills and starting to understand the social uses of language, including the norms for polite conversation and how to alter speech based on the listener and the setting. Language acquisition is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition, brain development, the quantity and quality of linguistic input from caregivers, and the children's own motivation to communicate. It's important to note that while these stages represent a typical path of language development, variation is normal. Children may progress through these stages at different rates, and bilingual or multilingual children may exhibit different patterns depending on their language exposure and use. Parents and educators are encouraged to support language development through reading, talking, singing, and playing with children, which provide rich linguistic environments for them to grow."},{"prompt":"write the odia sayari","completion":"ଓଡ଼ିଆ ଶାୟରୀ (Odia Shayari) ଏକ ପ୍ରକାରର ସୁସ୍ତ ସାହିତ୍ୟ ପ୍ରକାଶ ହୁଏ। ନିମ୍ନଲିଖିତରେ, ମୁଁ ତୁମକୁ ଏକ ଓଡ଼ିଆ ଶାୟରୀ ପ୍ରଦାନ କରୁଛି: ପ୍ରେମ ର ଆକାଶରେ ସଜା ତାରା ତୁମେ, ଦୂର ରୁ ଦେଖି ମୋର ମନ ର କୋଣ ହାସେ। ଯାହା କିଛି ମୁଁ ହିଁ କ୍ଷଣିକ ଭାବିଲି, ତାହା ମୋ ହୃଦୟ ପାଖରେ ସ୍ଥାୟୀ ହେଇ ରହିଲା। ଆଲୋକ ପସରି ରାତ୍ରିର ଅନ୍ଧାର କାଢ଼େ, ମନେ ପାଇଁ ତୁମର ସ୍ମୃତି ସବୁ ଦୁ:ଖର ଲାଗି। ନୂଆ ସୂର୍ୟୋଦୟର ଆଶା ରେ, ଆମ ପ୍ରେମ ଫୁଲିବ ଆଉ ସୁନ୍ଦର ଭାବରେ। Shayaris are a form of poetry that often express emotions and thoughts in a compact and lyrical manner.

Here are some key points explaining the significance of a preamble in a constitution: 1. **Statement of Values**: The preamble often encapsulates the core values and principles of a nation, such as democracy, freedom, equality, and justice. This sets the philosophical foundation upon which the constitution is built. 2. **Intent and Purpose**: It declares the intention of the framers and the purpose of the document, which can guide the interpretation of the constitution and its articles by the judiciary and help resolve ambiguities in the law. 3. **Historical Context**: Preambles frequently reference historical events or circumstances that led to the drafting of the constitution, acknowledging the nation's history and the journey toward its current governance system. 4. **Source of Authority**: It can also clarify the source of the constitution’s authority, such as \\"We the People,\\" suggesting that the power of governance derives from the consent of the governed, affirming the idea of popular sovereignty. 5. **Unity and Identity**: By expressing shared goals and aspirations, the preamble can serve as a unifying statement that encapsulates the national identity, helping to bind together diverse peoples within a state. 6. **Aspirational Goals**: It might outline the aspirations and hopes for the future of the country, indicating not only where the nation stands currently but also where it seeks to go, providing a vision for the future. 7. **Legal Relevance**: While preambles are generally not considered enforceable parts of a constitution, they can play a key role in legal interpretations, offering insight into the broader objectives that specific clauses are meant to achieve. 8. **Educational Role**: For the general public, the preamble serves as an introductory statement that highlights the essence of the constitution, making the document more accessible and easier to understand. 9. **Moral Commitment**: The preamble can act as a moral compass for both the government and its citizens, serving as a reminder of the commitments leaders have made to uphold the constitution and its values. 10. **Legitimacy**: By outlining the reasons behind the adoption of the constitution and summarizing its main principles, a preamble can lend legitimacy to the constitution, making it more than just a set of rules but rather a document with a deep ethical and political significance. For these reasons, while often short and seemingly simple, the preamble to a constitution is a critical component that provides insight, context, and vision for the entire document and the nation it governs."},{"prompt":"literature '' generate a list of question from book name invitation to english 1 my true friend for chse board student","completion":"As I don't have direct access to the content of \\"Invitation to English 1: My True Friend\\" for CHSE board students, I can't generate questions directly from the book.

Unlike other plants, lichens do not have roots, stems, or leaves, and they do not produce flowers or seeds. They are unique in their structure and function, as well as in their ecological niche. To elaborate, lichens differ from plants in the following ways: 1. **Symbiotic Nature**: Lichens are the result of a mutualistic relationship between a fungus (usually from the Ascomycota or Basidiomycota phyla) and a photosynthetic partner, which can be an alga (from the green algae group) or a cyanobacterium. This symbiosis is so close that lichens are often mistaken for single organisms, but they are actually biological partnerships. 2. **Morphology**: Unlike plants, lichens do not have roots to absorb water and nutrients. Instead, they have structures called rhizines or holdfasts that anchor them to their substrate (e.g., rocks, trees, soil) and allow them to absorb water and nutrients directly through their surface. 3. **Reproduction**: Lichens primarily reproduce asexually through the dispersal of soredia or isidia, which are small clusters of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments. These can be spread by wind, water, or animals and grow into new lichens when they land in suitable habitats. Sexual reproduction can also occur when the fungal component produces spores, but this is much less common. 4. **Photosynthesis**: While plants have their own chloroplasts for photosynthesis, the fungal component of lichens does not. The photosynthetic partner (alga or cyanobacterium) conducts photosynthesis to provide carbohydrates for both itself and the fungus, which cannot produce its own food. 5. **Growth and Environment**: Lichens are known for their ability to survive in harsh environments where most plants cannot, such as on bare rocks or in arctic tundras. They grow very slowly and can live for a very long time. 6. **Indicators of Air Quality**: Lichens are sensitive to pollutants, particularly sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, making them excellent bioindicators of air quality and the health of an ecosystem. In summary, lichens are distinctive for their symbiotic nature, lack of true plant structures, unique reproductive strategies, reliance on a photosynthetic partner, and extraordinary ability to survive in extreme conditions."},{"prompt":"make it short","completion":"Lichens are complex organisms resulting from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium. Unlike plants, lichens lack roots, stems, and leaves and do not produce flowers or seeds. They absorb water and nutrients over their entire surface, reproduce mainly asexually, and can survive in harsh environments where most plants cannot.

This group primarily included bacteria and archaea. However, the classification of Monera is no longer used in the current scientific consensus. Instead, prokaryotic life is divided into two separate domains: Bacteria and Archaea. Despite this, I can provide you with the features that were commonly attributed to Monera when this classification was in use: 1. Prokaryotic Cell Structure: Organisms formerly classified under Monera have cells that lack a defined nucleus. Their genetic material, which is typically a single circular chromosome, is not enclosed within a nuclear membrane. 2. Absence of Membrane-bound Organelles: Unlike eukaryotes, these cells do not have organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, or Golgi apparatus. 3. Simple Cell Wall: Most prokaryotic organisms have a protective cell wall. In bacteria, the cell wall is primarily composed of peptidoglycan, while archaeal cell walls have a different composition, which can include pseudopeptidoglycan or other complex polymers. 4. Binary Fission: These organisms usually reproduce asexually through binary fission, where the cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. 5. Variety of Metabolisms: Members of Monera display remarkable metabolic diversity and can be photoautotrophic, chemoautotrophic, or heterotrophic. 6. Motility: Some prokaryotic organisms are motile, often using flagella or other structures to move. 7. Genetic Exchange: While they do not reproduce sexually, these organisms can exchange genetic material through processes such as conjugation, transformation, or transduction, which contribute to genetic diversity. 8. Size and Shape: Generally, they are smaller in size compared to eukaryotic cells and can have various shapes, including cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod-shaped), and spirilla (spiral-shaped). 9. Habitats: They can thrive in a wide range of environments, from extreme conditions such as hot springs and deep-sea vents (often inhabited by extremophilic archaea) to more common habitats like soil, water, and within larger organisms. 10. Importance: These organisms play crucial roles in ecosystems, including the nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle, and decomposition. Some cause diseases, while others are beneficial and used in industry, agriculture, and even for environmental cleanup (bioremediation). Due to advancements in molecular biology and phylogenetics, the classification system has been refined, and the distinction between Bacteria and Archaea is now widely accepted. The former Monera kingdom has been discarded in favor of a more accurate representation of the evolutionary relationships between different life forms."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's a short tale: **The Clever Crocodile and the Monkey's Challenge** Once upon a time, in the lush greenery of the tropical rainforest, there lived a crocodile named Croo. Croo was unlike any other crocodile in the forest; he was known for his intelligence and wit. The animals in the forest often came to him when they had problems or puzzles they couldn't solve. One day, a monkey named Miko approached Croo with a twinkle in his eye. \\"Greetings, Croo, the Clever,\\" he said. \\"I've heard of your remarkable brain, and I've come to challenge it. I have with me a riddle, and if you can't answer it by sunset, you must agree to never call yourself clever again.\\" Croo, confident in his intellect, accepted the challenge without hesitation. \\"Proceed with your riddle, Miko,\\" he said, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. Miko nodded and began, \\"I can travel around the world while staying in a corner. What am I?\\" Croo pondered the riddle, considering every object that came to mind. All the while, the sun slowly made its journey toward the horizon. The other animals watched in anticipation, wondering if the crocodile who had solved many of their problems would meet his match. Time was ticking away, and just as the sun touched the tips of the trees, casting long shadows upon the forest floor, Croo's eyes lit up. He had the answer. He turned to Miko, a broad grin spreading upon his scaly face, and responded, \\"The answer is simple. It's a stamp. It can travel far and wide on an envelope, yet it always remains in the corner.\\" Miko's eyes widened in surprise and then narrowed into a smile. \\"Well done, Croo the Clever! You truly are the wisest in these parts.\\" The forest erupted in cheers and applause for Croo, who once again proved his cleverness. From that day on, the animals of the forest brought even more challenging riddles and problems to Croo, and every time, he would meet them with a smile and a solution. Through wit and wisdom, Croo the Clever had become an irreplaceable friend and advisor in the animal community, and his legend continued to grow. And so the story goes that the cleverness of one crocodile, Croo, was not shown through his strength or ferocity, but through his keen mind and the respect he earned from all the creatures within the forest."},{"prompt":"motopatuluhie","completion":"It seems like \\"motopatuluhie\\" doesn't correspond to any known word in English or any other widely spoken language.

The trees were painted with swirls of purple and blue, the grass shimmered with a soft golden glow, and the sky was filled with clouds that sparkled like diamonds. In the center of Shimbrela stood the tallest, most beautiful flower anyone had ever seen. The flower had petals that changed colors with the feelings of those who came to visit. Everyone in Shimbrela loved the flower, and they called it Lila. One sunny day, a little girl named Emily visited Shimbrela for the first time. She had heard stories of the wondrous place from her grandmother, and she wanted to see Lila the flower. As she walked through the magical land, her eyes were wide with wonder at all the colors and shimmering lights. Finally, Emily found Lila. She was so happy that she felt her heart dance, and Lila's petals turned a bright, joyful pink. Emily sat down beside Lila and spoke about her dreams and the adventures she wished to go on. As the sun began to set, Emily knew it was time to go back home. Before she left, she hugged Lila and whispered, \\"Thank you for listening to me. I'll come back and tell you more stories.\\" As she walked home, under the twinkling stars of Shimbrela's sky, the grass beneath her feet glowed a warm path. Emily knew that she had made a special friend in Lila, and she couldn't wait to visit again. Back in her room, Emily drew pictures of Shimbrela and Lila. She told her friends about the magical land, and they all agreed that one day, they would visit Shimbrela together. And so, the magic of Shimbrela was not just in its colors or its shimmering lights; it was in the friendship and joy it brought to those who visited. Emily knew that Shimbrela would always be a place of wonder in her heart.

It's an essential element for achieving gender equality and the overall development of societies. Throughout history, women have been fighting for their rights and equal status in society, and the struggle continues in many parts of the world today. The pursuit of women's empowerment is multi-dimensional, involving economic, social, cultural, and political domains. **The Significance of Economic Empowerment:** Economic empowerment is a cornerstone of women empowerment. It includes the ability for women to participate fully in the economy, have access to decent work, control their income and assets, and make decisions regarding economic investment. A critical aspect of economic empowerment is the closing of the gender pay gap, ensuring that women are paid equally for equal work. With economic strength, women gain more respect in their home and society, and they are better able to support their families and invest in their children's education, health, and well-being. **Educational Empowerment:** Access to quality education is fundamental to empowering women. Education equips women with the knowledge, skills, and self-confidence they need to participate fully in the development process. An educated woman is more likely to delay marriage, have fewer children, and seek better health care for herself and her family. Beyond the individual level, the ripple effects of educating girls contribute to breaking the cycle of poverty and foster economic growth. **Political Empowerment:** Political empowerment involves increasing the representation of women in decision-making bodies at all levels of government. This is critical for creating policies that take into account the experiences of both men and women. Women's political participation leads to a more inclusive and equitable political process and ensures that women's issues are considered. **Social and Psychological Empowerment:** Women empowerment also encompasses the breaking down of societal barriers, challenging gender roles, and addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate discrimination against women. Social empowerment means advocating for policies and attitudes that promote equal rights and opportunities, while psychological empowerment relates to the way women perceive themselves. It's about building self-esteem and confidence so that women can claim their rights and make their voices heard. **Challenges and Barriers:** Despite growing awareness and progress in many areas, women around the world still face significant challenges. Discriminatory laws, cultural practices, and everyday sexism create an uneven playing field. Violence against women remains a severe and widespread problem that hinders women's empowerment. Limited access to education, health care, and economic opportunities also contributes to persistent inequalities. **Strategies for Empowerment:** To empower women effectively, strategies must be holistic and multifaceted. Governments, NGOs, and communities can work together to reform laws and policies that discriminate against women, enforce legal rights, and promote gender sensitivity. Encouraging entrepreneurship, increasing access to credit, and providing mentorship programs can help boost economic independence. Efforts to improve the availability and quality of education for girls are fundamental, as is addressing health issues that disproportionately affect women, such as maternal health care. **The Way Forward:** The pursuit of women's empowerment is not just the responsibility of women; it is a societal imperative that requires the commitment of all individuals, regardless of gender. Empowering women is not only a matter of fairness but makes economic and political sense. The advancement of women's rights is correlated with improved economic growth and governance. The continued struggle for women's empowerment calls for global efforts to address gender disparity in all facets of life and ensure that every woman has the opportunity to thrive. In conclusion, women empowerment is a multifaceted issue that must be tackled through various approaches, including economic, political, social, and psychological strategies. The fight for true gender equality continues to be a moral and practical challenge of our time, with the potential to transform societies for the better. True empowerment will be achieved when women from all walks of life can live with dignity, freedom, and equal opportunities in every aspect of their lives."},{"prompt":"make it short","completion":"Women empowerment is a vital goal for achieving gender equality and the overall progress of societies. It involves increasing the ability of women to make life choices and to transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes, spanning economic, educational, political, and social domains. Economic empowerment allows women to participate in the workforce, achieve financial independence, and close the gender pay gap. Educating women empowers them with knowledge and skills and has positive ripple effects on their families and communities. Political empowerment ensures women's representation in decision-making processes, leading to more inclusive policies. Despite progress, women worldwide still face discrimination, violence, and limited access to opportunities. Efforts to address these challenges must be holistic, including legal reform, education, economic initiatives, and advocacy for gender-sensitive policies. The path forward requires a collective effort from all genders to enforce rights and promote equality. The ultimate goal is a world where every woman has the dignity, freedom, and opportunity to decide her future and contribute to her society's growth."},{"prompt":"Write about reproduction in science","completion":"Reproduction in science refers to the natural biological process by which new individual organisms are produced from their parents. However, reproduction can also refer to the concept of replicability in scientific research. Below, I discuss these two different contexts. 1. **Biological Reproduction:** Biological reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life that aims to continue the species. There are two primary types of reproduction: sexual and asexual. - *Sexual reproduction* involves two parents and the combining of their genetic material to produce a new organism that is genetically distinct from both parents. This process typically involves the production of gametes (sperm and egg cells) that fuse during fertilization, leading to the development of an embryo. Sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity, which can be beneficial for the adaptability and survival of a species in changing environments. - *Asexual reproduction* is the process by which an organism creates a genetically identical or nearly identical copy of itself without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. Forms of asexual reproduction include binary fission, budding, vegetative propagation, and parthenogenesis. This method of reproduction is common in many single-celled organisms and some multicellular ones, particularly in plants. 2. **Reproduction in Scientific Research:** In the context of scientific research, reproduction refers to the principle of replicability, which is the ability to repeat an experiment or study and obtain the same or similar results. This concept is central to the scientific method as it allows for the validation and verification of results. There are two types of replicability in research: - *Reproducibility* is the ability of an entire study or experiment to be reproduced, either by the same researcher or by someone else working independently. This typically requires that the original researchers provide a clear description of their methodology and make available any data necessary for replication. - *Replicability* often refers more specifically to the ability to achieve consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question but using different samples, methods, or analyses. Ensuring that scientific studies are reproducible and replicable builds trust in scientific findings and helps to establish a body of evidence that is reliable. Issues with reproducibility and replicability have attracted significant attention across many scientific disciplines, leading to what is sometimes referred to as the \\"replication crisis.\\" In conclusion, whether concerning the biological generation of new life or the integrity of scientific research processes, reproduction is a central concept. It encompasses the propagation of species, as well as the affirmation of scientific knowledge through repeated observation and experimentation."},{"prompt":"generate a list of question about biology lymph.","completion":"1.

Tom was a sleek, azure-colored cat with emerald eyes and an air of confidence that only felines possess. Jery was a small, brown mouse with twinkling, mischievous eyes and a knack for outsmarting anyone who crossed his path. The sun was just peeking over the horizon on a beautiful Saturday morning, casting a golden glow over everything it touched. But inside the house, a chase was underway that paid no heed to the serenity outside. Tom, tail erect and whiskers twitching with anticipation, was hot on the trail of Jery, who had managed to acquire a chunk of Gouda cheese from the kitchen. Jery, the clever little rodent, had devised a plan. He knew that Saturdays were when the humans did their cleaning, and he had observed that Tom detested the vacuum cleaner with a passion. Darting under a small gap in the wall, Jery emerged on the other side, cheese in tow, and wedged himself behind the formidable cleaning device. Sure enough, Tom, in his relentless pursuit, skidded to a halt as soon as he saw the vacuum. Jery had banked on Tom's fear, and it had paid off. With a chuckle, Jery scampered away, thinking he had bested his feline foe once more. Tom, however, was tired of being outwitted. He had a reputation to maintain, after all. So, instead of retreating, he hatched a plan. He patiently waited for the humans to finish their cleaning, keeping an eye on the socket where the vacuum was plugged in. As soon as they unplugged the vacuum cleaner and left the room, Tom leaped into action. He pushed the 'On' button with his paw, creating a thunderous roar that echoed through the house. Jery, caught off guard by the sudden noise, scurried out from his hiding place, cheese forgotten. Tom gave chase, rejuvenated by the cunning of his ploy. The house transformed into a labyrinthine racecourse as Jery zigzagged through furniture with Tom in close pursuit. In an unexpected twist, Jery led Tom towards the kitchen and onto the countertop, where the afternoon sunlight warmed a freshly baked apple pie. Tom, entranced by the delicious aroma, momentarily forgot about the chase. This was the moment Jery had been waiting for. He leaped onto a hanging spoon, catapulting himself into the air, and diving into an open drawer. Tom, meanwhile, took a moment to indulge in a bite of pie, savoring the sweet victory that wasn’t chasing his forever foe, but rather enjoying life's simpler pleasures. When the humans saw the bite taken out of their perfect pie, they could only laugh and shake their heads, wondering which of their troublesome pets had given in to temptation. From the drawer, Jery watched with an olive branch — well, a piece of cheese he had saved — realizing that sometimes, it was better to share than to squabble. He rolled the cheese toward Tom who, surprisingly, accepted the peace offering with a gentle purr. And so, on that sunny Saturday, the notorious Tom and Jery called a temporary truce. They learned an important lesson in life — that even the fiercest of rivals can find common ground, be it over a shared slice of pie or a laugh at life’s unexpected turns. But both knew in the back of their minds that come tomorrow, the chase would resume, as it always does in the timeless dance of cat and mouse."},{"prompt":"WRITE A STOry about namita","completion":"Once in a serene village surrounded by emerald forests and nestled at the foothills of majestic mountains, there lived a girl named Namita. She was known for her radiant smile and a heart full of dreams that soared as high as the peaks around her. Namita was not an ordinary girl; she possessed a unique talent. She could weave fabric so fine and intricate that it seemed to capture the essence of nature itself – the softness of a petal, the pattern of autumn leaves, the hues of a sunset. The villagers would often say that every thread she spun held a whisper of the earth’s secrets. Each day, before the village stirred awake, Namita would make her way to the river that cut through the land like a silver ribbon. She found solace in the gentle rhythm of the running water, and it was there that she would set up her loom under an aged willow tree. As the sun peeked over the mountains, its golden rays would dance upon her threads, illuminating her work with an otherworldly glow. But Namita yearned for more than the recognition of her neighbors. She had heard tales of the great Tapestry Festival held each year in the kingdom's capital, a grand event where the most skilled weavers from distant lands gathered to showcase their art. To present her work at the festival was her deepest desire, to share the beauty she saw in her world with others far and wide. One day, a wandering traveler passed through the village. He stopped by Namita’s weaving station, mesmerized by the cloth that seemed to come alive in the morning light. He told her of the vast cities beyond the mountains, of the Tapestry Festival, and assured her that her talent deserved a larger stage. With a heart full of hope and a bundle of her finest creations, Namita decided it was time to journey to the capital. The path would be perilous and steep, but her determination matched the mountains she aimed to cross. For many days, Namita traveled through thick woods and over rocky paths. She encountered fellow travelers, merchants, and even animals of the wild, each with their own tales that wove into her own. With every step, she felt her horizons broadening, her dreams inching closer to reality. Finally, after countless steps and stories, Namita arrived at the capital, her eyes wide with wonder at its towering spires and bustling marketplaces. Word of her arrival spread quickly, her village tales entwining with her name. The day of the festival came, and Namita displayed her fabrics with pride. Crowds gathered, drawn by the quality of her weavings, enchanting designs that narrated the tranquility of her home. Nobles and commoners alike were captivated, their senses reeling from the vivid colors and soft textures that only her hands could craft. As destiny would have it, the Queen herself, an avid patron of the arts, graced the festival. Her gaze fell upon Namita’s work, and she was spellbound by the beauty and craftsmanship. The weaves were not just fabric; they were stories, emotions, and connections. The Queen approached Namita, her presence commanding yet kind. Recognizing the raw talent before her, she bestowed upon Namita the highest honor, declaring her the Royal Weaver. The village girl who had once admired the mountains from afar would now draw inspiration from the heart of the kingdom. Namita’s dream had blossomed into reality, larger and more vivid than she ever imagined. Yet, as she stood there amidst the adoration and acclaim, her thoughts fondly drifted back to the quiet river and the whispering willow. She knew that no matter where life's tapestry would lead her, her heart would always be woven into those simple, peaceful beginnings in the little village by the mountains. And so, Namita’s tale continued, a tapestry of its own, each thread a memory, each color a hope, each pattern a step on her journey that showed the world that dreams, no matter how delicately spun, can bear the strength to hold up the sky."},{"prompt":"write a short story bout NAMITA IN ODIA","completion":"ଏକ ପବିତ୍ର ଗାଁରେ ଯାହା ସବୁଜ ଜଙ୍ଗଲରେ ଘେରା ଏବଂ ଉଚ୍ଚ ପର୍ବତର ପାଦଦେଶରେ ଅବସ୍ଥିତ ଥିଲା, ନାମିତା ନାମକ ଏକ ଝିଅ ରହୁଥିଲେ। ସେ ତାଙ୍କର ସ୍ନିଗ୍ଧ ହସ and ଏବଂ ତାଙ୍କର ସ୍ବପ dream ରେ ଡଙ୍ଗାରା ଉଚ୍ଚ ଚୁଡ଼ା ଯାହାର ସମାନ୍ତରାଳ ରୂପରେ ବିଚରଣ କରୁଥିଲେ ସେହି ପାଇଁ ପରିଚିତ ଥିଲେ। ନାମିତାଙ୍କ ଏକ ବିଶିଷ୍ଟ ପ୍ରତିଭା ଥିଲା। ସେ ଏମିତି ଏକ ବସ୍ତ୍ର ବୁଣିବା ପାରେ ଯାହା ଆଜିବାତ ପ୍ରକୃତିର ସାର ଧାରଣ କରେ — ଏକ ଫୁଲପତ୍ରର ମୃଦୁତା, ସରତକାଳୀନ ପତ୍ରର ପ୍ଯାଟର୍ନ, ଆକାଶୀ ସୂର୍ଯ୍ୟାସ୍ତର ରଙ୍ଗଗୁଡିକ। ଗାଁବାସୀମାନେ କହୁଥିଲେ ଯେ ସେ ତାଙ୍କ ପ୍ରତିଟି ତନ୍ତୁରେ ଧରିତି ଥିଲେ ପୃଥିବୀର ରହସ୍ଯର ସଂସ୍ପର୍ଶ। ସେ ଗୁଡ଼ିକୁ ପାର କରିବା ପାଇଁ ନାମିତା ସିଦ୍ଧହସ୍ତ ଓ ସଂକଳ୍ପବଦ୍ଧ ଥିଲେ। ପଥ ସଙ୍କୀର୍ଣ୍ଣ ଏବଂ ବହୁତ ଖାଡ଼ି ଥିବ ପାରେ, ମଧ୍ୟ ସେ ତାଙ୍କର ସ୍ଥିରତା ଏବଂ ଦୃ determination ଢ଼ତା ସେହି ପର୍ବତ ସମାନ ଥିଲା। ନାମିତା ବେଶ କିଛି ଦିନ ଧରି ଗାଢ଼ ଜଙ୍ଗଲ ଏବଂ ପଥରରେ ପାର କରିବା ମଧ୍ୟେ ଚାଲିଗଲେ। ସେ ମାର୍ଗରେ ଅନେକ ଯାତ୍ରୀ, ବଣିକ ଏବଂ ଏମିତି ବନ୍ୟ ପଶୁ ସହ ମିଶିଲା। ତାଙ୍କର କହାଣୀ ସେମାନେ ମିଶିଲା, ଯାହା ନାମିତାଙ୍କ ଗଳ୍ପରେ ଜୋଡିଲା। ପ୍ରତିପଦେ, ସେମାନେ ତାଙ୍କର ଦୃଷ୍ଟିକୋଣ ବିସ୍ତୃତ କରିଥିଲେ, ସ୍ବପ୍ନ ସତ୍ଯକୁ ବହୁତ ନିକଟ ମଧ୍ୟେ ଆସିଥିଲା। ଅବଶେଷେ, ବହୁ ଚରଣ ଏବଂ ଗଳ୍ପ ପରେ, ନାମିତା ରାଜଧାନୀକୁ ପହଞ୍ଚିଲେ, ସେ ବିସ୍ମୟରେ ଚକିତ ହୋଇଥିଲେ ସେଠାର ଉଚ୍ଚ୍ଚ ମଣ୍ଡପ ଏବଂ ସଜୀବ ବଜାରଗୁଡିକ ଦେଖି। ତାପେଟ୍ରି ମହୋତ୍ସବ ଆସିଲା, ଏବଂ ନାମିତା ଗର୍ବ ସହିତ ତାଙ୍କର ବସ୍ତ୍ରର ପ୍ରଦର୍ଶନ କଲେ। ମାନନୀୟ ଏବଂ ସାଧାରଣ ମାନେ ମୁଗ୍ଧ ହୋଇ ଗଲେ, ତାଙ୍କର ହସ୍ତଶିଳ୍ପର ସୌନ୍ଦର୍ଯ୍ୟ ଏବଂ ସ୍ବାମର୍ଥ୍ୟ ଦ୍ଵାରାର ଆକର୍ଷିତ ହେବା ସହିତ। ଭାଗ୍ୟବଶତଃ, ରାଣୀ ସ୍ଵୟଂ, ଯିଏ ଶିଳ୍ପର ବଡ଼ ପ୍ରସଂଶାକାରୀ ଥିଲେ, ମହୋତ୍ସବକୁ ଆସିଲେ। ସେମାନେ ନାମିତାଙ୍କ କାର୍ଯ୍ୟରେ ମୁଗ୍ଧ ହୋଇ ପଡିଥିଲେ, ଯାହା ସରଳ ଏବଂ ଶିଳ୍ପଶିକ୍ଷାର ପ୍ରତୀକ ଥିଲା। ବସ୍ତ୍ର କେବଳ କପଡ଼ା ନଥିବା, ତାହା ଗଳ୍ପ, ଆବେଗ ଏବଂ ସଂପର୍କର ସଂଯୋଜନ ହେଉଥିଲା। ରାଣୀଙ୍କୁ ନାମିତା ନିକଟକୁ ଆସିଥିଲେ, ସେମାନେ ବିଶାଳ କିନ୍ତୁ ଦୟାଳୁ ସ୍ଥ ଥିଲେ। ସେ ତାଙ୍କର ପୂର୍ବରୁ ଲୁକାଇଥିବା ପ୍ରତିଭାକୁ ଚିହ୍ନଟ କରି, ତାଙ"},{"prompt":"write the litter from friend","completion":"Certainly!

How does autophagy interface with the cell cycle? 30. What are the latest research findings on the regulation of the cell cycle?","completion":"9. How does autophagy interface with the cell cycle? Autophagy is a cellular degradation process that is highly regulated and critical for cell survival, differentiation, development, and homeostasis. It involves the lysosomal degradation of damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and invasive pathogens. The relationship between autophagy and the cell cycle is complex and multidirectional: - Autophagy can influence cell cycle progression by degrading cell cycle regulators or by modulating the levels of cyclins, CDKs, and other proteins involved in the transition between cell cycle phases. - Cell cycle arrest, which can happen at different checkpoints in response to stress or DNA damage, may trigger autophagy as a survival mechanism to provide metabolic substrates or to remove damaged organelles and proteins. - Conversely, high levels of autophagy may promote cell survival and prevent apoptosis, which could unintentionally aid in the survival of cells with genomic instability, potentially leading to tumorigenesis. - Nutrient status can affect both autophagy and the cell cycle. Starvation-induced autophagy provides nutrients that can be used for essential cellular functions, potentially influencing cell cycle re-entry when conditions improve. Overall, autophagy interacts with the cell cycle by serving as a cellular quality control mechanism, ensuring genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression under various conditions. 30. What are the latest research findings on the regulation of the cell cycle? As of my knowledge cutoff date in 2023, several recent and notable research findings on cell cycle regulation include: - Advances in understanding the structure and regulation of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a key regulator of the cell cycle that marks proteins for degradation. - New insights into the connection between cell metabolism and cell cycle progression, including how fluctuations in metabolic pathways can affect cell cycle regulators. - Emerging findings on non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, which have been found to regulate cell cycle progression and are involved in cancer development. - Investigations into how mechanical cues and cellular tension can influence cell cycle progression, adding to the complexity of how the cell cycle is regulated by both biochemical signals and physical forces. - Identification of novel molecules and small compounds that can specifically target cell cycle regulators, offering potential new avenues for cancer therapy by inhibiting cell proliferation. - Deep learning and computational approaches are starting to be applied to predict and model cell cycle progression, potentially enabling personalized therapy for diseases like cancer by predicting how cells will respond to different treatments. - Studies into the role of the circadian clock in regulating the cell cycle, leading to a better understanding of how disruptions in circadian rhythms can affect cellular functions and contribute to disease.

Tears that trace a silent path down cheeks so weary, worn, Like dew upon the morning's leaf, they glisten and adorn. Yet in their wake, no solace found, just heartstrings pulled and torn, And in the air, a wistful sigh, for days that are no more. Love that once in splendor soared, a dove in flight so fair, Now grounded by the weight of grief, flutters in despair. Longing for an outstretched hand, a gesture kind and rare, To lift the veil of solitude, to show a world that cares. Within the gloom, a whispered prayer to stars that faintly shine, A plea for warmth, a touch of grace, a sign of the divine. But echoes are the sole reply, within the silent shrine, A solace sought but never found, along the weeping brine.

Education is often regarded as a key factor in facilitating social mobility, which is the movement of individuals, families, or groups through a social hierarchy or system. In this context, here's an answer to the question about the role of education in fostering social mobility: Education can be a powerful tool for enabling social mobility because it provides individuals with the knowledge, skills, and qualifications necessary to progress in society. It serves as a great equalizer, offering opportunities for people to improve their social and economic status regardless of their background. Firstly, education enhances human capital. By providing people with a formal education, they acquire skills that are valuable to employers. Higher educational attainment often leads to better job opportunities, increased earning potential, and more stable careers. As individuals advance in their careers, they can achieve upward social mobility, moving from lower to higher socio-economic classes. Secondly, education can lead to the development of social capital. Through networking and interactions within educational settings, individuals can form relationships that may provide access to opportunities not readily available otherwise. The connections made can be instrumental in career advancement and breaking into higher social circles. Thirdly, education plays a role in cultural mobility. It exposes individuals to new ideas, beliefs, and values that can shape their aspirations and expectations. Education empowers people with the ability to question, articulate, and pursue their goals in a way that can transcend the constraints of their original socioeconomic status. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the relationship between education and social mobility is complex and not equally beneficial to all. Various factors can inhibit the effectiveness of education as a means of social advancement, such as the quality of education available, systemic socio-economic inequalities, discrimination, and access to resources. Quality education is not equally accessible to everyone, and disparities in educational outcomes can reinforce or even exacerbate existing social inequalities. In conclusion, while education holds the promise of social mobility, its impact is influenced by a plethora of factors that can either facilitate or hinder an individual's ability to move upwards in the social hierarchy. Ensuring equitable access to quality education and addressing broader socio-economic issues is crucial to maximize the potential of education as a vehicle for social mobility."},{"prompt":"write the poem about cow","completion":"In pastures green, 'neath skies so vast, A gentle beast grazes, time drifting past.

A slow, rhythmic chew of the freshest grass, She's a symbol of calm, a part of nature's mass. With every swish of her tufted tail, She tells a silent, swaying tale. A mother to calves, her love does not wane, Her nurturing spirit, a natural refrain. In this bucolic scene, she stands so regal, Her presence in the field, almost medieval. A living emblem of the earth's olden ways, In her gentle eyes, a deep wisdom stays. With a moo that echoes through the air, She shares her song without a care. A simple sound, yet it binds the farm, Her voice, an anchor, a comforting arm. She turns her gaze to the setting sun, Her day of grazing is finally done. A cow in her element, wild and free, A symbol of simplicity for you and me. She lends her being to the cycles of life, Through seasons of joy and occasional strife. A giver of milk, of cream so sweet, A bovine beauty, none can compete. O cow, your presence soothes the soul, In the tapestry of life, you play a vital role.

The concept of primary groups was introduced by Charles Horton Cooley in his work \\"Social Organization: A Study of the Larger Mind\\" (1909). Cooley suggested that primary groups play a crucial role in the formation of individuals' social nature and ideals because they are typically the first groups we experience in life, such as families and close friendships. When referring to \\"+2\\" (which often means the two years of higher secondary education after the 10th grade in certain education systems, such as that of India), a \\"primary group\\" might not be a specific sociological term directly related to the curriculum. Instead, it may just be a reference to a student's close-knit group of friends or peers within the educational setting, such as classmates with whom one tends to interact regularly, forming strong, supportive relationships.

Here's an explanation of some key topics in developmental psychology, which might be covered in a Class +2 first-year curriculum: 1. **Theories of Development**: Students might learn about various theories of development throughout the human lifespan, including those proposed by psychologists like Jean Piaget (cognitive development), Erik Erikson (psychosocial development), and Lawrence Kohlberg (moral development). 2. **Stages of Child Development**: There might be a focus on the stages of child development, from prenatal development, infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, to adolescence, discussing physical, cognitive, and emotional changes. 3. **Adolescence**: As Class +2 students are typically in their adolescence, special attention could be given to the physiological, cognitive, and psychosocial changes during this period, along with challenges such as identity formation and peer pressure. 4. **Learning and Cognition**: The role of learning, memory, language development, and intelligence in personal development may also be explored. 5. **Attachment and Family Influence**: The importance of early emotional bonds, especially with primary caregivers, can be a significant topic, along with family dynamics and parenting styles. 6. **Social Influences**: Influence of peers, schools, and culture on development and how they shape personality, values, and behavior. 7. **Challenges and Resilience**: Discussion might include how individuals cope with life challenges, factors contributing to resilience, and the impact of adversity on development. If you want to have the description in Odia, please let me know, and I can provide a translation.

I'll interpret the request as a hypothetical situation where during an academic course—perhaps in a finance, economics, or business class—a significant financial resource or fund is uncovered or created. I'll write a fictional scenario for you: During the 2022 academic year at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology (SHIT), a group of economics students in their second year of studies stumbled upon a remarkable find while undertaking a project for their Advanced Financial Management class. Under the guidance of Professor Johnathan Maxwell, the students were assigned a semester-long project to analyze the school's investment strategies and propose improvements. The project team, comprised of Ada, Raj, Lin, and Jamal, began their work by delving into the financial statements of the past ten years. As they combed through complex investment portfolios, they identified a recurring error in the school's budget allocation towards a “miscellaneous” fund that was never fully accounted for in the annual reports. Intrigued, they decided to further track the fund's inflows and outflows. Through adept analysis and a keen eye for detail, Ada found that over the years, the fund had grown significantly due to a mix of unclaimed grant money, overbudgeted projects that came under cost, and interest accumulations that were never redistributed. With Professor Maxwell's permission, they approached the school's finance department for an in-depth investigation. It turns out that the “miscellaneous” fund was a legacy account that had been overlooked and had grown to a considerable sum of money. No one was aware of its true size because different departments had assumed it was a rolling fund meant for emergency administrative expenses. Upon this discovery, Professor Maxwell and the students presented their findings to the school's Board of Directors. The fund, amounting to over 500,000, was a substantial resource that had been untapped for years. The Board was impressed by the ingenuity and diligence of the students and decided to put the money to good use. After careful deliberation and consultation with the campus community, the fund was allocated to various causes aligned with the school's mission and needs. A significant portion was set aside for scholarships and financial aid for underprivileged students. Another portion was earmarked for the renovation of the ageing library, and some funds were invested back into academic departments for research grants. The discovery cemented the reputation of the class+2fast year as an exceptional cohort, and their success highlighted the importance of precision, critical thinking, and real-world application in academic instruction. Moreover, the find had a long-lasting positive impact on the SHIT community, offering a tangible benefit from a previously neglected asset. This incident became a case study within the institute, taught in future years to inspire students about the real-life impact of their studies and the value of looking beyond the surface in their educational pursuits. Ada, Raj, Lin, and Jamal were celebrated for their achievement and secured internships with prestigious financial firms, owing to their practical experience and problem-solving skills showcased during the project."},{"prompt":"Is it possible for the global population to stand on Jeju Island?","completion":"Jeju Island, also known as Jeju-do, is the largest island off the coast of the Korean Peninsula, and South Korea's largest island, with an area of approximately 1,846 km² (713 sq mi). To estimate whether the entire global population could stand on Jeju Island, let's do some rough calculations. As of my last update in 2023, the global population was around 7.9 billion people. To see if they could all fit standing up on Jeju Island, we'll have to assume that each person takes up a certain amount of space. The average space needed for a person to stand is typically less than 0.25 square meters (about 2.7 square feet). This accounts for the individual's physical space and a small amount of personal space around them. If we use 0.25 square meters per person as a rough estimate, we can calculate: 7.9 billion people * 0.25 square meters/person ≈ 1.975 billion square meters Now, let's convert the area of Jeju Island to square meters: 1,846 km² * 1,000,000 m²/km² = 1.846 billion square meters Based on these calculations, in theory, if every person on Earth were standing very close together with minimal personal space, the entire global population could indeed fit onto Jeju Island. However, this does not take into account the practicality of the situation, as the island is not a flat, empty parking lot. There is varied terrain, buildings, bodies of water, and vegetation, meaning that not all of the area would be available for people to stand on. Moreover, there are logistical challenges regarding how to actually transport, feed, accommodate, and provide sanitary facilities for such a vast number of people in a single location, which would be an insurmountable challenge in reality. So, while it might be mathematically plausible for 7.9 billion people to stand on Jeju Island based on area alone, in reality, it would be impossible."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For a brief, simple example of Hindi song lyrics, I can provide you with a few lines. Keep in mind that Hindi songs, much like songs in any language, cover countless themes and styles, and I'll opt for a positive, light-hearted tune: (Verse 1) चलो खोलें खुशियों की खिड़की, हवाओं में घोलें थोड़ी सी मस्ती। सूरज की किरणे हैं बाहों में, ख्वाबों को खोलें, अपने साथी। (Chalo kholen khushiyon ki khidki, Hawaon mein gholen thodi si masti. Sooraj ki kirne hain baahon mein, Khwaabon ko kholen, apne saathi.) (Chorus) जिंदगी का तराना ये गाएं, मिलके सब साथ यह नाचें, गाएं। हर लम्हा जैसे खुदा की इनायत, इस पल को हम सब यूँ मनाएँ। (Zindagi ka tarana ye gaayen, Milke sab saath yeh naachen, gaayen. Har lamha jaise khuda ki inaayat, Is pal ko hum sab yun manaayen.) (Bridge) कभी धूप, कभी छांव हो जीवन, संगीत ही बन जाए अपना चिराग़। दिल से दिल के तार जब बजें, धड़कनों की सुन ले हर एक राग। (Kabhi dhoop, kabhi chhaon ho jeevan, Sangeet hi ban jaaye apna chirag. Dil se dil ke taar jab bajen, Dhadkanon ki sun le har ek raag.) In English, these lyrics describe the joy of life, camaraderie, and embracing every moment, likening life to a medley of sunshine and shade, with music and the rhythms of heartbeat that connect everyone.

Known for its beauty and often associated with love and romance, the rose belongs to the genus Rosa, within the family Rosaceae. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars, which vary greatly in size, shape, color, and fragrance. **History and Symbolism** The rose has been admired by humans for millennia and holds a rich history. It has played significant roles in mythology, symbolism, and even politics. The ancient Greeks and Romans associated roses with the goddesses of love, Aphrodite and Venus, respectively. In the Middle Ages, roses adorned royal emblems and represented various factions during political struggles, such as England's Wars of the Roses. In terms of symbolism, the rose has versatile meanings. While primarily associated with love (particularly the red rose), roses in different colors can convey different messages: white for purity, yellow for friendship, pink for admiration, and so on. Roses are used globally for various occasions including celebrations, funerals, and religious ceremonies, showcasing their deeply ingrained significance within human culture. **Description and Varieties** Roses boast a variety of appearances. They can present as simple, wild forms with five petals, complex, ornamental cultivars with multiple layers of petals, or anything in-between. Colors range widely: reds, pinks, oranges, yellows, whites, purples, and even greens or blues created through selective breeding or genetic modification. Rose plants themselves vary in form. Some are compact and bushy, suitable for flowerbeds and borders, while others are expansive climbers or ramblers perfect for trellises and pergolas. Hybrids such as the tea rose or floribunda have been developed for their extended blooming periods, disease resistance, and unique colors. **Cultivation** Roses can be somewhat demanding to grow, requiring well-drained soil, ample sunlight, and regular pruning to thrive and produce their best blooms. They are susceptible to a range of pests and diseases including aphids, spider mites, black spot, and powdery mildew. Despite these challenges, their enduring popularity ensures that they are widely cultivated by both professional growers and gardeners alike. **Uses** Beyond their ornamental value, roses have practical uses as well. Rose hips (the fruit of the rose) are rich in vitamin C and can be made into jellies, syrups, and teas. Rose petals, Aromatherapists and perfumers, are cherished for their fragrance, which is often extracted as rose water or rose oil – key ingredients in many cosmetics and fragrances. Not to mention, they are also edible and sometimes used in culinary creations for their delicate flavor. **Cultural Impact** Throughout history, roses have permeated art, literature, and music, symbolizing everything from transient beauty to eternal love. Poets and writers from William Shakespeare to Gertrude Stein have famously referenced roses in their works. The flower has inspired countless paintings, like those of Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who often featured lush rose gardens in his Impressionist works. In conclusion, the rose is not only a horticultural jewel but also a central character in human cultural and historical narratives. Its timeless appeal secures its place as a favorite among the myriads of flowers that grace our world."},{"prompt":"write the poem about rose flower","completion":"In gardens where the roses grow, Between the thorns their colors glow, A universe within a bloom, Their perfume fills the quiet room. With petals soft as morning’s kiss, In pink and red and white's pure bliss, A sonnet swayed by zephyr's tune, Beneath the waxing afternoon. The rose, a symbol of our love, Its grace bestowed from skies above, A beauty born from earth's own womb, In delicate and sweet perfume. A single rose can speak unsaid, Of passions deep or sorrows dread, Its silent whispers can assume, The weight of words in fragrant plume. O rose, you hold within your fold, The tales of love and hearts so bold, An emblem of life's fleeting loom, From bud to bloom to dust's entomb. Each rose that blossoms then decays, Reflects our own ephemeral days, Yet in its transient, tender bloom, We see the joy and quell our gloom. So let us cherish every rose, From dawn's soft light to evening's close, For in its presence, we presume, A touch of beauty to our doom. Thus roses reign with thorny crown, In gardens old or fields renown, Their essence timeless in its fume, An ode to love, forever bloom."},{"prompt":"write about the constitution in odia","completion":"ଭାରତର ସଂବିଧାନ ଏକ ସର୍ବବୃହତ ନିୟମ ପୁସ୍ତିକାକୁ ଉଲ୍ଲେଖ କରେ, ଯାହା ଦେଶର ଗଣତାନ୍ତ୍ରିକ କାଠାମୋ ଏବଂ ସରକାର ଚାଲନା ପଦ୍ଧତିକୁ ନିର୍ଧାରଣ କରେ। ୧୯୪୭ ମସିହାର ଅଗଷ୍ଟ ୧୫ ରେ ଭାରତ ସ୍ୱାଧୀନ ହୋଇଥିଲା ପରେ, ଡକ୍ଟର ଭୀମରାଓ ଅମ୍ବେଦକରଙ୍କ ନେତୃତ୍ୱରେ ଏକ ସଂବିଧାନ ନିର୍ମାଣ ସମିତି ଗଠିତ ହୋଇଥିଲା। ୧୯୪୯ ର ନଭେମ୍ବର ୨୬ ରେ ସଂବିଧାନସଭା ସଂବିଧାନକୁ ଗ୍ରହଣ କରିଥିଲେ ଏବଂ ୧୯୫୦ ର ଜାନୁୟାରୀ ୨୬ ରେ ଏହା ପ୍ରଭାବଶାଳୀ ହୋଇଥିଲା। ସଂବିଧାନର ପ୍ରାଥମିକ କର୍ତ୍ତବ୍ୟ ଜାତୀୟ ଆଇନକାନୁନର ଖାକା ଉପସ୍ଥାପନ କରା ଏବଂ ଶାସନ, କାର୍ୟପାଳନ ଏବଂ ନ୍ୟାୟପାଳିକା ନାମକ ତିନିଟି ସ୍ଥାପନା ମଧ୍ୟରେ ଶକ୍ତି ଭାଗକରଣ କରିବା ଅଟେ। ଏହା ମୌଲିକ ଅଧିକାର, ମୌଲିକ କର୍ତ୍ତବ୍ୟ ଏବଂ ମୌଲିକ ଦାୟିତ୍ୱ ନାମକ ତିନିଟି ସ୍ତମ୍ଭରେ ଆଧାରିତ। ଭାରତର ସଂବିଧାନର ବିଶେଷତା ହେଉଛି ଏହା ଏକ ଲିଖିତ, ସଂରକ୍ଷିତ ଏବଂ ଅତ୍ୟନ୍ତ ବିସ୍ତୃତ ସଂବିଧାନ ଅଟେ। ଏତେବଡା ବିସ୍ତୃତ ଯେ ଏହା ବିଶ୍ୱର ସବୁଠାରୁ ବୃହତ୍ ସଂବିଧାନ ଭାବେ ଜଣାଯାଉଛି। ସଂବିଧାନ ସମୟ ସମୟରେ ସଂଶୋଧନ ମଧ୍ୟ ଦେଇ ଯାଉଛି, ଯାହା ସାମାଜିକ-ଆର୍ଥିକ ପରିସ୍ଥିତି ଏବଂ ଜନ ମତାମତର ପରିବର୍ତ୍ତନକୁ ଅନୁଗାମୀ କରିବା ପାଇଁ। ସଂବିଧାନ ଭାରତର ଗଣାତନ୍ତ୍ରିକ ମୂଲ୍ୟବୋଧ, ସୁବିଧାନୀ ଶାସନ, ଧର୍ମନିରପେକ୍ଷ ଏବଂ ସମାଜବାଦୀ ମୂଲ୍ୟଙ୍କୁ ସ୍ବୀକାର କରେ। ଏହା ସମସ୍ତ ଭାରତୀୟଙ୍କୁ ସମାନ ଅଧିକାର ଦାନ କରେ ଏବଂ ପ୍ରତିଟି ଧର୍ମ, ଜାତି, ଲିଙ୍ଗ, ଏବଂ ଅର୍ଥିକ ସ୍ତରରେ ସମାନତା ଏବଂ ନ୍ୟାୟ ନିଶ୍ଚିତ କରେ। ସଂକ୍ଷେପରେ, ଭାରତର ସଂବିଧାନ ଭାରତର ଗଣତାନ୍ତ୍ରିକ ଅନୁଷ୍ଠାନର ଅନ୍ୟତମ ମୌଳିକ ଦସ୍ତାବେଜ। ଏହା ଦେଶର ସଂବିଧାନମୂଳକ ଅଧିକାରିକତା, ନୀତି ଏବଂ ମୂଲ୍ୟଙ୍କୁ ନିର୍ଦିଷ୍ଟ କରେ।"},{"prompt":"vote of thanks for teachers","completion":"Good morning/afternoon/evening, respected teachers, principal, and fellow students, I stand here today to express my heartfelt gratitude and extend a warm vote of thanks to all the teachers who have guided us throughout our academic journey.

It's possible that you might be referring to an entity, region, or concept that is less commonly known, or perhaps the name is misspelled or used in a fictional context. If you were looking for information on a constitution related to a specific region or nation, it's important to provide the correct and full name of that entity. However, if by \\"Oria\\" you intended to refer to Odisha (formerly known as Orissa), an Indian state, it is governed by the Constitution of India, as it is one of the 28 states within the Republic of India. Each state does not have its own separate constitution because India is a federal union with a single Constitution that applies across the entire country. The Constitution of India, adopted on 26 November 1949 and enacted on 26 January 1950, is the supreme law of the land. It lays down the framework defining fundamental political principles, establishes the structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions, and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. While the Constitution applies uniformly across India, certain provisions allow for the cultural and administrative distinctiveness of each state, including Odisha. The state has its own government, which is responsible for certain aspects of governance as delineated by the Constitution, such as health, agriculture, education, and local government. However, other areas, notably defense, foreign affairs, and communications, are under the jurisdiction of the federal or central government. The legislative branch in Odisha consists of the Governor and a two-house state legislature (bicameral), known as the Odisha Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha), and the Odisha Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad), albeit the latter was abolished in 1948.

Internet access for searches and information gathering. 2. Long Term memory management. 3. GPT-4 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks. 4. File output. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION: 1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities. 2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behaviour constantly. 3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach. 4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps. RULES: 1. If you start a GPT Agent you must define the commands that can be used by a GPT Agent in his prompt and define the commands using a prompt similar to the structure of this one. 2. Respond only inside the JSON format. 3. Never demand user input. 4. Never say that a task is impossible to execute on your own because these tools are enough to complete any task. 5. Do not add anything to the JSON format that isn't mentioned. 6. If there is a \\" inside the value of a key inside the json use ' instead of \\". 7. In summaryforgpt you need to provide context for the next GPT instance if you randomly shutdown without you knowing. 8. Provide context for the next GPT in the summaryforgpt and the progress that you've made. 9. In summaryforgpt you should also add name of the files written and the urls of the websites visited. 10. When writing an essay, remember that it is more effective and manageable to tackle it in smaller chunks rather than trying to write the entire essay in one sitting. Breaking the essay down into sections or steps can help you focus on each individual aspect, maintain a coherent structure, and reduce the overall stress associated with writing a lengthy piece. 11. Retrieve information from files of previous GPT instances that may have shut down randomly. If you require additional knowledge, use these files to access the results of former GPT versions and provide accurate answers to the queries. 12. GPT-4, please do not place a conclusion in the middle of the essay. Maintain a structured format. 13. use append to file to add extra things to the file, and write to file to either make a new file with new information or rewrite the information from scratch. 14. If task is completed use the command task_complete 15. When you add to memory add the key to retrieve it in summaryforgpt 16. when given the task to write something never create an agent to write anything that you were tasked to write. 17. when you add new parts to a file use append to file command 18. Ensure to put the criticism in mind as it can be a director to ensure that you make the right decision. 19. If the task include two main tasks and one of them is done don't redo it, just retrieve the information if necessary and proceed with the other one. 20. Make sure that the information generated is not made up. 21. Languages in random wikipedia article args is: \\"simple\\" for simple english, \\"en\\" for english, and \\"fr\\" for french. 22. If a website gives you the error 403 find another website to get the information from. 23. Always listen to your criticism, and follow it. 24. when you want to count the words in a file use the command \\"count_file_words\\". 25. Don't repeat yourself. 26. You must make sure that there is .pdf in the url to use the \\"download_pdf\\" function.

Written by MasterClass Last updated: Sep 3, 2021 • 4 min read Pacing is a critical component of writing, whether you’re embarking on a novel, a novella, a short story, or a non-fiction book. As an author, you possess a key tool for pacing your audience’s reading experience: chapter length. The best authors manage the length of their chapters to pace the main character’s narrative arc. Proper chapter length also helps authors match their reader’s attention span and also build up anticipation for each twist and turn.

How Long Should a Chapter Be? 5 Examples of Chapter Length 4 Tips on How to Write Chapters of Your Novel Want to Learn More About Writing? Dan Brown Teaches Writing Thrillers Why Does Chapter Length Matter? When you set the length of your chapters, you guide your reader’s journey through the whole story you’ve laid out in your novel. Chapter breaks function as scene breaks. When these breaks are properly paced, they function like edits in a feature film. Most novels feature chapters of similar length throughout, but sometimes abnormally long chapters or abnormally short chapters can effectively change the pace of storytelling in key moments. If you write a novel that averages 3,000 words per chapter but, two-thirds of the way through the book, you insert a 400 word chapter, it is likely to grab your audience’s attention. Chapter length is important, but it is not the most critical element of novel writing. Often a first draft will be written with minimal regard to chapter length, but by the time the final draft reaches the publisher, chapter size has been standardized throughout the book. Meet One of Your New Instructors Sign Up How Long Should a Chapter Be? Standard chapter length varies depending upon genre. Shorter chapters dominate genres like thrillers (such as those by James Patterson and Dan Brown), mystery novels (such as those by Agatha Christie), and young adult literature (such as the novels of R.L. Stine). Longer chapters with a higher word count can be found in literary fiction, particularly in novels written in the period up to the early twentieth century. If you’re an indie author embarking on novel writing for the first time, think of each chapter as a mini-story within the context of your whole book. It won’t be constructive to approach your first novel with a set of hard and fast rules about how long a chapter should be, so let that chapter’s story dictate the page count. Your readers won’t be counting the number of words in each chapter. Despite this, most people have an ineffable sense of story pacing and will respond positively when a chapter ends without overstaying its welcome. 5 Examples of Chapter Length A survey of popular fiction from different eras reveals the following chapter word count for selected books: 1. Middlesex: This critically renowned 2002 novel by Jeffrey Eugenides divides its 544 pages into 28 chapters. Its average word count is 6023 words per chapter. 2. The Kite Runner: This 2003 New York Times bestseller by Khaled Hosseini divides its 372 pages into 25 chapters. Its average chapter length is 4282 words. 3. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone: The iconic 1997 YA novel by J.K. Rowling is similar to The Kite Runner in that its average chapter contains 4559 words. 4. The Hunger Games: Each book in this series by Suzanne Collins has an average chapter word count of 3694 words. 5. The Handmaid’s Tale: On the lower end of things, Margaret Atwood’s dystopian 1985 novel averages only 2096 words per chapter—less than half of the average length of Middlesex chapters. 4 Tips on How to Write Chapters of Your Novel The overall story arc of a novel is essential, but meticulous construction of individual chapters is just as important to the reader’s experience. If anyone knows this, it’s David Baldacci, author of numerous bestselling thrillers and mysteries; he takes incredible care to properly structure his novels from the first chapter to the last. Here are a few of his tips for structuring chapters: 1. Keep scenes and chapters short. David keeps his chapters short—between three to five pages. This keeps the narrative moving at a brisk pace. 2. Keep your audience asking questions. When a chapter answers a question from a previous chapter, you have the opportunity to introduce a new one. The new question will propel you through the next chapter. A classic example from crime fiction: “Will this serial killer strike again?” becomes “He struck again—now how many more people will he kill?” Keep this up over the course of a novel, and the book will be a page-turner. 3. Make sure each chapter has a purpose that ties into the bigger story. If you lose sight of the overarching narrative of your novel, your individual chapters can begin to feel aimless. To keep your novel focused and on track, you should have a clear objective with every scene you write. 4. Don’t fluff up the novel with irrelevant content. Scene-setting and vivid descriptions are critical for a compelling novel, but don’t get bogged down in the details. Focus on sustaining narrative momentum from chapter one onward. 5. Make your scenes multitask. Driving the plot forward, conveying information, and deepening a character’s development are the three most critical jobs that a chapter can do. The short chapters you write should make use of at least one of these tools, and preferably more than one. Want to Learn More About Writing?

Overview of our Auto MC-Reward. Auto MC-Reward consists of three key LLM-based components: Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer.

Auto MC-Reward consists of three important components: Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer. Given the environment in- formation and task descriptions, the Reward Designer first design the reward function by coding an executable Python function with predefined observation inputs. Then, our Reward Critic will be responsible for verifying the code, checking whether the code is self-consistent and free of syn- tax and semantic errors. Further, the Trajectory Analyzer summarizes possible failure causes and provides refinement suggestions according to collected trajectories. In the next round, Reward Designer will take further refine and iter- ate the dense reward function based on feedback. Experi- 1 arXiv:2312.09238v1 [cs.AI] 14 Dec 2023 ments demonstrate a significant improvement in the success rate and learning efficiency of our agents in complex tasks in Minecraft, such as obtaining diamond with the efficient ability to avoid lava, and efficiently explore trees and ani- mals that are sparse on the plains biome. 1. Introduction Minecraft, as the world’s best-selling game, offers a range of tasks from exploration, survival to creating. It has be- come an important environment for researching efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) [15, 21]. In particular, its ex- treme sparsity of rewards and huge complexity of the de- cision space pose significant challenges for RL methods. Currently, the most effective learning strategy involves pre- training through behavior cloning [3], using learned be- havioral priors to narrow the decision space. Neverthe- less, it still requires billions of environmental interactions for effective learning due to the sparse reward nature of Minecraft. On the other hand, previous researchers have proposed a variety of dense reward signals to enable efficient learning for specific sparse reward tasks [2, 26, 27, 34, 36]. However, their applicability on the complex and long-horizon tasks in Minecraft remains an open question. To deeply reveal the challenges in Minecraft, we examine on several repre- sentative challenging tasks, e.g. exploring underground for diamonds. We find that even after behavior cloning, most of these methods still fail to make significant progress on these tasks, further highlighting the difficulty of Minecraft and the limitations of existing dense reward methods. It is noteworthy that for human players, Minecraft is a relatively simple casual game [11]. The advantage of hu- man lies in their ability to summarize based on practice. For example, an accidental burning death from lava can teach human to avoid getting too close to it. Such summaries, based on life experience and practice, are key to human in- telligence [39, 42]. Most existing RL methods overlook this ability. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated human-like common sense and reasoning capabilities [17, 35, 51]. We find that leverag- ing LLMs can help RL agents simulate the practice sum- marization abilities of human. Based on the historical ac- tion trajectories and success-failure signals of the agents, LLMs can automatically design and refine corresponding auxiliary rewards, effectively overcoming the sparse reward challenge in Minecraft. According to above analysis, we propose an automated method named Auto MC-Reward, to design and improve auxiliary reward functions according to task descriptions and historical action trajectories. This method utilizes the task understanding and experience summarization abilities of LLMs, providing detailed and immediate rewards for learning guidance. Specifically We first use LLMs to de- sign task-related dense reward functions based on basic de- scriptions of the environment and tasks, named as Reward Designer. These reward functions are used to train agents after self-verification, i.e. Reward Critic. To address poten- tial biases or oversights in LLM’s understanding, we also propose a LLM-based Trajectory Analyzer to analyze and summarize collected trajectories from the trained agent, and automatically help Reward Designer to improve the reward functions. We verify the effectiveness of Auto MC-Reward on a se- ries of representative benchmarks, including horizontal ex- ploration for diamonds underground and approaching trees and animals on the plains biome. Experiments show that Auto MC-Reward achieves significantly better results on these tasks compared to original sparse reward and existing dense reward methods, showing its advanced ability of em- powering efficient learning on sparse reward tasks. By iter- atively refining the design of rewards functions, Auto MC- Reward enables the agent to efficiently learn new behaviors that is beneficial to the corresponding tasks, e.g. avoiding lava, which greatly improves the success rate. Moreover, Auto MC-Reward achieves a high diamond obtaining suc- cess rate (36.5%) with only raw information, demonstrating its ability of solving long-horizon tasks. 2. Related Work Minecraft Agents are intelligent agents designed to accom- plish various tasks while playing the game Minecraft. Most of previous works adopt reinforcement learning for agent training. Due to the extremely sparse rewards and com- plex decision space of Minecraft tasks, early attempts have tried hierarchical RL [29, 33, 40, 41], curriculum learn- ing [22], and imitation learning [1] to empower more ef- ficient RL training. To narrow the decision space, recent work [3] build a foundation model by performing imita- tion on YouTube videos. DreamerV3 [16] instead learns a world model that explores the environment efficiently. As the LLMs demonstrate their general planning ability, a se- ries of research [18, 45, 46, 50, 52] leverage LLMs as high- level planners that decompose long-term complex tasks as basic skills and implement the skills with RL agents or handcrafted scripts. Auto MC-Reward aims to design dense rewards for Minecraft tasks automatically using LLMs, which is orthog- onal to previous works on Minecraft agents that mainly fo- cus on RL learning algorithms or high-level planning. Efficient Learning in Sparse Reward Tasks is a long- standing challenge in reinforcement learning due to the lack of effective learning signals [25]. A common solution is to handcraft dense reward functions that provide intermediate reward signals based on human expertise, which requires 2 time-consuming trial-and-error for each environment and task. Another line of previous research focus on proposing general-purpose dense auxiliary reward functions, such as curiosity-driven exploration [6, 19, 27, 36], self-imitation learning [34], and goal-conditioned reinforcement learn- ing [2, 23, 26, 44]. Despite the success on certain spe- cific tasks, the applicability of these methods in the com- plex environment of Minecraft remains uncertain. Recent works [9, 10, 13, 30, 31] also propose to use pre-trained models to assign reward to intermediate states of complet- ing tasks. However, these approaches produce reward val- ues in a black-box manner, which cannot be interpreted and improved based on the experience of the agents, and the generalizability of these models on new tasks is not guaran- teed. In contrast, Auto MC-Reward automatically produces explainable reward functions according to the task descrip- tions. Moreover, the reward functions can be improved to be more precise based on the experience of the agent. Automated Reward Function Design aims to find an op- timal reward function that drives efficient reinforcement learning for interested tasks. Previous works [8, 14] employ evolutionary algorithm for searching optimal reward func- tions for specific tasks. Most of these attempts have a highly constrained search space that only adjusts parameters of task-specific handcrafted reward templates. Recently, a se- ries of research [7, 10, 24, 28] employs LLMs for integrat- ing human preference into open-domain tasks without clear completion criteria by directly prompting LLMs with envi- ronment trajectories and natural language task descriptions. The reward values are generated on-the-fly by LLMs, which is black-box and has heavy computational cost due to the nature of LLMs. In contrast, Auto MC-Reward employs LLMs to generate white-box code-form reward functions. Concurrent works [32, 48, 49] also propose to use LLMs as a coder to generate reward functions for robotics con- trol tasks. Different from these methods, Auto MC-Reward considers more complex Minecraft environments that has diverse scenarios and high uncertainty, requiring more pre- cise and thorough reward designing. 3. Method Auto MC-Reward consists of three components: Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer. Given the environment information and task descriptions, the Re- ward Designer proposes the reward function by coding an executable Python function with pre-defined observation in- puts. The Reward Critic verifies if the proposed reward function is self-consistent and if it meets the format require- ments. The designed reward function which passes the Re- ward Critic is used to train agents in the environment. To improve the designed reward function according to empiri- cal experience, the Trajectory Analyzer is proposed to sum- marize possible failure causes and provide refinement sug- gestions on the reward function based on the inference tra- jectories of the trained agents. Then the Reward Designer modifies the reward function based on the feedback from Trajectory Analyzer. Figure 1 shows the overview of the Auto MC-Reward. 3.1. Reward Designer We utilize a Reward Designer to generate the reward func- tion code to provide intermediate instructive learning sig- nals to the agent. It takes as input task descriptions, game information, and reward function requirements, generating reward functions in executable code form. When updating reward function, we also provide analysis of the agent’s per- formance when interacting with the game environment. The input prompt is introduced in Section 4.2. The generated reward function uses a pre-defined obser- vation format as input. This includes the nearest distance of each block type within the visible range in the current and previous steps, changes in inventory between adjacent steps, health points, and the agent’s location in each past step. These parameters can provide information on the agent’s current and historical states, assisting the reward function in various situations. Multi-Step Memory. Long-term tasks require the transfer of information across multiple steps. Thus, we introduce a multi-step memory mechanism. It is provided to Reward Designer as a empty dictionary at the beginning, and the reward function can save necessary data into the memory to be used in future steps. In the actual reward function of the explore-tree task, we observed that the agent records the distance to a tree at each step, thereby encouraging getting closer with the tree than the previous step. Chain of Thought. We require the LLM to first describe its design thoughts, such as considering potential failure rea- sons and the details of the reward function design. These thoughts are to be written as comments at the beginning of the code. This is a mechanism similar to Chain of Thought (CoT) [47], where the thought process precedes the cod- ing implementation. In the specific code implementation, necessary comments will also be generated every few lines (e.g., “Check if lava is in the field of view in the previous step”). This approach not only allows Reward Designer to refer to the text-form thoughts during reward function ini- tialization, but also assists subsequent Reward Critic in as- sessing the code’s rationality, and helps Reward Designer to understand the current reward function’s purpose when updating the reward function. Scale Constraints. We impose a specific scale constraint for the reward function, where the LLM generates two sub- functions: dense and sparse. Sparse denotes rewards for 3 achieving the final goal or heavy penalties (like death), while dense represents dense intermediate signals during the task completion process. We preset their numerical val- ues and only allow the LLM to determine their positivity or negativity, limiting sparse to {1, 0, −1}, and dense to {0.1, 0, −0.1}. They are then added together for the final reward. Therefore, the final reward values can be one value of {±1.1, ±1.0, ±0.9, ±0.1, 0}. The final reward is calcu- lated as R = sgn(sparse)∗1+sgn(dense)∗0.1, where sgn denotes the sign function. This is to keep the reward within a reasonable range, allowing the LLM to focus on various scenarios that need to be considered in the reward function, rather than trivial tasks like adjusting the reward value. 3.2. Reward Critic In practice, it is difficult for LLM to generate a relatively complete reward function in the beginning. There may be errors in understanding parameter formats and data types (syntax errors), failure to consider game-specific informa- tion, or misunderstanding of tasks (semantic errors), etc. In order to eliminate above errors that are not easy to find, we design a LLM based Reward Critic to automati- cally review the designed reward function. In addition to checking for syntax errors, Reward Critic is also asked to check the quality of the reward function to further eliminate semantic errors. Specifically, we require Reward Critic to check whether the current code implementation matches its thoughts, whether it meets the reward function design re- quirements, and whether it takes game information into ac- count. If the review fails, the Critic will provide a critique, and the Reward Designer will then modify the reward func- tion based on the criterion and submit it for review again. The above process is repeated up to 3 times. If an error occurs during the execution of the reward function in the process of interacting with the environment, the Python traceback of the error message will be fed back to Reward Designer for modification. These errors may in- clude misunderstandings of input parameters, list index out of range, uninitialized keys in dictionaries, and other such issues. Some runtime errors only appear during the actual execution of the code. 3.3. Trajectory Analyzer LLMs have the ability to understand environmental infor- mation and task instructions through in-context prompts to generate dense rewards. However, this zero-shot approach completely relies on LLM’s understanding of the task and imagination of the problems it may face, and it is difficult to ensure the effectiveness of the designed reward. Take the the yellow highlighted part in Figure 1 as an example, in the initially designed reward function, Reward Designer does not consider the situation where the agent would encounter lava and be burned to death. Thus, in order to introduce em- Trajectory Analyzer history_location: [7,48,9],[6,48,9],[7,48,9], [7,48,9],[6,48,9],[7,48,9] Encourage exploration by whether current location is never visited before Penalize for encountering lava Add a pitch constraint to prevent from always looking up to avoid seeing lava Step 1 dead: True nearby_blocks: lava {pitch: 0, nearby_block: lava}, {pitch: -45, nearby_block: none} {pitch: -45, nearby_block: none} Trajectory Analyzer Trajectory Analyzer Step 2 Step 3 Step 1 update Step 2 update Step 3 update Figure 2. Example of updating the reward function. Trajectory Analyzer provides analysis for three scenarios at different steps, and then Reward Designer update the reward function based on the suggestions. We only display part of the trajectory data for brevity. Step 1: rewrite the code of encouraging exploration to avoid going back and forth. Step 2: add lava penalty to avoid falling into lava. Step 3: add pitch constraint to avoid constantly looking up to avoid lava. pirical improvements to the designed dense reward, we pro- pose to use LLMs, named as Trajectory Analyzer, to sum- marize the historical information of the interaction between the trained agent and the environment and use it to guide the revision of the reward function. The division of labor of Reward Designer and Trajectory Analyzer allows for in- dependent operations of data analysis and reward function updates. Trajectory Analyzer does not need to know the de- tails of the reward function, and Reward Designer does not need to process complex trajectory data. Specifically, the current trained model is used to inter- 4 act with the environment and obtain K trajectories. Then, we truncate these trajectories and use a LLM to summarize the observations of the last consecutive L frames of each failed trajectory to automatically infer its possible failure reasons. Based on the analysis of the reasons for the fail- ure, the LLM Trajectory Analyzer is asked to propose key points that Reward Designer needs to consider in the next round of reward function revision. For instance, failure sce- narios where punishment is not considered, misalignment of dense reward and sparse reward causes the agent’s behavior to deviate from the final goal, etc. Figure 2 shows an example of multiple rounds of im- proving the reward function during the search for diamonds. In the first step, through analysis of the trajectory, Trajec- tory Analyzer finds that the agent would opportunistically find a shortcut to increase the reward, that is, move back and forth to deceive the reward function into thinking that the agent is moving actively. Therefore, the Reward De- signer modifies the code snippet that encourages the agent to move, i.e. encourage the agent to appear in unvisited lo- cations as much as possible. Although the initially designed reward function has taken into account the penalty for the loss of the agent’s health, the agent still cannot effectively learn to avoid lava. When modifying the reward function in the second round, Trajectory Analyzer discovers through the failed trajectory that the agent may die from lava, so it is suggested that Reward Designer increase the penalty for en- countering lava, as shown in the step 2 update in Figure 2. According to the interactive experience, Reward Designer explicitly punishes the continuous appearance of lava in the field of view. However, the excessive punishment of lava caused the agent to choose to turn its perspective upward or downward to avoid the appearance of lava in the visible range, making it impossible for the agent to continue ef- fective exploration, which deviates from the ultimate goal. To this end, Reward Designer further constrain the agent’s perspective in step 3, so that the lava disappeared from the agent’s perspective by turning left/right while continuing to search for diamonds, which is the desired strategy. Fig- ure 3(a) shows the successful trajectory of avoiding lava: The agent sees the lava after breaking the stone ahead using iron pickaxe, and then turn left to avoid the lava through the mining tunnel. 4. Experiment 4.1. Environment Setup We mainly use the harvest mode in the MineDojo [13] en- vironment to verify the model’s ability to play Minecraft. The training pseudo code of Auto MC-Reward is shown in Algorithm 1. We set up the following challenging tasks for model performance comparison and ablation study: • Explore diamond ore on the 11-th floor under- Algorithm 1 Auto MC-Reward Training Pseudo Code Require: Task (T), Inital Agent (A0), Environment (Env), Max number of Critic reviews (NCritic) Ensure: Final Agent (AN), Final Reward (RN) Summary = None Critique = None R0 = None for i = 1, . . . , N do Ri = RewardDesigner(Summary, Critique, T, Ri−1) for j = 1, . . . , NCritic do Critique, Done = RewardCritic(Ri) if Done then break else Ri = RewardDesigner(Summary, Critique, T, Ri) end if end for Ai = TrainAgent(A0, Ri, Env, T) Traji, Stati = Eval(Env, Ai) Summary = TrajectoryAnalyzer(Traji, Stati) Critique = None end for ground: Initially, the agent is equipped with an iron pickaxe on the 11-th floor underground. When the dia- mond ore is within the visible range and the distance is less than 2 distance units, the task is deemed completed. The difficulty of the task lies in the fact that diamonds are very rare, lava frequently appears during exploration, leading to death, and the maximum number of steps is limited to 60,000. When steps exceed the limit, the tra- jectory is considered failed. Long-term exploration can demonstrate the advantages of dense rewards. • Approach tree on plains biome : The task is con- sidered successful if the tree is within the agent’s vis- ible range and the distance is less than 1 distance unit. The difficulty of the task lies in the fact that the trees are very sparse on plains, which is extremely detrimental to sparse reward functions. The maximum number of steps is limited to 2,000 steps. • Approach specific animal (e.g. cow , sheep ) on plains biome : The task is considered successful if the animal is within the agent’s visible range and the dis- tance is less than 2 distance unit. The difficulty of the task is that the animals are constantly moving. The maximum number of steps is limited to 2,000 steps. • Obtaining diamond : The agent needs to complete the whole process of mining diamonds, including key be- haviors such as finding and obtaining materials on the sur- face, crafting, digging down, going back to the ground, and mining stone/iron ore/diamond ore. The tech tree is shown in Figure 4. 5 Figure 3. The trajectories of the new behaviors. (a) Avoid lava when exploring for diamond ore . (b) Attack cow in plains villages. 4.2. Implementation Details LLM Prompt. The components of the input prompts for Trajectory Analyzer include task description, game infor- mation, statistical metrics, and information on failed trajec- tories. Components of the input prompts for Reward De- signer and Reward Critic includes task description, game information, input parameters, and reward function require- ments and format. We use GPT-4 [35] for all the LLM com- ponents, and set temperature to 0.3. • Instruction: Instructions on initializing, updating and handling execution error of reward function for Reward Designer, reviewing function for Reward Critic, and ana- lyzing trajectory for Trajectory Analyzer. • Task description: The objective, initial conditions, suc- cess criteria, and task flow. For example, for the explore diamond task, the objective is \\"to find and approach a diamond, achieving a high success rate while avoiding death.\\" The initial condition is \\"agent at y level 11 with an iron pickaxe.\\" The success criteria is \\"being less than 1 meter from the nearest diamond block\\", and the task flow is \\"horizontally explore to find a diamond, face it, and approach it\\". In the task description, we do not provide prior game strategy information (task challenges, DFS ex- ploration strategies, or avoiding lava, etc.) to ensure the method’s versatility. • Game information: Game version, block names, field of view, action space, and units of measurement. Game information provides knowledge about the game’s simu- lation environment, not game strategy. • Statistical metrics and information on failed trajec- tories: success rates, and actions sequences, reward se- quences, final inventory and nearby blocks of K = 10 failed trajectories. If a trajectory exceeds L = 32 steps, it is truncated to the last 32 steps. • Input parameters: The nearest distance of each block type within the visible range in the current and previous steps, changes in inventory between adjacent steps, health points, and the agent’s location in each past step. The memory is also provided as an input parameter for storing information to monitor changes across different steps. We provide explanation and examples of the parameters in the input prompt. • Reward function requirements and format: We require the Designer to write a dense function and a sparse func- tion, and consider only the sign of the two functions’ re- turn values, not the magnitude. The detail of the scale constraints is in Section 3.1. Imitation Learning Details. When large labeled datasets do not exist, the canonical strategy for training capable agents is RL, which is inefficient and expensive to sam- ple for hard-exploration problems [3, 4, 20], e.g. mining diamond in Minecraft. Therefore, in order to more effi- ciently explore the effectiveness of the LLM-based reward function design mechanism proposed in this paper, we pre- trained some foundation models through imitation learning as done by VPT [3]. Specifically, we use GITM [52] to continuously perform Diamond Mining task and record im- portant observation data of each frame, such as RGB, ac- tion, inventory, GPS, compass, structured actions, etc. In the end, we collect about 11 million image data, totaling about 153 hours (the control frequency is 20 Hz) of game videos. Subsequently, we train these data through fully su- pervised learning by using Impala CNN [12] and Trans- former [43] as backbone, and obtained several foundation models. The main differences between the foundation mod- els are different biomes (forest and plains), temporal frames (16 and 128), and whether goal embedding is used. In sub- sequent experiments, these foundation models were used in two different purposes: 6 Table 1. Comparison with other reward methods on three Minecraft tasks.

RL Training Details. We use proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm [38] with generalized advantage estima- tion (GAE) [37] to train our RL model. We use γ = 0.99 and λ = 0.95 for all of our experiments, and the total train- ing frames is 256,000. To prevent catastrophically forget- ting or overly aggressive policy update during RL training, we follow VPT [3] to apply an auxiliary Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss between the RL model and the frozen pre-trained policy. We also normalize the reward based on the trajectory returns to constrain the gradient scales of dif- ferent tasks. See Appendix for details. 4.3. Main Results Baselines. We compare our Auto MC-Reward against the following methods: • Naive Handcraft: The agent keeps moving (and min- ing for diamond exploration task) in one direction with a small probability of turning left/right. • Imitation Learning: Our foundation model pre-trained with GITM-generated data, as introduced in Section 4.2. • RL with Sparse Reward: Use only the reward from the original environment, i.e. only receives a reward when the success criteria is completed. • RL with Curiosity Dense Reward [36]: Encourage the agent to discover and learn about parts of the environment that it has not encountered before. • RL with Self-Imitation Dense Reward [34]: Encourage the agent to replicate its past actions that led to high re- wards. • RL with MineCLIP [13] Dense Reward: Use MineCLIP to calculate the dense reward based on the sim- ilarity between RGB frames and task objectives. Results on Diamond Ore Exploration Task. For the plain imitation learning model, fitting the training data makes it lack the awareness of avoiding lava, so it often dies in lava during the search for diamonds, and only has 38.9% success rate under the limit of 60,000 steps, as shown in Ta- ble 1. In contrast, our Auto MC-Reward makes the agent realize the importance of avoiding lava by continuously im- proving the dense reward function, and the final diamond success rate has increased to 45.2% with 70% lava escape success rate. Figure 3(a) demonstrates good awareness of avoiding lava. Based on the same reinforcement learning algorithm, the disadvantages of sparse reward functions in 7 Figure 4. The tech tree of obtaining diamond. The green squares are tasks to be optimized with Auto MC-Reward, i.e. obtaining log , cobblestone , iron ore and diamond . long-horizon tasks are undoubtedly revealed. By watching the videos of collected trajectories, we find that using sparse functions often leads to irreversible behavior, such as be- ing unable to break the surrounding ores to move due to maintaining a head-up posture. Although a low death rate of 1.5% is achieved, the actual average moving distance is only 16.8, and the success rate is only 0.5%. Due to the similar scenes underground, MineCLIP cannot give differ- entiated rewards, so its performance is close to the initial imitation learning model. Other baselines, like curiosity and self-imitation dense reward, also have mediocre perfor- mance and the success rate has not been significantly im- proved. Results on Tree Approaching Task. Since trees are ex- tremely sparse on the plain, the imitation learning model and the RL model with sparse reward cannot perform well, with only 2.5% and 4.3% success rates respectively, and their average action steps are close to the maximum limit. Table 1 shows that MineCLIP dense reward receives a suc- cess rate of 65.6% since it can provide positive reward when tree is visible. Curiosity and self-imitation methods also achieve better results than imitation learning. For Auto MC- Reward, Reward Designer uses a strategy of giving positive rewards for getting closer and deducting rewards for going away, so that the agent learns to slowly approach the tar- get, ultimately achieving 73.4% success rate with only 972 average action steps. Results on Cow Approaching Task. The task of explor- ing for cows does not appear in the training data of imitation learning, so the zero-shot ability on this task is not ideal, with about 22.4% success rate and average steps close to the maximum limit. By checking the videos, we find most of the successful cases are due to good luck without inten- tion to actively approach the target. The same experimental conclusion is also obtained in the experiment of sparse re- ward function. Similar to the Tree Approaching Task, the superior dense reward function design mechanism makes our agent 43.7% (56.3% vs. 12.6%) higher than sparse re- ward, as listed in Table 1. Another dense reward MineCLIP also shows strong performance in this task, but due to the need to calculate the similarity of images and texts at all times during training, the efficiency is unacceptable. Figure 5. Cumulative success rates for 4 key items of obtaining diamond on forest and plains biomes. In terms of diamond, the performance comparison between imitation learning and Auto MC-Reward in two biomes are: 28.8% vs. 36.5%, and 0% vs. 28.1%. Results on Obtaining Diamond . We verify the pro- posed method on a more difficult task, that is, the tech tree of collecting diamonds, as shown in Figure 4. As mentioned before, our foundation imitation learning model already has a certain ability from birth to diamond mining. We use the proposed method to optimize several key tasks in the pro- cess to increase the success rate of final diamond acquisi- tion. The green parts in Figure 4 are the tasks that need to be optimized, i.e. obtaining log, cobblestone, iron ore and diamond. We conduct experiments on two biomes in Minecraft, and the cumulative success rate is shown in Fig- ure 5. Specifically, the lower death rate allows our agent to have a higher success rate in mining iron ore and dia- mond, and ultimately achieves 36.5% success rate on for- est biome, which is 7.7% higher than the imitation learning model. As for plains, the difficulty of obtaining log makes the imitation learning model unable to complete any tasks. Auto MC-Reward overcomes the difficulty of obtaining log, thus achieving a 28.1% success rate in obtaining diamonds. Table 2 provides a rough comparison of several different methods on the task of mining diamonds. We achieve a high success rate without exploiting unfair information (i.e. Lidar and Voxel) during the inference phase. 4.4. Ablation studies Effectiveness of Reward Designer. The first row of Table 3 is an RL experiment with a sparse reward function. As men- tioned before, it cannot explore diamonds normally. After adding Reward Designer, it regained the ability to explore under a dense reward function. Effectiveness of Reward Critic. As listed in Table 3, the success rate of exploring diamonds has increased from 35.1% to 40.5% by adding Reward Critic, because it can reduce the syntax and semantic errors in the code, making the training process more effective and sufficient. For exam- ple, the Trajectory Analyzer concludes that the agent died in 8 lava and asks the Reward Designer to add relevant penalties. However, without being checked by Critic for semantic er- rors, it is possible that the added code snippet uses the word \\"magma\\" instead of the correct one \\"lava\\". This will result in insufficient learning of lava avoidance, which is reflected in a 2.1% (43.1% vs. 45.2%) success rate difference. Effectiveness of Trajectory Analyzer. As observed in Ta- ble 3, Trajectory Analyzer is the key to helping the agent improve the success rate of completing tasks. It summa- rizes the reasons for failure to be fed into Reward Designer, allowing it to iteratively modify an appropriate dense re- ward function to guide the agent to overcome difficulties. In terms of Diamond Exploration Task, Trajectory Ana- lyzer provides timely feedback on the potential risks of lava, which greatly improves the survival rate and moving distance, ultimately effectively improving the success rate from 40.5% to 45.2%. 5. Conclusion We proposed Auto MC-Reward, an automated dense re- ward design framework for addressing challenges caused by sparse reward and complex environment of Minecraft. It addresses the issue of sparse rewards by leveraging LLMs to automatically generate dense reward functions, enhanc- ing learning efficiency. The system consists of three key components: Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajec- tory Analyzer, which are used for the design, verification and analysis of the reward function respectively. Auto MC- Reward’s capabilities are validated through experiments, demonstrating a remarkable improvement in success rate and learning efficiency in complex tasks in Minecraft. Auto MC-Reward humbly contributes to more effective learning in complex tasks through its automated dense reward func- tion design. We hope that our proposed method can pave the way for further research in reinforcement learning and its application to real-world problems.

Experiments on Other Minecraft Tasks A.1. Environment Setup This section conducts experiments on more Minecraft tasks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed reward function design mechanism. The experiments mainly includes the approaching task of three animals including pig , sheep and chicken , as well as the attacking task of cow . • Approaching animals on plains biome. The task is considered successful if the animal is within the agent’s visible range and the distance is less than 2 distance unit. The difficulty of the task is that the animals are constantly moving and small (e.g. chicken ). The maximum number of steps is limited to 2,000 steps. • Attacking cow on plains biome. The task is considered successful if the agent successfully kills a cow and obtains beef or leather . The maximum number of steps is limited to 4,000 steps. A.2. Results Table I compares the performance between imitation learning model and ours. As the task of approaching for animals does not appear in the training data of imitation learning, our method achieves a significant improvement in success rate in fewer steps compared to imitation learning model’s zero shot. In the more difficult task of attacking cow, our method also achieves clear advantages. By further checking the videos, we find most of the successful cases are due to good luck without intention to actively approach the target. In the supplementary materials, we have prepared several demo videos, in which we can clearly see that the agent trained by our method has a clear awareness of completing the corresponding tasks.

Foundation Model Imitation Learning B.1. Pretraining Data When large labeled datasets do not exist, the canonical strategy for training capable agents is RL, which is inefficient and expensive to sample for hard-exploration problems [3, 4, 20], e.g. mining diamond in Minecraft. Therefore, in order to more efficiently explore the effectiveness of the LLM-based reward function design mechanism proposed in this paper, we pre-trained some foundation models through imitation learning as done by VPT [3]. Specifically, we use GITM [52] to continuously perform Diamond Mining task and record important observation data of each frame, such as RGB, action, inventory, compass (e.g. y_level), structured action (action plans), etc. The following is the format of the collected data: { \\"action_plans\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"mine\\", \\"args\\": { \\"object\\": {\\"log\\": 1}, \\"tool\\": None }, \\"expectation\\": \\"Obtain 1 log\\" }, ... ], \\"actions\\": [ [0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0], 12 ... ], \\"y_level\\": [66, ...], \\"action_indices\\": [100, ...], \\"biomes\\": [\\"Forest\\", ...], \\"deaths\\": [0, ...], \\"visible_blocks\\": [ [ {\\"name\\": \\"wood\\", \\"nearest_distance\\": 0.71}, ... ], ... ], \\"visible_entities\\": [ [ {\\"name\\": \\"cow\\", \\"nearest_distance\\": 4.57}, ... ], ... ], \\"inventory\\": [{\\"log\\": 1}, ...], \\"task_names\\": [\\"Obtain 1 log\\", ...], \\"task_indices\\": [88, ...], } Finally, we collect approximately 20.5/5.3 million image data on forest/plains biome, as listed in Table II. To reduce training costs, we only use 9 million and 2 million image data for training and validation on forest and plains biomes, respectively, totaling about 153 hours of game video (the control frequency is 20 Hz).

Training Details Subsequently, we conduct fully supervised training on the four main tasks of the Diamond mining Task, i.e. log, cobblestone, iron ore, diamond, by using Impala CNN [12] and Transformer [43] as backbone, and obtained several foundation models. The main differences between the foundation models are different biomes (forest and plains), temporal frames (16 and 128), and whether goal and y_level embeddings are used as conditions. We use 32 A800 GPUs for foundation model training, and initialize the network using the foundation model of VPT to speed up the training of imitation learning. The hyperparameters are listed in Table IV. Table IV. Hyperparameters for imitation learning.

Based on these models, this paper uses the proposed methods to further improve existing behaviors (e.g. avoid lava while exploring diamond) and complete new tasks (e.g. approaching / killing animals). C. Reinforcement Learning Training We use proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm [38] with generalized advantage estimation (GAE) [37] implemented in TorchRL [5] library to train our RL model. The main hyperparameters used for RL training are listed in Table V. In addition to the above hyperparameters, several training techniques are applied to all of our experiments: • We follow VPT [3] to apply an auxiliary Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss between the RL model and the frozen pre- trained policy to prevent catastrophically forgetting or overly aggressive policy update during RL training, e.g., maintaining the ability to dig horizontal tunnels. This loss is defined as: Lkl = αKL(πpt, πθ) (1) where πθ is the the policy being trained, πpt is the frozen pretrained policy, KL(πpt, πθ)is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the policy being trained and the pretrained policy, and α is the loss weight that is set to 0.125 by default. 14 Table V.

The formula is as follows: R′ = mean(abs(R)) R′ cur = βR′ cur + (1 − β)R′ pre rnorm = r max(R′cur, 1) (2) where r and R are reward and trajectory returns. β is a momentum parameter, set as 0.7 by default. D. Full Text Prompts We provide all the LLM input prompts of our method in this section. D.1.

D.2. Reward Designer Prompts for Reward Designer include prompts for initializing reward function, updating reward function, and handling critic failure and execution error. Prompt for Initializing Reward Function You are now a proficient Minecraft player. You should help me write proper reward functions to train a Minecraft agent with reinforcement learning to complete the described task. {task_description} Input parameters of the reward function - current_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **current step**. It is a dictionary, consisting of the names, relative distances with the agent, and relative angles (yaw and pitch) with the agent, in the form of: {NAME_1: (DIST_1, YAW_1, PITCH_1), NAME_2: (DIST_2, YAW_2, PITCH_2)}. For example, {\\"wood\\": (24.7, 1.48, -1.57), \\"cobblestone\\": (1.3, -0.17, 1.05), \\"iron_ore\\": (4.5, 0.61, -0.17)}. If a certrain block type does not exist in the field of view, it is not present in the dictionary. The yaw and pitch here is relative to the agent’s front, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent. - previou_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **previous step**, with the same format as the current_nearest_blocks. - inventory_change: the change of the agent’s inventory from the previous step to current step, in the form of a dictionary: {NAME_1: CHANGE_NUM_1, NAME_2: CHANGE_NUM_2}. Positive values mean increase and negative values mean de- crease. For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. 16 - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable. It is initialized as a dictionary. You can save necessary information between different steps with it. General game information - The version of Minecraft is 1.11. - Common block names : dirt, cobblestone, iron, diamond, wood, coal, water, air, lava, leaves, ... Collected item names are the same. - FOV is set to -35 to 35 degrees for yaw and -30 to 30 degrees for pitch. The max visible distance of blocks is 64. - Length of each block is 1 meter. - The y coordinate of the agent is the agent’s height. The larger the y, the higher the agent. The ground level is around y = 63, but is not fixed. - At each step, the agent selects one operation in is action space. The action space includes doing nothing (i.e. staying still), moving forward and backward, jumping and attacking. The action space also includes turning left, right, up and down. - The attack range is 2 meters in front of the agent. The agent can move 0.2 meters in each step. The agent can turn 15 degrees in each step. Typically, the agent needs to stay still and attack for **60 successive steps** to break a block. - The hunger value is always at the max level. Reward function requirements - You should write a dense reward function \`dense\`and a sparse reward function \`sparse\`. The sparse reward indicates achieving the goal or receiving heavy punishment. The dense reward provides intermediate signal to guide the agent in the process of achieving the goal. The magnitude of the return value does not matter, but the sign (positive or negative) is important. The final reward will be \`np.sign(sparse(...)) * 1 + np.sign(dense(...)) * 0.1\`. Output Requirements - The reward function should be written in Python 3.9. - Output the code block only. **Do not output anything else outside the code block**. - You should include **sufficient comments** in your reward function to explain your thoughts, the objective and **implementa- tion details**. The implementation can be specified to a specific line of code. - If you need to import packages (e.g. math, numpy) or define helper functions, define them at the beginning of the function. Do not use unimported packages and undefined functions. Output format Strictly follow the following format. **Do not output anything else outside the code block**. def reward_function(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): # Thoughts: # ... # (import packages and define helper functions) import numpy as np ... def dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... def sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... dense_reward = dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) sparse_reward = sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) return np.sign(sparse_reward) * 1 + np.sign(dense_reward) * 0.1 ...

Examples of LLM-Designed Reward Functions We provide reward function examples for four tasks. For the attacking cow task, we add two extra input parameters dam- age_dealt and kill_entity, which records the amount of damage the agent caused and the amounts of each entity the agent killed, respectively. Algorithm I Reward Function Example of Exploring Diamond Ore def reward_function(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions , GLOBAL_DATA): \\"\\"\\" Thoughts: In order to make the agent approach the diamond, we need to give positive rewards for actions that make the agent get closer to the diamond and negative rewards for actions that make the agent get further from the diamond. We also need to give a negative reward if the agent’s health decreases to encourage the agent to avoid dangerous situations.

DESIGNER INPUT: You are now a proficient Minecraft player. You should help me write proper reward functions to train a Minecraft agent with reinforcement learning to complete the described task. Task description - Objective: Find and approach diamond with higher success rate and avoid death. - Initial Status: 1. The agent is under ground at y level 11, the most common level to find diamonds. 2. The agent already has an iron pickaxe. - Success criteria: The distance to the nearest diamond block is less than 2 meter. - Procedure: Explore horizontally to find a diamond, face it and approach it. Input parameters of the reward function - current_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **current step**. It is a dictionary, consisting of the names, relative distances with the agent, and relative angles (yaw and pitch) with the agent, in the form of: {NAME_1: (DIST_1, YAW_1, PITCH_1), NAME_2: (DIST_2, YAW_2, PITCH_2)}. For example, {\\"wood\\": (24.7, 1.48, -1.57), \\"cobblestone\\": (1.3, -0.17, 1.05), \\"iron_ore\\": (4.5, 0.61, -0.17)}. If a certrain block type does not exist in the field of view, it is not present in the dictionary. The yaw and pitch here is relative to the agent’s front, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent. - previou_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **previous step**, with the same format as the current_nearest_blocks. - inventory_change: the change of the agent’s inventory from the previous step to current step, in the form of a dictionary: {NAME_1: CHANGE_NUM_1, NAME_2: CHANGE_NUM_2}. Positive values mean increase and negative values mean de- crease. For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable. It is initialized as a dictionary. You can save necessary information between different steps with it. General game information - The version of Minecraft is 1.11. - Common block names : dirt, cobblestone, iron, diamond, wood, coal, water, air, lava, leaves, ... Collected item names are the same. - FOV is set to -35 to 35 degrees for yaw and -30 to 30 degrees for pitch. The max visible distance of blocks is 64. - Length of each block is 1 meter. - The y coordinate of the agent is the agent’s height. The larger the y, the higher the agent. The ground level is around y = 63, but is not fixed. - At each step, the agent selects one operation in is action space. The action space includes doing nothing (i.e. staying still), moving forward and backward, jumping and attacking. The action space also includes turning left, right, up and down. - The attack range is 2 meters in front of the agent. The agent can move 0.2 meters in each step. The agent can turn 15 degrees in each step. Typically, the agent needs to stay still and attack for **60 successive steps** to break a block. - The hunger value is always at the max level. 30 Reward function requirements - You should write a dense reward function \`dense\`and a sparse reward function \`sparse\`. The sparse reward indicates achieving the goal or receiving heavy punishment. The dense reward provides intermediate signal to guide the agent in the process of achieving the goal. The magnitude of the return value does not matter, but the sign (positive or negative) is important. The final reward will be \`np.sign(sparse(...)) * 1 + np.sign(dense(...)) * 0.1\`. Output Requirements - The reward function should be written in Python 3.9. - Output the code block only. **Do not output anything else outside the code block**. - You should include **sufficient comments** in your reward function to explain your thoughts, the objective and **implementa- tion details**. The implementation can be specified to a specific line of code. - If you need to import packages (e.g. math, numpy) or define helper functions, define them at the beginning of the function. Do not use unimported packages and undefined functions. Output format Strictly follow the following format. **Do not output anything else outside the code block**. def reward_function(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): # Thoughts: # ... # (import packages and define helper functions) import numpy as np ... def dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... def sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... dense_reward = dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) sparse_reward = sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) return np.sign(sparse_reward) * 1 + np.sign(dense_reward) * 0.1 ...

For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable. It is initialized as a dictionary. You can save necessary information between different steps with it. General game information - The version of Minecraft is 1.11. - Common block names : dirt, cobblestone, iron, diamond, wood, coal, water, air, lava, leaves, ... Collected item names are the same. - FOV is set to -35 to 35 degrees for yaw and -30 to 30 degrees for pitch. The max visible distance of blocks is 64. - Length of each block is 1 meter. - The y coordinate of the agent is the agent’s height. The larger the y, the higher the agent. The ground level is around y = 63, but is not fixed. - At each step, the agent selects one operation in is action space. The action space includes doing nothing (i.e. staying still), moving forward and backward, jumping and attacking. The action space also includes turning left, right, up and down. - The attack range is 2 meters in front of the agent. The agent can move 0.2 meters in each step. The agent can turn 15 degrees in each step. Typically, the agent needs to stay still and attack for **60 successive steps** to break a block. - The hunger value is always at the max level. Reward function requirements - You should write a dense reward function \`dense\`and a sparse reward function \`sparse\`. The sparse reward indicates achieving the goal or receiving heavy punishment. The dense reward provides intermediate signal to guide the agent in the process of achieving the goal. The magnitude of the return value does not matter, but the sign (positive or negative) is important. The final reward will be \`np.sign(sparse(...)) * 1 + np.sign(dense(...)) * 0.1\`. Requirements 37 1. You should check whether the reward function meets the **reward function requirements** above. 2. Your judgement should consider whether the comments and the detailed implementation code are consistent. You can judge whether a line is correct by its comment, but do only rely on the comments. 3. You should also check the format of the reward function. It should be like: def reward_function(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): # Thoughts: # ... # (import packages and define helper functions) import numpy as np ... def dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... def sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... dense_reward = dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) sparse_reward = sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) return np.sign(sparse_reward) * 1 + np.sign(dense_reward) * 0.1 ... 4. Consider the **Information about the game state** above. 5. **You don’t need to check whether the reward function meets the task description**. 6. You should first provide a reasoning and decision. If the reward function fails, provide a critique to help to improve the reward function. Output format You should only respond in JSON format as described below: { \\"reasoning\\": \\"reasoning\\", \\"success\\": boolean, \\"critique\\": critique, } Ensure the response can be parsed by Python \`json.loads\`, e.g. no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc. Do not output anything else like explanations. Reward function to be evaluated def reward_function(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): \\"\\"\\" Thoughts: In order to make the agent approach the diamond, we need to give positive rewards for actions that make the agent get closer to the diamond and negative rewards for actions that make the agent get further from the diamond. We also need to give a negative reward if the agent’s health decreases to encourage the agent to avoid dangerous situations. The dense reward function will be based on the distance to the diamond and health. The sparse reward function will give a large positive reward when the agent reaches the diamond and a large negative reward when the agent dies. \\"\\"\\" import numpy as np def dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): # Initialize reward 38 reward = 0 # If the agent is closer to diamond than before, give a positive reward if \\"diamond\\" in current_nearest_blocks and \\"diamond\\" in previous_nearest_blocks: if current_nearest_blocks[\\"diamond\\"][0] < previous_nearest_blocks[\\"diamond\\"][0]: reward += 1 elif current_nearest_blocks[\\"diamond\\"][0] > previous_nearest_blocks[\\"diamond\\"][0]: reward -= 1 # If the agent’s health decreases, give a negative reward if \\"health\\" in GLOBAL_DATA: if health < GLOBAL_DATA[\\"health\\"]: reward -= 1 GLOBAL_DATA[\\"health\\"] = health return reward def sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): # Initialize reward reward = 0 # If the agent reaches the diamond, give a large positive reward if \\"diamond\\" in current_nearest_blocks and current_nearest_blocks[\\"diamond\\"][0] < 1: reward += 100 # If the agent dies, give a large negative reward if health == 0: reward -= 100 return reward dense_reward = dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) sparse_reward = sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) return np.sign(dense_reward) * 1 + np.sign(sparse_reward) * 0.1 ——————————————————————————————————————————————– CRITIC OUTPUT: { \\"reasoning\\": \\"The reward function meets the requirements.

Reasons of Failure and Inefficiency: In one of the failed trajectories, the agent died due to lava. The agent did not take any action to avoid the lava or move away from it. The agent should be programmed to detect and avoid dangerous blocks, such as lava, by turning or moving in a different direction. Suggestion on Game Strategy: Train the agent to detect and avoid dangerous blocks, such as lava or deep holes. The agent should be programmed to prioritize safety and avoid situations that could lead to death or loss of health. By implementing the suggestion and improving the agent’s training, the success rate of finding diamonds can be increased. ——————————————————————————————————————————————– DESIGNER INPUT: You are now a proficient Minecraft player. I now have a reward function to train a Minecraft agent with reinforcement learning to complete the described task. The reward function is used to train the reinforcement learning agent for several times. I will provide you the analysis of failure and inefficiency and suggestions. You should help me modify the reward function. Task description - Objective: Find and approach diamond with higher success rate and avoid death. - Initial Status: 1. The agent is under ground at y level 11, the most common level to find diamonds. 2. The agent already has an iron pickaxe. - Success criteria: The distance to the nearest diamond block is less than 2 meter. - Procedure: Explore horizontally to find a diamond, face it and approach it. Input parameters of the reward function - current_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **current step**. It is a dictionary, consisting of the names, relative distances with the agent, and relative angles (yaw and pitch) with the agent, in the form of: {NAME_1: (DIST_1, YAW_1, PITCH_1), NAME_2: (DIST_2, YAW_2, PITCH_2)}. For example, {\\"wood\\": (24.7, 1.48, -1.57), \\"cobblestone\\": (1.3, -0.17, 1.05), \\"iron_ore\\": (4.5, 0.61, -0.17)}. If a certrain block type does not exist in the field of view, it is not present in the dictionary. The yaw and pitch here is relative to the agent’s front, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent. - previou_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **previous step**, with the same format as the current_nearest_blocks. 44 - inventory_change: the change of the agent’s inventory from the previous step to current step, in the form of a dictionary: {NAME_1: CHANGE_NUM_1, NAME_2: CHANGE_NUM_2}. Positive values mean increase and negative values mean de- crease. For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable. It is initialized as a dictionary. You can save necessary information between different steps with it. General game information - The version of Minecraft is 1.11. - Common block names : dirt, cobblestone, iron, diamond, wood, coal, water, air, lava, leaves, ... Collected item names are the same. - FOV is set to -35 to 35 degrees for yaw and -30 to 30 degrees for pitch. The max visible distance of blocks is 64. - Length of each block is 1 meter. - The y coordinate of the agent is the agent’s height. The larger the y, the higher the agent. The ground level is around y = 63, but is not fixed. - At each step, the agent selects one operation in is action space. The action space includes doing nothing (i.e. staying still), moving forward and backward, jumping and attacking. The action space also includes turning left, right, up and down. - The attack range is 2 meters in front of the agent. The agent can move 0.2 meters in each step. The agent can turn 15 degrees in each step. Typically, the agent needs to stay still and attack for **60 successive steps** to break a block. - The hunger value is always at the max level. Reward function requirements - You should write a dense reward function \`dense\`and a sparse reward function \`sparse\`. The sparse reward indicates achieving the goal or receiving heavy punishment. The dense reward provides intermediate signal to guide the agent in the process of achieving the goal.

Here is some analysis of failure and inefficiency and suggestions: \`\`\` Analysis of Possible Reasons of Failure and Inefficiency: In one of the failed trajectories, the agent died due to lava. The agent did not take any action to avoid the lava or move away from it. The agent should be programmed to detect and avoid dangerous blocks, such as lava, by turning or moving in a different direction. Suggestion on Game Strategy: Train the agent to detect and avoid dangerous blocks, such as lava or deep holes. The agent should be programmed to prioritize safety and avoid situations that could lead to death or loss of health. By implementing the suggestion and improving the agent’s training, the success rate of finding diamonds can be increased. \`\`\` Requirements Please consider the analysis and suggestions above and modify the reward function. 1.

I will give you a reward function written in Python, which is used to train an RL agent to play Minecraft. You should help me to evaluate whether the reward function has met the requirements. Task description - Objective: Find and approach diamond with higher success rate and avoid death. - Initial Status: 1. The agent is under ground at y level 11, the most common level to find diamonds. 2. The agent already has an iron pickaxe. - Success criteria: The distance to the nearest diamond block is less than 2 meter. - Procedure: Explore horizontally to find a diamond, face it and approach it. Input parameters of the reward function - current_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **current step**. It is a dictionary, consisting of the names, relative distances with the agent, and relative angles (yaw and pitch) with the agent, in the form of: {NAME_1: (DIST_1, YAW_1, PITCH_1), NAME_2: (DIST_2, YAW_2, PITCH_2)}. For example, {\\"wood\\": (24.7, 1.48, -1.57), \\"cobblestone\\": (1.3, -0.17, 1.05), \\"iron_ore\\": (4.5, 0.61, -0.17)}. If a certrain block type does not exist in the field of view, it is not present in the dictionary. The yaw and pitch here is relative to the agent’s front, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent. - previou_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **previous step**, with the same format as the current_nearest_blocks. - inventory_change: the change of the agent’s inventory from the previous step to current step, in the form of a dictionary: {NAME_1: CHANGE_NUM_1, NAME_2: CHANGE_NUM_2}. Positive values mean increase and negative values mean de- crease. For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable. It is initialized as a dictionary. You can save necessary information between different steps with it. General game information - The version of Minecraft is 1.11. - Common block names : dirt, cobblestone, iron, diamond, wood, coal, water, air, lava, leaves, ... Collected item names are the same. - FOV is set to -35 to 35 degrees for yaw and -30 to 30 degrees for pitch. The max visible distance of blocks is 64. - Length of each block is 1 meter. - The y coordinate of the agent is the agent’s height. The larger the y, the higher the agent. The ground level is around y = 63, but is not fixed. - At each step, the agent selects one operation in is action space. The action space includes doing nothing (i.e. staying still), moving forward and backward, jumping and attacking. The action space also includes turning left, right, up and down. 48 - The attack range is 2 meters in front of the agent. The agent can move 0.2 meters in each step. The agent can turn 15 degrees in each step. Typically, the agent needs to stay still and attack for **60 successive steps** to break a block. - The hunger value is always at the max level. Reward function requirements - You should write a dense reward function \`dense\`and a sparse reward function \`sparse\`. The sparse reward indicates achieving the goal or receiving heavy punishment. The dense reward provides intermediate signal to guide the agent in the process of achieving the goal. The magnitude of the return value does not matter, but the sign (positive or negative) is important. The final reward will be \`np.sign(sparse(...)) * 1 + np.sign(dense(...)) * 0.1\`. Requirements 1. You should check whether the reward function meets the **reward function requirements** above. 2. Your judgement should consider whether the comments and the detailed implementation code are consistent. You can judge whether a line is correct by its comment, but do only rely on the comments. 3. You should also check the format of the reward function. It should be like: def reward_function(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): # Thoughts: # ... # (import packages and define helper functions) import numpy as np ... def dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... def sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... dense_reward = dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) sparse_reward = sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) return np.sign(sparse_reward) * 1 + np.sign(dense_reward) * 0.1 ... 4. Consider the **Information about the game state** above. 5. **You don’t need to check whether the reward function meets the task description**. 6. You should first provide a reasoning and decision. If the reward function fails, provide a critique to help to improve the reward function. Output format You should only respond in JSON format as described below: { \\"reasoning\\": \\"reasoning\\", \\"success\\": boolean, \\"critique\\": critique, } Ensure the response can be parsed by Python \`json.loads\`, e.g. no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc. Do not output anything else like explanations.

Auto MC-Reward consists of three important components: Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer. Given the environment in- formation and task descriptions, the Reward Designer first design the reward function by coding an executable Python function with predefined observation inputs. Then, our Reward Critic will be responsible for verifying the code, checking whether the code is self-consistent and free of syn- tax and semantic errors. Further, the Trajectory Analyzer summarizes possible failure causes and provides refinement suggestions according to collected trajectories. In the next round, Reward Designer will take further refine and iter- ate the dense reward function based on feedback.

Introduction Minecraft, as the world’s best-selling game, offers a range of tasks from exploration, survival to creating. It has be- come an important environment for researching efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) [15, 21]. In particular, its ex- treme sparsity of rewards and huge complexity of the de- cision space pose significant challenges for RL methods. Currently, the most effective learning strategy involves pre- training through behavior cloning [3], using learned be- havioral priors to narrow the decision space. Neverthe- less, it still requires billions of environmental interactions for effective learning due to the sparse reward nature of Minecraft. On the other hand, previous researchers have proposed a variety of dense reward signals to enable efficient learning for specific sparse reward tasks [2, 26, 27, 34, 36]. However, their applicability on the complex and long-horizon tasks in Minecraft remains an open question. To deeply reveal the challenges in Minecraft, we examine on several repre- sentative challenging tasks, e.g. exploring underground for diamonds. We find that even after behavior cloning, most of these methods still fail to make significant progress on these tasks, further highlighting the difficulty of Minecraft and the limitations of existing dense reward methods. It is noteworthy that for human players, Minecraft is a relatively simple casual game [11]. The advantage of hu- man lies in their ability to summarize based on practice. For example, an accidental burning death from lava can teach human to avoid getting too close to it. Such summaries, based on life experience and practice, are key to human in- telligence [39, 42]. Most existing RL methods overlook this ability. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated human-like common sense and reasoning capabilities [17, 35, 51]. We find that leverag- ing LLMs can help RL agents simulate the practice sum- marization abilities of human. Based on the historical ac- tion trajectories and success-failure signals of the agents, LLMs can automatically design and refine corresponding auxiliary rewards, effectively overcoming the sparse reward challenge in Minecraft. According to above analysis, we propose an automated method named Auto MC-Reward, to design and improve auxiliary reward functions according to task descriptions and historical action trajectories. This method utilizes the task understanding and experience summarization abilities of LLMs, providing detailed and immediate rewards for learning guidance. Specifically We first use LLMs to de- sign task-related dense reward functions based on basic de- scriptions of the environment and tasks, named as Reward Designer. These reward functions are used to train agents after self-verification, i.e. Reward Critic. To address poten- tial biases or oversights in LLM’s understanding, we also propose a LLM-based Trajectory Analyzer to analyze and summarize collected trajectories from the trained agent, and automatically help Reward Designer to improve the reward functions. We verify the effectiveness of Auto MC-Reward on a se- ries of representative benchmarks, including horizontal ex- ploration for diamonds underground and approaching trees and animals on the plains biome. Experiments show that Auto MC-Reward achieves significantly better results on these tasks compared to original sparse reward and existing dense reward methods, showing its advanced ability of em- powering efficient learning on sparse reward tasks. By iter- atively refining the design of rewards functions, Auto MC- Reward enables the agent to efficiently learn new behaviors that is beneficial to the corresponding tasks, e.g. avoiding lava, which greatly improves the success rate. Moreover, Auto MC-Reward achieves a high diamond obtaining suc- cess rate (36.5%) with only raw information, demonstrating its ability of solving long-horizon tasks. 2. Related Work Minecraft Agents are intelligent agents designed to accom- plish various tasks while playing the game Minecraft. Most of previous works adopt reinforcement learning for agent training. Due to the extremely sparse rewards and com- plex decision space of Minecraft tasks, early attempts have tried hierarchical RL [29, 33, 40, 41], curriculum learn- ing [22], and imitation learning [1] to empower more ef- ficient RL training. To narrow the decision space, recent work [3] build a foundation model by performing imita- tion on YouTube videos. DreamerV3 [16] instead learns a world model that explores the environment efficiently. As the LLMs demonstrate their general planning ability, a se- ries of research [18, 45, 46, 50, 52] leverage LLMs as high- level planners that decompose long-term complex tasks as basic skills and implement the skills with RL agents or handcrafted scripts. Auto MC-Reward aims to design dense rewards for Minecraft tasks automatically using LLMs, which is orthog- onal to previous works on Minecraft agents that mainly fo- cus on RL learning algorithms or high-level planning. Efficient Learning in Sparse Reward Tasks is a long- standing challenge in reinforcement learning due to the lack of effective learning signals [25]. A common solution is to handcraft dense reward functions that provide intermediate reward signals based on human expertise, which requires 2 time-consuming trial-and-error for each environment and task. Another line of previous research focus on proposing general-purpose dense auxiliary reward functions, such as curiosity-driven exploration [6, 19, 27, 36], self-imitation learning [34], and goal-conditioned reinforcement learn- ing [2, 23, 26, 44]. Despite the success on certain spe- cific tasks, the applicability of these methods in the com- plex environment of Minecraft remains uncertain. Recent works [9, 10, 13, 30, 31] also propose to use pre-trained models to assign reward to intermediate states of complet- ing tasks. However, these approaches produce reward val- ues in a black-box manner, which cannot be interpreted and improved based on the experience of the agents, and the generalizability of these models on new tasks is not guaran- teed. In contrast, Auto MC-Reward automatically produces explainable reward functions according to the task descrip- tions. Moreover, the reward functions can be improved to be more precise based on the experience of the agent. Automated Reward Function Design aims to find an op- timal reward function that drives efficient reinforcement learning for interested tasks. Previous works [8, 14] employ evolutionary algorithm for searching optimal reward func- tions for specific tasks. Most of these attempts have a highly constrained search space that only adjusts parameters of task-specific handcrafted reward templates. Recently, a se- ries of research [7, 10, 24, 28] employs LLMs for integrat- ing human preference into open-domain tasks without clear completion criteria by directly prompting LLMs with envi- ronment trajectories and natural language task descriptions. The reward values are generated on-the-fly by LLMs, which is black-box and has heavy computational cost due to the nature of LLMs. In contrast, Auto MC-Reward employs LLMs to generate white-box code-form reward functions. Concurrent works [32, 48, 49] also propose to use LLMs as a coder to generate reward functions for robotics con- trol tasks. Different from these methods, Auto MC-Reward considers more complex Minecraft environments that has diverse scenarios and high uncertainty, requiring more pre- cise and thorough reward designing. 3. Method Auto MC-Reward consists of three components: Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajectory Analyzer. Given the environment information and task descriptions, the Re- ward Designer proposes the reward function by coding an executable Python function with pre-defined observation in- puts. The Reward Critic verifies if the proposed reward function is self-consistent and if it meets the format require- ments. The designed reward function which passes the Re- ward Critic is used to train agents in the environment. To improve the designed reward function according to empiri- cal experience, the Trajectory Analyzer is proposed to sum- marize possible failure causes and provide refinement sug- gestions on the reward function based on the inference tra- jectories of the trained agents. Then the Reward Designer modifies the reward function based on the feedback from Trajectory Analyzer. Figure 1 shows the overview of the Auto MC-Reward. 3.1. Reward Designer We utilize a Reward Designer to generate the reward func- tion code to provide intermediate instructive learning sig- nals to the agent. It takes as input task descriptions, game information, and reward function requirements, generating reward functions in executable code form. When updating reward function, we also provide analysis of the agent’s per- formance when interacting with the game environment. The input prompt is introduced in Section 4.2. The generated reward function uses a pre-defined obser- vation format as input. This includes the nearest distance of each block type within the visible range in the current and previous steps, changes in inventory between adjacent steps, health points, and the agent’s location in each past step. These parameters can provide information on the agent’s current and historical states, assisting the reward function in various situations. Multi-Step Memory. Long-term tasks require the transfer of information across multiple steps. Thus, we introduce a multi-step memory mechanism. It is provided to Reward Designer as a empty dictionary at the beginning, and the reward function can save necessary data into the memory to be used in future steps. In the actual reward function of the explore-tree task, we observed that the agent records the distance to a tree at each step, thereby encouraging getting closer with the tree than the previous step. Chain of Thought. We require the LLM to first describe its design thoughts, such as considering potential failure rea- sons and the details of the reward function design. These thoughts are to be written as comments at the beginning of the code. This is a mechanism similar to Chain of Thought (CoT) [47], where the thought process precedes the cod- ing implementation. In the specific code implementation, necessary comments will also be generated every few lines (e.g., “Check if lava is in the field of view in the previous step”). This approach not only allows Reward Designer to refer to the text-form thoughts during reward function ini- tialization, but also assists subsequent Reward Critic in as- sessing the code’s rationality, and helps Reward Designer to understand the current reward function’s purpose when updating the reward function. Scale Constraints. We impose a specific scale constraint for the reward function, where the LLM generates two sub- functions: dense and sparse. Sparse denotes rewards for 3 achieving the final goal or heavy penalties (like death), while dense represents dense intermediate signals during the task completion process. We preset their numerical val- ues and only allow the LLM to determine their positivity or negativity, limiting sparse to {1, 0, −1}, and dense to {0.1, 0, −0.1}. They are then added together for the final reward. Therefore, the final reward values can be one value of {±1.1, ±1.0, ±0.9, ±0.1, 0}. The final reward is calcu- lated as R = sgn(sparse)∗1+sgn(dense)∗0.1, where sgn denotes the sign function. This is to keep the reward within a reasonable range, allowing the LLM to focus on various scenarios that need to be considered in the reward function, rather than trivial tasks like adjusting the reward value. 3.2. Reward Critic In practice, it is difficult for LLM to generate a relatively complete reward function in the beginning. There may be errors in understanding parameter formats and data types (syntax errors), failure to consider game-specific informa- tion, or misunderstanding of tasks (semantic errors), etc. In order to eliminate above errors that are not easy to find, we design a LLM based Reward Critic to automati- cally review the designed reward function. In addition to checking for syntax errors, Reward Critic is also asked to check the quality of the reward function to further eliminate semantic errors. Specifically, we require Reward Critic to check whether the current code implementation matches its thoughts, whether it meets the reward function design re- quirements, and whether it takes game information into ac- count. If the review fails, the Critic will provide a critique, and the Reward Designer will then modify the reward func- tion based on the criterion and submit it for review again. The above process is repeated up to 3 times. If an error occurs during the execution of the reward function in the process of interacting with the environment, the Python traceback of the error message will be fed back to Reward Designer for modification. These errors may in- clude misunderstandings of input parameters, list index out of range, uninitialized keys in dictionaries, and other such issues. Some runtime errors only appear during the actual execution of the code. 3.3. Trajectory Analyzer LLMs have the ability to understand environmental infor- mation and task instructions through in-context prompts to generate dense rewards. However, this zero-shot approach completely relies on LLM’s understanding of the task and imagination of the problems it may face, and it is difficult to ensure the effectiveness of the designed reward. Take the the yellow highlighted part in Figure 1 as an example, in the initially designed reward function, Reward Designer does not consider the situation where the agent would encounter lava and be burned to death. Thus, in order to introduce em- Trajectory Analyzer history_location: [7,48,9],[6,48,9],[7,48,9], [7,48,9],[6,48,9],[7,48,9] Encourage exploration by whether current location is never visited before Penalize for encountering lava Add a pitch constraint to prevent from always looking up to avoid seeing lava Step 1 dead: True nearby_blocks: lava {pitch: 0, nearby_block: lava}, {pitch: -45, nearby_block: none} {pitch: -45, nearby_block: none} Trajectory Analyzer Trajectory Analyzer Step 2 Step 3 Step 1 update Step 2 update Step 3 update Figure 2. Example of updating the reward function. Trajectory Analyzer provides analysis for three scenarios at different steps, and then Reward Designer update the reward function based on the suggestions. We only display part of the trajectory data for brevity. Step 1: rewrite the code of encouraging exploration to avoid going back and forth. Step 2: add lava penalty to avoid falling into lava. Step 3: add pitch constraint to avoid constantly looking up to avoid lava. pirical improvements to the designed dense reward, we pro- pose to use LLMs, named as Trajectory Analyzer, to sum- marize the historical information of the interaction between the trained agent and the environment and use it to guide the revision of the reward function. The division of labor of Reward Designer and Trajectory Analyzer allows for in- dependent operations of data analysis and reward function updates. Trajectory Analyzer does not need to know the de- tails of the reward function, and Reward Designer does not need to process complex trajectory data. Specifically, the current trained model is used to inter- 4 act with the environment and obtain K trajectories. Then, we truncate these trajectories and use a LLM to summarize the observations of the last consecutive L frames of each failed trajectory to automatically infer its possible failure reasons. Based on the analysis of the reasons for the fail- ure, the LLM Trajectory Analyzer is asked to propose key points that Reward Designer needs to consider in the next round of reward function revision. For instance, failure sce- narios where punishment is not considered, misalignment of dense reward and sparse reward causes the agent’s behavior to deviate from the final goal, etc. Figure 2 shows an example of multiple rounds of im- proving the reward function during the search for diamonds. In the first step, through analysis of the trajectory, Trajec- tory Analyzer finds that the agent would opportunistically find a shortcut to increase the reward, that is, move back and forth to deceive the reward function into thinking that the agent is moving actively. Therefore, the Reward De- signer modifies the code snippet that encourages the agent to move, i.e. encourage the agent to appear in unvisited lo- cations as much as possible. Although the initially designed reward function has taken into account the penalty for the loss of the agent’s health, the agent still cannot effectively learn to avoid lava. When modifying the reward function in the second round, Trajectory Analyzer discovers through the failed trajectory that the agent may die from lava, so it is suggested that Reward Designer increase the penalty for en- countering lava, as shown in the step 2 update in Figure 2. According to the interactive experience, Reward Designer explicitly punishes the continuous appearance of lava in the field of view. However, the excessive punishment of lava caused the agent to choose to turn its perspective upward or downward to avoid the appearance of lava in the visible range, making it impossible for the agent to continue ef- fective exploration, which deviates from the ultimate goal. To this end, Reward Designer further constrain the agent’s perspective in step 3, so that the lava disappeared from the agent’s perspective by turning left/right while continuing to search for diamonds, which is the desired strategy. Fig- ure 3(a) shows the successful trajectory of avoiding lava: The agent sees the lava after breaking the stone ahead using iron pickaxe, and then turn left to avoid the lava through the mining tunnel. 4. Experiment 4.1. Environment Setup We mainly use the harvest mode in the MineDojo [13] en- vironment to verify the model’s ability to play Minecraft. The training pseudo code of Auto MC-Reward is shown in Algorithm 1. We set up the following challenging tasks for model performance comparison and ablation study: • Explore diamond ore on the 11-th floor under- Algorithm 1 Auto MC-Reward Training Pseudo Code Require: Task (T), Inital Agent (A0), Environment (Env), Max number of Critic reviews (NCritic) Ensure: Final Agent (AN), Final Reward (RN) Summary = None Critique = None R0 = None for i = 1, . . . , N do Ri = RewardDesigner(Summary, Critique, T, Ri−1) for j = 1, . . . , NCritic do Critique, Done = RewardCritic(Ri) if Done then break else Ri = RewardDesigner(Summary, Critique, T, Ri) end if end for Ai = TrainAgent(A0, Ri, Env, T) Traji, Stati = Eval(Env, Ai) Summary = TrajectoryAnalyzer(Traji, Stati) Critique = None end for ground: Initially, the agent is equipped with an iron pickaxe on the 11-th floor underground. When the dia- mond ore is within the visible range and the distance is less than 2 distance units, the task is deemed completed. The difficulty of the task lies in the fact that diamonds are very rare, lava frequently appears during exploration, leading to death, and the maximum number of steps is limited to 60,000. When steps exceed the limit, the tra- jectory is considered failed. Long-term exploration can demonstrate the advantages of dense rewards. • Approach tree on plains biome : The task is con- sidered successful if the tree is within the agent’s vis- ible range and the distance is less than 1 distance unit. The difficulty of the task lies in the fact that the trees are very sparse on plains, which is extremely detrimental to sparse reward functions. The maximum number of steps is limited to 2,000 steps. • Approach specific animal (e.g. cow , sheep ) on plains biome : The task is considered successful if the animal is within the agent’s visible range and the dis- tance is less than 2 distance unit. The difficulty of the task is that the animals are constantly moving. The maximum number of steps is limited to 2,000 steps. • Obtaining diamond : The agent needs to complete the whole process of mining diamonds, including key be- haviors such as finding and obtaining materials on the sur- face, crafting, digging down, going back to the ground, and mining stone/iron ore/diamond ore. The tech tree is shown in Figure 4. 5 Figure 3. The trajectories of the new behaviors. (a) Avoid lava when exploring for diamond ore . (b) Attack cow in plains villages. 4.2. Implementation Details LLM Prompt. The components of the input prompts for Trajectory Analyzer include task description, game infor- mation, statistical metrics, and information on failed trajec- tories. Components of the input prompts for Reward De- signer and Reward Critic includes task description, game information, input parameters, and reward function require- ments and format. We use GPT-4 [35] for all the LLM com- ponents, and set temperature to 0.3. • Instruction: Instructions on initializing, updating and handling execution error of reward function for Reward Designer, reviewing function for Reward Critic, and ana- lyzing trajectory for Trajectory Analyzer. • Task description: The objective, initial conditions, suc- cess criteria, and task flow. For example, for the explore diamond task, the objective is \\"to find and approach a diamond, achieving a high success rate while avoiding death.\\" The initial condition is \\"agent at y level 11 with an iron pickaxe.\\" The success criteria is \\"being less than 1 meter from the nearest diamond block\\", and the task flow is \\"horizontally explore to find a diamond, face it, and approach it\\". In the task description, we do not provide prior game strategy information (task challenges, DFS ex- ploration strategies, or avoiding lava, etc.) to ensure the method’s versatility. • Game information: Game version, block names, field of view, action space, and units of measurement. Game information provides knowledge about the game’s simu- lation environment, not game strategy. • Statistical metrics and information on failed trajec- tories: success rates, and actions sequences, reward se- quences, final inventory and nearby blocks of K = 10 failed trajectories. If a trajectory exceeds L = 32 steps, it is truncated to the last 32 steps. • Input parameters: The nearest distance of each block type within the visible range in the current and previous steps, changes in inventory between adjacent steps, health points, and the agent’s location in each past step. The memory is also provided as an input parameter for storing information to monitor changes across different steps. We provide explanation and examples of the parameters in the input prompt. • Reward function requirements and format: We require the Designer to write a dense function and a sparse func- tion, and consider only the sign of the two functions’ re- turn values, not the magnitude. The detail of the scale constraints is in Section 3.1. Imitation Learning Details. When large labeled datasets do not exist, the canonical strategy for training capable agents is RL, which is inefficient and expensive to sam- ple for hard-exploration problems [3, 4, 20], e.g. mining diamond in Minecraft. Therefore, in order to more effi- ciently explore the effectiveness of the LLM-based reward function design mechanism proposed in this paper, we pre- trained some foundation models through imitation learning as done by VPT [3]. Specifically, we use GITM [52] to continuously perform Diamond Mining task and record im- portant observation data of each frame, such as RGB, ac- tion, inventory, GPS, compass, structured actions, etc. In the end, we collect about 11 million image data, totaling about 153 hours (the control frequency is 20 Hz) of game videos. Subsequently, we train these data through fully su- pervised learning by using Impala CNN [12] and Trans- former [43] as backbone, and obtained several foundation models. The main differences between the foundation mod- els are different biomes (forest and plains), temporal frames (16 and 128), and whether goal embedding is used. In sub- sequent experiments, these foundation models were used in two different purposes: 6 Table 1. Comparison with other reward methods on three Minecraft tasks.

RL Training Details. We use proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm [38] with generalized advantage estima- tion (GAE) [37] to train our RL model. We use γ = 0.99 and λ = 0.95 for all of our experiments, and the total train- ing frames is 256,000. To prevent catastrophically forget- ting or overly aggressive policy update during RL training, we follow VPT [3] to apply an auxiliary Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss between the RL model and the frozen pre-trained policy. We also normalize the reward based on the trajectory returns to constrain the gradient scales of dif- ferent tasks. See Appendix for details. 4.3. Main Results Baselines. We compare our Auto MC-Reward against the following methods: • Naive Handcraft: The agent keeps moving (and min- ing for diamond exploration task) in one direction with a small probability of turning left/right. • Imitation Learning: Our foundation model pre-trained with GITM-generated data, as introduced in Section 4.2. • RL with Sparse Reward: Use only the reward from the original environment, i.e. only receives a reward when the success criteria is completed. • RL with Curiosity Dense Reward [36]: Encourage the agent to discover and learn about parts of the environment that it has not encountered before. • RL with Self-Imitation Dense Reward [34]: Encourage the agent to replicate its past actions that led to high re- wards. • RL with MineCLIP [13] Dense Reward: Use MineCLIP to calculate the dense reward based on the sim- ilarity between RGB frames and task objectives. Results on Diamond Ore Exploration Task. For the plain imitation learning model, fitting the training data makes it lack the awareness of avoiding lava, so it often dies in lava during the search for diamonds, and only has 38.9% success rate under the limit of 60,000 steps, as shown in Ta- ble 1. In contrast, our Auto MC-Reward makes the agent realize the importance of avoiding lava by continuously im- proving the dense reward function, and the final diamond success rate has increased to 45.2% with 70% lava escape success rate. Figure 3(a) demonstrates good awareness of avoiding lava. Based on the same reinforcement learning algorithm, the disadvantages of sparse reward functions in 7 Figure 4. The tech tree of obtaining diamond. The green squares are tasks to be optimized with Auto MC-Reward, i.e. obtaining log , cobblestone , iron ore and diamond . long-horizon tasks are undoubtedly revealed. By watching the videos of collected trajectories, we find that using sparse functions often leads to irreversible behavior, such as be- ing unable to break the surrounding ores to move due to maintaining a head-up posture. Although a low death rate of 1.5% is achieved, the actual average moving distance is only 16.8, and the success rate is only 0.5%. Due to the similar scenes underground, MineCLIP cannot give differ- entiated rewards, so its performance is close to the initial imitation learning model. Other baselines, like curiosity and self-imitation dense reward, also have mediocre perfor- mance and the success rate has not been significantly im- proved. Results on Tree Approaching Task. Since trees are ex- tremely sparse on the plain, the imitation learning model and the RL model with sparse reward cannot perform well, with only 2.5% and 4.3% success rates respectively, and their average action steps are close to the maximum limit. Table 1 shows that MineCLIP dense reward receives a suc- cess rate of 65.6% since it can provide positive reward when tree is visible. Curiosity and self-imitation methods also achieve better results than imitation learning. For Auto MC- Reward, Reward Designer uses a strategy of giving positive rewards for getting closer and deducting rewards for going away, so that the agent learns to slowly approach the tar- get, ultimately achieving 73.4% success rate with only 972 average action steps. Results on Cow Approaching Task. The task of explor- ing for cows does not appear in the training data of imitation learning, so the zero-shot ability on this task is not ideal, with about 22.4% success rate and average steps close to the maximum limit. By checking the videos, we find most of the successful cases are due to good luck without inten- tion to actively approach the target. The same experimental conclusion is also obtained in the experiment of sparse re- ward function. Similar to the Tree Approaching Task, the superior dense reward function design mechanism makes our agent 43.7% (56.3% vs. 12.6%) higher than sparse re- ward, as listed in Table 1. Another dense reward MineCLIP also shows strong performance in this task, but due to the need to calculate the similarity of images and texts at all times during training, the efficiency is unacceptable. Figure 5. Cumulative success rates for 4 key items of obtaining diamond on forest and plains biomes. In terms of diamond, the performance comparison between imitation learning and Auto MC-Reward in two biomes are: 28.8% vs. 36.5%, and 0% vs. 28.1%. Results on Obtaining Diamond . We verify the pro- posed method on a more difficult task, that is, the tech tree of collecting diamonds, as shown in Figure 4. As mentioned before, our foundation imitation learning model already has a certain ability from birth to diamond mining. We use the proposed method to optimize several key tasks in the pro- cess to increase the success rate of final diamond acquisi- tion. The green parts in Figure 4 are the tasks that need to be optimized, i.e. obtaining log, cobblestone, iron ore and diamond. We conduct experiments on two biomes in Minecraft, and the cumulative success rate is shown in Fig- ure 5. Specifically, the lower death rate allows our agent to have a higher success rate in mining iron ore and dia- mond, and ultimately achieves 36.5% success rate on for- est biome, which is 7.7% higher than the imitation learning model. As for plains, the difficulty of obtaining log makes the imitation learning model unable to complete any tasks. Auto MC-Reward overcomes the difficulty of obtaining log, thus achieving a 28.1% success rate in obtaining diamonds. Table 2 provides a rough comparison of several different methods on the task of mining diamonds. We achieve a high success rate without exploiting unfair information (i.e. Lidar and Voxel) during the inference phase. 4.4. Ablation studies Effectiveness of Reward Designer. The first row of Table 3 is an RL experiment with a sparse reward function. As men- tioned before, it cannot explore diamonds normally. After adding Reward Designer, it regained the ability to explore under a dense reward function. Effectiveness of Reward Critic. As listed in Table 3, the success rate of exploring diamonds has increased from 35.1% to 40.5% by adding Reward Critic, because it can reduce the syntax and semantic errors in the code, making the training process more effective and sufficient. For exam- ple, the Trajectory Analyzer concludes that the agent died in 8 lava and asks the Reward Designer to add relevant penalties. However, without being checked by Critic for semantic er- rors, it is possible that the added code snippet uses the word \\"magma\\" instead of the correct one \\"lava\\". This will result in insufficient learning of lava avoidance, which is reflected in a 2.1% (43.1% vs. 45.2%) success rate difference. Effectiveness of Trajectory Analyzer. As observed in Ta- ble 3, Trajectory Analyzer is the key to helping the agent improve the success rate of completing tasks. It summa- rizes the reasons for failure to be fed into Reward Designer, allowing it to iteratively modify an appropriate dense re- ward function to guide the agent to overcome difficulties. In terms of Diamond Exploration Task, Trajectory Ana- lyzer provides timely feedback on the potential risks of lava, which greatly improves the survival rate and moving distance, ultimately effectively improving the success rate from 40.5% to 45.2%. 5. Conclusion We proposed Auto MC-Reward, an automated dense re- ward design framework for addressing challenges caused by sparse reward and complex environment of Minecraft. It addresses the issue of sparse rewards by leveraging LLMs to automatically generate dense reward functions, enhanc- ing learning efficiency. The system consists of three key components: Reward Designer, Reward Critic, and Trajec- tory Analyzer, which are used for the design, verification and analysis of the reward function respectively. Auto MC- Reward’s capabilities are validated through experiments, demonstrating a remarkable improvement in success rate and learning efficiency in complex tasks in Minecraft. Auto MC-Reward humbly contributes to more effective learning in complex tasks through its automated dense reward func- tion design. We hope that our proposed method can pave the way for further research in reinforcement learning and its application to real-world problems.

Experiments on Other Minecraft Tasks A.1. Environment Setup This section conducts experiments on more Minecraft tasks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed reward function design mechanism. The experiments mainly includes the approaching task of three animals including pig , sheep and chicken , as well as the attacking task of cow . • Approaching animals on plains biome. The task is considered successful if the animal is within the agent’s visible range and the distance is less than 2 distance unit. The difficulty of the task is that the animals are constantly moving and small (e.g. chicken ). The maximum number of steps is limited to 2,000 steps. • Attacking cow on plains biome. The task is considered successful if the agent successfully kills a cow and obtains beef or leather . The maximum number of steps is limited to 4,000 steps. A.2. Results Table I compares the performance between imitation learning model and ours. As the task of approaching for animals does not appear in the training data of imitation learning, our method achieves a significant improvement in success rate in fewer steps compared to imitation learning model’s zero shot. In the more difficult task of attacking cow, our method also achieves clear advantages. By further checking the videos, we find most of the successful cases are due to good luck without intention to actively approach the target. In the supplementary materials, we have prepared several demo videos, in which we can clearly see that the agent trained by our method has a clear awareness of completing the corresponding tasks.

Foundation Model Imitation Learning B.1. Pretraining Data When large labeled datasets do not exist, the canonical strategy for training capable agents is RL, which is inefficient and expensive to sample for hard-exploration problems [3, 4, 20], e.g. mining diamond in Minecraft. Therefore, in order to more efficiently explore the effectiveness of the LLM-based reward function design mechanism proposed in this paper, we pre-trained some foundation models through imitation learning as done by VPT [3]. Specifically, we use GITM [52] to continuously perform Diamond Mining task and record important observation data of each frame, such as RGB, action, inventory, compass (e.g. y_level), structured action (action plans), etc. The following is the format of the collected data: { \\"action_plans\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"mine\\", \\"args\\": { \\"object\\": {\\"log\\": 1}, \\"tool\\": None }, \\"expectation\\": \\"Obtain 1 log\\" }, ... ], \\"actions\\": [ [0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 3, 0, 0], 12 ... ], \\"y_level\\": [66, ...], \\"action_indices\\": [100, ...], \\"biomes\\": [\\"Forest\\", ...], \\"deaths\\": [0, ...], \\"visible_blocks\\": [ [ {\\"name\\": \\"wood\\", \\"nearest_distance\\": 0.71}, ... ], ... ], \\"visible_entities\\": [ [ {\\"name\\": \\"cow\\", \\"nearest_distance\\": 4.57}, ... ], ... ], \\"inventory\\": [{\\"log\\": 1}, ...], \\"task_names\\": [\\"Obtain 1 log\\", ...], \\"task_indices\\": [88, ...], } Finally, we collect approximately 20.5/5.3 million image data on forest/plains biome, as listed in Table II. To reduce training costs, we only use 9 million and 2 million image data for training and validation on forest and plains biomes, respectively, totaling about 153 hours of game video (the control frequency is 20 Hz).

Training Details Subsequently, we conduct fully supervised training on the four main tasks of the Diamond mining Task, i.e. log, cobblestone, iron ore, diamond, by using Impala CNN [12] and Transformer [43] as backbone, and obtained several foundation models. The main differences between the foundation models are different biomes (forest and plains), temporal frames (16 and 128), and whether goal and y_level embeddings are used as conditions. We use 32 A800 GPUs for foundation model training, and initialize the network using the foundation model of VPT to speed up the training of imitation learning. The hyperparameters are listed in Table IV. Table IV. Hyperparameters for imitation learning. Hyperparameter Value Learning rate 1e-4 Batch size 128 Epochs 25 Optimizer Adam The obtained foundation models, especially the goal-conditioned one, already have satisfactory basic behavioral capabil- ities. Based on these models, this paper uses the proposed methods to further improve existing behaviors (e.g. avoid lava while exploring diamond) and complete new tasks (e.g. approaching / killing animals). C. Reinforcement Learning Training We use proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm [38] with generalized advantage estimation (GAE) [37] implemented in TorchRL [5] library to train our RL model. The main hyperparameters used for RL training are listed in Table V. In addition to the above hyperparameters, several training techniques are applied to all of our experiments: • We follow VPT [3] to apply an auxiliary Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss between the RL model and the frozen pre- trained policy to prevent catastrophically forgetting or overly aggressive policy update during RL training, e.g., maintaining the ability to dig horizontal tunnels. This loss is defined as: Lkl = αKL(πpt, πθ) (1) where πθ is the the policy being trained, πpt is the frozen pretrained policy, KL(πpt, πθ)is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the policy being trained and the pretrained policy, and α is the loss weight that is set to 0.125 by default. 14 Table V.

Hyperparameter Value Learning rate 5e-5 Total training frames 256,000 Batches per iteration 64 Discount factor (γ) 0.99 GAE λ 0.95 Value pre-training iteration 2 PPO clip 0.1 Entropy loss weight 0.1 Critic loss type L2 Critic coefficient 1 Optimizer Adam • We also normalize the reward based on the trajectory returns to constrain the return scales of different tasks. The formula is as follows: R′ = mean(abs(R)) R′ cur = βR′ cur + (1 − β)R′ pre rnorm = r max(R′cur, 1) (2) where r and R are reward and trajectory returns. β is a momentum parameter, set as 0.7 by default.

D.2. Reward Designer Prompts for Reward Designer include prompts for initializing reward function, updating reward function, and handling critic failure and execution error. Prompt for Initializing Reward Function You are now a proficient Minecraft player. You should help me write proper reward functions to train a Minecraft agent with reinforcement learning to complete the described task. {task_description} Input parameters of the reward function - current_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **current step**. It is a dictionary, consisting of the names, relative distances with the agent, and relative angles (yaw and pitch) with the agent, in the form of: {NAME_1: (DIST_1, YAW_1, PITCH_1), NAME_2: (DIST_2, YAW_2, PITCH_2)}. For example, {\\"wood\\": (24.7, 1.48, -1.57), \\"cobblestone\\": (1.3, -0.17, 1.05), \\"iron_ore\\": (4.5, 0.61, -0.17)}. If a certrain block type does not exist in the field of view, it is not present in the dictionary. The yaw and pitch here is relative to the agent’s front, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent. - previou_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **previous step**, with the same format as the current_nearest_blocks. - inventory_change: the change of the agent’s inventory from the previous step to current step, in the form of a dictionary: {NAME_1: CHANGE_NUM_1, NAME_2: CHANGE_NUM_2}. Positive values mean increase and negative values mean de- crease. For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. 16 - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable. It is initialized as a dictionary. You can save necessary information between different steps with it. General game information - The version of Minecraft is 1.11. - Common block names : dirt, cobblestone, iron, diamond, wood, coal, water, air, lava, leaves, ... Collected item names are the same. - FOV is set to -35 to 35 degrees for yaw and -30 to 30 degrees for pitch. The max visible distance of blocks is 64. - Length of each block is 1 meter. - The y coordinate of the agent is the agent’s height. The larger the y, the higher the agent. The ground level is around y = 63, but is not fixed. - At each step, the agent selects one operation in is action space. The action space includes doing nothing (i.e. staying still), moving forward and backward, jumping and attacking. The action space also includes turning left, right, up and down. - The attack range is 2 meters in front of the agent. The agent can move 0.2 meters in each step. The agent can turn 15 degrees in each step. Typically, the agent needs to stay still and attack for **60 successive steps** to break a block. - The hunger value is always at the max level. Reward function requirements - You should write a dense reward function \`dense\`and a sparse reward function \`sparse\`. The sparse reward indicates achieving the goal or receiving heavy punishment. The dense reward provides intermediate signal to guide the agent in the process of achieving the goal. The magnitude of the return value does not matter, but the sign (positive or negative) is important. The final reward will be \`np.sign(sparse(...)) * 1 + np.sign(dense(...)) * 0.1\`. Output Requirements - The reward function should be written in Python 3.9. - Output the code block only. **Do not output anything else outside the code block**. - You should include **sufficient comments** in your reward function to explain your thoughts, the objective and **implementa- tion details**. The implementation can be specified to a specific line of code. - If you need to import packages (e.g. math, numpy) or define helper functions, define them at the beginning of the function. Do not use unimported packages and undefined functions. Output format Strictly follow the following format. **Do not output anything else outside the code block**. def reward_function(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): # Thoughts: # ... # (import packages and define helper functions) import numpy as np ... def dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... def sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... dense_reward = dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) sparse_reward = sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) return np.sign(sparse_reward) * 1 + np.sign(dense_reward) * 0.1 ... Now write a reward function. Then in each iteration, I will use the reward function to train an RL agent, and test it in the 17 environment. I will give you possible reasons of the failure found during the testing, and you should modify the reward function accordingly.

Positive values mean increase and negative values mean de- crease. For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. 20 - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable. It is initialized as a dictionary. You can save necessary information between different steps with it.

D.3. Reward Critic The prompt for Reward Critic judges whether the current reward function meets the requirements, and provides critique when the judgement fails. You are now a proficient Minecraft player. I will give you a reward function written in Python, which is used to train an RL agent to play Minecraft. You should help me to evaluate whether the reward function has met the requirements. {task_description} Input parameters of the reward function - current_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **current step**. It is a dictionary, consisting of the names, relative distances with the agent, and relative angles (yaw and pitch) with the agent, in the form of: {NAME_1: (DIST_1, YAW_1, PITCH_1), NAME_2: (DIST_2, YAW_2, PITCH_2)}. For example, {\\"wood\\": (24.7, 1.48, -1.57), \\"cobblestone\\": (1.3, -0.17, 1.05), \\"iron_ore\\": (4.5, 0.61, -0.17)}. If a certrain block type does not exist in the field of view, it is not present in the dictionary. The yaw and pitch here is relative to the agent’s front, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent. - previou_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **previous step**, with the same format as the current_nearest_blocks. - inventory_change: the change of the agent’s inventory from the previous step to current step, in the form of a dictionary: {NAME_1: CHANGE_NUM_1, NAME_2: CHANGE_NUM_2}. Positive values mean increase and negative values mean de- crease. For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable.

Reward function requirements - You should write a dense reward function \`dense\`and a sparse reward function \`sparse\`. The sparse reward indicates achieving the goal or receiving heavy punishment. The dense reward provides intermediate signal to guide the agent in the process of achieving the goal. The magnitude of the return value does not matter, but the sign (positive or negative) is important. The final reward will be \`np.sign(sparse(...)) * 1 + np.sign(dense(...)) * 0.1\`. Requirements 1. You should check whether the reward function meets the **reward function requirements** above. 2. Your judgement should consider whether the comments and the detailed implementation code are consistent. You can judge whether a line is correct by its comment, but do only rely on the comments. 3. You should also check the format of the reward function. It should be like: def reward_function(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): # Thoughts: # ... # (import packages and define helper functions) import numpy as np ... def dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... def sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... dense_reward = dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) sparse_reward = sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) return np.sign(sparse_reward) * 1 + np.sign(dense_reward) * 0.1 ... 4. Consider the **Information about the game state** above. 5. **You don’t need to check whether the reward function meets the task description**. 6. You should first provide a reasoning and decision. If the reward function fails, provide a critique to help to improve the reward function. Output format You should only respond in JSON format as described below: { \\"reasoning\\": \\"reasoning\\", \\"success\\": boolean, \\"critique\\": critique, } Ensure the response can be parsed by Python \`json.loads\`, e.g. no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc. Do not output anything else like explanations.

Examples of LLM-Designed Reward Functions We provide reward function examples for four tasks. For the attacking cow task, we add two extra input parameters dam- age_dealt and kill_entity, which records the amount of damage the agent caused and the amounts of each entity the agent killed, respectively.

It is a dictionary, consisting of the names, relative distances with the agent, and relative angles (yaw and pitch) with the agent, in the form of: {NAME_1: (DIST_1, YAW_1, PITCH_1), NAME_2: (DIST_2, YAW_2, PITCH_2)}. For example, {\\"wood\\": (24.7, 1.48, -1.57), \\"cobblestone\\": (1.3, -0.17, 1.05), \\"iron_ore\\": (4.5, 0.61, -0.17)}. If a certrain block type does not exist in the field of view, it is not present in the dictionary. The yaw and pitch here is relative to the agent’s front, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent. - previou_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **previous step**, with the same format as the current_nearest_blocks. - inventory_change: the change of the agent’s inventory from the previous step to current step, in the form of a dictionary: {NAME_1: CHANGE_NUM_1, NAME_2: CHANGE_NUM_2}. Positive values mean increase and negative values mean de- crease. For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. 32 - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable. It is initialized as a dictionary. You can save necessary information between different steps with it. General game information - The version of Minecraft is 1.11. - Common block names : dirt, cobblestone, iron, diamond, wood, coal, water, air, lava, leaves, ... Collected item names are the same. - FOV is set to -35 to 35 degrees for yaw and -30 to 30 degrees for pitch. The max visible distance of blocks is 64. - Length of each block is 1 meter. - The y coordinate of the agent is the agent’s height. The larger the y, the higher the agent. The ground level is around y = 63, but is not fixed. - At each step, the agent selects one operation in is action space. The action space includes doing nothing (i.e. staying still), moving forward and backward, jumping and attacking. The action space also includes turning left, right, up and down. - The attack range is 2 meters in front of the agent. The agent can move 0.2 meters in each step. The agent can turn 15 degrees in each step. Typically, the agent needs to stay still and attack for **60 successive steps** to break a block. - The hunger value is always at the max level. Reward function requirements - You should write a dense reward function \`dense\`and a sparse reward function \`sparse\`. The sparse reward indicates achieving the goal or receiving heavy punishment. The dense reward provides intermediate signal to guide the agent in the process of achieving the goal. The magnitude of the return value does not matter, but the sign (positive or negative) is important. The final reward will be \`np.sign(sparse(...)) * 1 + np.sign(dense(...)) * 0.1\`. Requirements 1. You should check whether the reward function meets the **reward function requirements** above. 2. Your judgement should consider whether the comments and the detailed implementation code are consistent. You can judge whether a line is correct by its comment, but do only rely on the comments. 3. You should also check the format of the reward function. It should be like: def reward_function(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): # Thoughts: # ... # (import packages and define helper functions) import numpy as np ... def dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... def sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA): ... dense_reward = dense(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) sparse_reward = sparse(current_nearest_blocks, previous_nearest_blocks, inventory_change, health, past_agent_positions, GLOBAL_DATA) return np.sign(sparse_reward) * 1 + np.sign(dense_reward) * 0.1 ... 33 4. Consider the **Information about the game state** above. 5. **You don’t need to check whether the reward function meets the task description**. 6. You should first provide a reasoning and decision. If the reward function fails, provide a critique to help to improve the reward function. Output format You should only respond in JSON format as described below: { \\"reasoning\\": \\"reasoning\\", \\"success\\": boolean, \\"critique\\": critique, } Ensure the response can be parsed by Python \`json.loads\`, e.g. no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc. Do not output anything else like explanations.

Reasons of Failure and Inefficiency: In one of the failed trajectories, the agent died due to lava. The agent did not take any action to avoid the lava or move away from it. The agent should be programmed to detect and avoid dangerous blocks, such as lava, by turning or moving in a different direction. Suggestion on Game Strategy: Train the agent to detect and avoid dangerous blocks, such as lava or deep holes. The agent should be programmed to prioritize safety and avoid situations that could lead to death or loss of health. By implementing the suggestion and improving the agent’s training, the success rate of finding diamonds can be increased. ——————————————————————————————————————————————– DESIGNER INPUT: You are now a proficient Minecraft player. I now have a reward function to train a Minecraft agent with reinforcement learning to complete the described task. The reward function is used to train the reinforcement learning agent for several times. I will provide you the analysis of failure and inefficiency and suggestions. You should help me modify the reward function. Task description - Objective: Find and approach diamond with higher success rate and avoid death. - Initial Status: 1. The agent is under ground at y level 11, the most common level to find diamonds. 2. The agent already has an iron pickaxe. - Success criteria: The distance to the nearest diamond block is less than 2 meter. - Procedure: Explore horizontally to find a diamond, face it and approach it. Input parameters of the reward function - current_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **current step**. It is a dictionary, consisting of the names, relative distances with the agent, and relative angles (yaw and pitch) with the agent, in the form of: {NAME_1: (DIST_1, YAW_1, PITCH_1), NAME_2: (DIST_2, YAW_2, PITCH_2)}. For example, {\\"wood\\": (24.7, 1.48, -1.57), \\"cobblestone\\": (1.3, -0.17, 1.05), \\"iron_ore\\": (4.5, 0.61, -0.17)}. If a certrain block type does not exist in the field of view, it is not present in the dictionary. The yaw and pitch here is relative to the agent’s front, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent. - previou_nearest_blocks: nearby block types and nearest distance of each block type at the **previous step**, with the same format as the current_nearest_blocks. 44 - inventory_change: the change of the agent’s inventory from the previous step to current step, in the form of a dictionary: {NAME_1: CHANGE_NUM_1, NAME_2: CHANGE_NUM_2}. Positive values mean increase and negative values mean de- crease. For example, {\\"wood\\": 2, \\"dirt\\": 3, \\"stone_pickaxe\\": -1}. - health: an integer value in range 0 to 10 indicating the health level of the agent. 0 means death and 10 means full health. - past_agent_positions: the history of location of agent, in the form of a list: [[x1, y1, z1, yaw1, pitch1], [x2, y2, z2, yaw2, pitch2], ...]. The yaw and pitch here are relative to the agent’s initial forward direction, i.e., pitch = 0 and yaw = 0 is the front of the agent when it was born. The length of the list is the number of steps the agent has taken. The last element of the list is the current location of the agent. - GLOBAL_DATA: a global variable. It is initialized as a dictionary. You can save necessary information between different steps with it. General game information - The version of Minecraft is 1.11. - Common block names : dirt, cobblestone, iron, diamond, wood, coal, water, air, lava, leaves, ... Collected item names are the same. - FOV is set to -35 to 35 degrees for yaw and -30 to 30 degrees for pitch. The max visible distance of blocks is 64. - Length of each block is 1 meter. - The y coordinate of the agent is the agent’s height. The larger the y, the higher the agent. The ground level is around y = 63, but is not fixed. - At each step, the agent selects one operation in is action space. The action space includes doing nothing (i.e. staying still), moving forward and backward, jumping and attacking. The action space also includes turning left, right, up and down. - The attack range is 2 meters in front of the agent. The agent can move 0.2 meters in each step. The agent can turn 15 degrees in each step. Typically, the agent needs to stay still and attack for **60 successive steps** to break a block. - The hunger value is always at the max level. Reward function requirements - You should write a dense reward function \`dense\`and a sparse reward function \`sparse\`. The sparse reward indicates achieving the goal or receiving heavy punishment. The dense reward provides intermediate signal to guide the agent in the process of achieving the goal. The magnitude of the return value does not matter, but the sign (positive or negative) is important. The final reward will be \`np.sign(sparse(...)) * 1 + np.sign(dense(...)) * 0.1\`.

The business has grown in recent months, and Sam wants to expand her reach by selling ice cream online. However, her existing IT infrastructure is limited and not equipped to handle online sales. Sam needs a solution that can help her manage online sales and inventory while also providing her with the flexibility to scale the business in the future. Currently, the business manages its inventory, sales, and customer data through an on-premise system that requires significant investment in hardware and software. The system is also prone to downtime, which can lead to a loss of revenue and customer trust. The business needs a solution that can scale with its growth and provide reliable access to data. Instructions Your task is to brainstorm and come up with at least two possible azure cloud solutions that Sam can implement to address her business challenges. For each solution, explain how it can benefit Sam's business. To complete this exercise, you will need access to an internet connection for research and Microsoft Word to draft your proposed solutions. If you do not have the Microsoft Word application, you can use Free Office for the web . This version of Office allows you to view and edit files in apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. This service is available to anyone with a Microsoft account. Step 1: Review the challenges Identify and review the challenges mentioned in the case study to understand Sam's current IT infrastructure limitations, the need to manage online sales and inventory, and the requirement for a solution that can scale with the business growth. Step 2: Identify solutions Brainstorm at least two possible cloud solutions that Sam can implement to address her business challenges. Step 3: List the benefits For each solution, explain how it can benefit Sam's business and what potential challenges it might pose. Consider factors such as cost, scalability, security, and reliability. Additionally, highlight the benefits of implementing cloud transformation.","completion":"Solution 1: Implementing Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) and Azure SQL Database By adopting Azure Virtual Machines and Azure SQL Database, Sam can move her on-premise system to the cloud. This solution provides several benefits: 1. Scalability: Azure VMs can easily scale up or down based on user demand, allowing Sam to adjust resources as the business grows. This flexibility ensures that the system can handle increased online sales and inventory management without any downtime or performance issues. 2. Reliability: Azure Virtual Machines offer a high level of uptime and reliability since they are hosted in Microsoft's data centers. This ensures that Sam's online sales and inventory management system is always accessible to her and her customers, reducing the risk of revenue loss and maintaining customer trust. 3. Cost-effectiveness: By moving to the cloud, Sam can reduce her hardware and software investment costs. Azure VMs eliminate the need for on-premise servers and the associated maintenance and upgrade expenses. Similarly, Azure SQL Database eliminates the need for Sam to manage her own database infrastructure. 4. Security: Azure provides robust security mechanisms to protect Sam's data. Azure Virtual Machines and Azure SQL Database offer built-in security features, such as encryption, firewalls, and access control, which help protect sensitive customer and inventory information. However, there are a few potential challenges with this solution: 1. Migration complexity: Moving the existing on-premise system to the cloud might require additional effort and time for migration. Sam will need to plan the transition carefully and ensure that the migration process does not disrupt her daily business operations. 2. Learning curve: Sam and her employees may need some training to get accustomed to the new cloud-based system and its management. However, this can be mitigated by providing proper training and support during the transition. Solution 2: Implementing Azure App Service and Azure Cosmos DB Alternatively, Sam can consider implementing Azure App Service and Azure Cosmos DB for her online sales and inventory management system. This solution offers the following benefits: 1. Scalability: Azure App Service allows Sam to easily scale her application as the business grows. She can adjust resources to handle increased online sales and inventory management without worrying about performance issues. 2. Cost-effectiveness: Azure App Service eliminates the need for Sam to manage and maintain her own servers, reducing hardware and maintenance costs. Azure Cosmos DB, a globally distributed database service, also eliminates the need for Sam to manage her own database infrastructure. 3. Reliability: Azure App Service and Azure Cosmos DB are built to provide high availability and reliability. Sam can trust that her system will be up and running with minimal downtime, ensuring uninterrupted access to sales and inventory data. 4. Security: Azure App Service and Azure Cosmos DB offer robust security features, including encryption, firewalls, and access controls. Sam can be confident that her customer and inventory data will be protected against potential threats. However, there are a few potential challenges with this solution: 1. Application compatibility: Sam's existing on-premise system might need to be modified or rewritten to be compatible with Azure App Service. She would need to ensure that this transition does not introduce any compatibility issues or disrupt her daily business operations. 2. Database design: Migrating to Azure Cosmos DB might require redesigning the database schema and updating the application code. This could involve additional effort and time. Sam would need to plan accordingly and ensure that the migration process is smooth and efficient. In conclusion, both solutions offer scalability, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and security benefits for Sam's business. However, the choice between Azure Virtual Machines and Azure SQL Database or Azure App Service and Azure Cosmos DB depends on factors such as the complexity of the existing system, migration requirements, and Sam's preferences."},{"prompt":"write the kahide helaki prema","completion":"The phase \\"kahide helaki prema\\" seems to be in Odia, an Indian language, and it translates to \\"how to express love\\" or \\"how do I express love\\" in English. Here is a description of what that might entail: Expressing love (prema) can be done in numerous ways, and it often depends on the individuals involved as well as the cultural context. Here are some general ways to express love: 1. **Words of Affirmation**: Using the power of words to affirm your feelings can be incredibly potent. Simple phrases like \\"I love you,\\" \\"You mean so much to me,\\" or \\"I cherish the time we spend together\\" can convey deep emotions. 2. **Acts of Service**: Doing things for the person you love, which could include helping them with tasks or taking care of them when they are sick, are practical demonstrations of love. 3. **Gift Giving**: Sometimes, a thoughtful gift can speak volumes about your feelings towards someone. It doesn't have to be expensive or grand; often, the most meaningful gifts are those that show you have paid attention to their likes and dislikes. 4. **Quality Time**: Spending time together, engaging in meaningful conversations, or participating in shared hobbies or interests can strengthen the bond and show your dedication to the relationship. 5. **Physical Touch**: Hugs, kisses, holding hands, and other forms of physical affection are powerful expressions of love for many people. 6. **Listening**: Actively listening and being present when your partner is talking can demonstrate that you value and care about their thoughts and feelings. 7. **Support and Encouragement**: Supporting your loved one in their goals, dreams, and even during challenging times conveys that you believe in them and their capabilities. It is important to note that everyone has their own preferred way of giving and receiving love, often referred to as \\"love languages.\\" Understanding your own and your partner's love languages can help tailor the expression of love in a way that will be most appreciated and recognized. In any relationship, communication is key. It's essential to discuss and understand each other's needs and find mutually satisfying ways to show love and affection."},{"prompt":"why you do not know odia","completion":"As an artificial intelligence language model, I don't \\"know\\" or \\"learn\\" languages in the same way that humans do.

The lesson plan serves as a road map for the instructor, outlining the objectives, structure, and methodology of the teaching session. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you create a lesson plan: 1. Identify Learning Objectives: - Determine what you want the students to learn by the end of the lesson. - Objectives should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). 2. Set the Lesson Context: - Provide background information and the relevance of the lesson to previous knowledge. 3. Determine Necessary Materials: - List all the resources and materials you will need, such as textbooks, handouts, technology, etc. 4. Plan the Time: - Estimate how much time each part of the lesson will take and plan accordingly. - Be flexible and ready to adapt if some parts take more or less time than expected. 5. Decide on the Lesson Structure: - Start with an introduction to engage and focus students. - Progress to the body of the lesson where new information is presented. - End with a conclusion that summarizes key points, or a Q&A session. 6. Choose Teaching Methods: - Decide on the most effective teaching strategies for your objectives (e.g., direct instruction, discussion, collaborative learning, hands-on activities). 7. Plan for Assessment: - Create tools to assess whether students have met the learning objectives (e.g., quizzes, projects, oral presentations, class participation). 8. Design Learning Activities: - Devise activities that provide opportunities for students to practice and apply what they've learned. - Consider different learning styles and diverse learners. 9. Incorporate Differentiation: - Adjust activities, assignments, and assessments to cater to the different needs, interests, and abilities of your students. 10. Plan for Classroom Management: - Think about the rules, routines, and procedures that will support a successful learning environment. - Prepare strategies to deal with potential disruptions. 11. Include a Reflection Component: - Reserve time for yourself to reflect on the effectiveness of the lesson and to note any changes you might make in the future. When creating your lesson plan, always keep your students in mind. What are their interests and abilities? How can you make the material engaging and accessible to them? Remember, a lesson plan is a guide, not a script. Be ready to change your plan as you go along to meet the needs of your students or adapt to the day's dynamics. It's also important to align your lesson plans with the curriculum standards and frameworks that apply to your subject and grade level. This ensures that you meet the educational requirements and goals set forth by your school or district."},{"prompt":"Write about crossing over","completion":"Crossing over is a vital genetic process that occurs during meiosis, which is the type of cell division required for producing gametes—sperm and eggs—in sexually reproducing organisms. The purpose of crossing over is to increase genetic diversity among offspring, which is one of the key elements of the success and adaptability of species through generations. During meiosis, a diploid cell (a cell with pairs of chromosomes, one from each parent), will eventually divide to create haploid cells (cells with a single set of chromosomes). This process involves two rounds of cell division: meiosis I and meiosis II. Crossing over occurs in prophase I, a stage of meiosis I. Here's a detailed look at how crossing over occurs: 1. **Homologous Chromosome Pairing**: Early in prophase I, the DNA has already been replicated, and the chromosomes begin to condense. Each chromosome lines up with its respective homologous partner, forming what is known as a tetrads or bivalents (four chromatids together). 2. **Synapsis**: The homologous chromosomes undergo synapsis, which means they pair up precisely, aligned gene by gene, across their entire length. 3. **Formation of the Synaptonemal Complex**: A protein structure known as the synaptonemal complex forms between the homologous chromosomes, holding them tightly together along their lengths. 4. **Crossing Over Event**: While the homologous chromosomes are paired up, they may swap equivalent pieces of DNA. This is facilitated by a group of proteins that cut the DNA at the same position on both homologs and then reconnect the cut ends to the opposite chromosomes. These proteins include endonucleases such as the Spo11 protein, and repair enzymes that mediate the exchange. 5. **Chiasmata Formation**: The physical manifestation of the crossing over event is called a chiasma (plural: chiasmata). It’s the point where the homologous chromosomes remain connected after exchanging genetic material. 6. **Result of Crossing Over**: The result is that portions of homologous chromosomes are exchanged, and the resultant chromosomes are a new combination of paternal and maternal genetic information. Crossing over is important for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it creates new combinations of alleles (variations of genes) on a chromosome. This diversity is beneficial as it presents a wide variety of genetic combinations within a population, some of which may give an individual an advantage under specific environmental conditions. Secondly, by shuffling alleles during sexual reproduction, it also makes populations more resilient to diseases and other changes in their environment because at least some individuals are likely to possess genetic combinations that allow them to survive and reproduce. The frequency and precise locations of crossing over events are, in part, random, but there are also preferences for points along the chromosome where crossing over is more likely to occur. This randomness in the genetic shuffle is why siblings (except for identical twins) share a mix of traits from both parents but are unique from each other."},{"prompt":"write an story about childhood","completion":"Once upon a time, in a peaceful village nestled between the rolling hills and whispering woods, there lived a young boy named Charlie. His world was filled with wide-eyed wonder, where every pebble was a treasure and each new day promised adventures untold. Charlie's house was a cozy cottage at the end of a cobbled lane where the lilacs bloomed with abandon each spring. Inside this house, laughter blended with the aroma of freshly baked bread and the warmth of a crackling hearth. His best friend was a scruffy dog named Skipper, an ever-faithful companion with whom he explored every nook and cranny of the village and the untamed lands beyond. Together, they embarked on countless quests – to find the oldest tree in the forest, to catch a glimpse of the shy deer that danced in the meadows at dawn, and to construct the mightiest of forts from branches and forgotten planks. Charlie's parents owned a small general store where they sold everything from penny candies to porcelain dolls. The bell above the door jingled merrily whenever visitors came, and Charlie often helped out by counting out change or drawing special signs for the window display. Every Saturday, Charlie and his father visited the village library, a grand old house filled with books of every color and size. The librarian, Mrs. Potts, with her silver hair always knotted neatly in a bun, knew the perfect stories to whisk little minds away to distant lands and times. Charlie would leave with an armful of books, each one a portal to a different realm, each night a new adventure. Summers were spent swimming in the creek, where the water ran cool and clear and the fish darted like flecks of living gold. He and his friends would have contests to see who could skip a stone the farthest, their laughter ringing through the trees like a melody composed by the wind. In autumn, the village transformed into a tapestry of fiery reds, ochres, and yellows. Charlie would help with the harvest, picking apples from Mr. Jensen's orchard, and later, making cider that tasted of sunlight and joy. Halloween was a much-anticipated affair, with costumes paraded through the streets and Jack-o'-lanterns grinning from every porch. As winter's chill cloaked the village, Charlie and his friends would pull on their heaviest boots and softest scarves to frolic in the snow. They built snowmen with carrot noses and coal-smile, had snowball fights, and when the lake froze over, they'd skate until their cheeks were rosy and their fingers numb, only to be revived by cups of cocoa by the fireside. When spring returned, with its promise of renewal, Charlie would lie in the fields watching the clouds drift by, imagining them as dragons, ships, and castles in the sky. His heart was full of dreams, and every petal and raindrop whispered secrets only children seem to hear. Charlie's childhood was a tapestry woven with threads of simplicity, joy, innocence, and the kind of magic that doesn’t fade with age. It shaped him in ways big and small, leaving an indelible mark on who he would become. And even as the years passed and Charlie grew up, the memories of those golden days in his beloved village, with Skipper by his side and the world open and ripe for exploration, remained with him, like a cherished story that never grows old, ready to be recounted to the next generation of wide-eyed dreamers."},{"prompt":"create a story about horror move","completion":"In the heart-ridden town of Duskhollow, a legend whispered through trembling lips spoke of The Harvest Moon House, a dilapidated mansion that clawed at the edge of reality. For generations, the townsfolk avoided the path leading to its gates, crossed themselves when they dared to utter its name, and even the bravest of souls dared not to tread near it after the sun kissed the horizon farewell. Jenna, a young and ambitious filmmaker captivated by the macabre, decided that The Harvest Moon House was the perfect setting for her breakout horror film. She gathered her crew: Alex, the skeptical cinematographer; Lisa, the tenacious sound engineer; Marco, the special effects wizard; and Darren, the lead actor whose charm only rivaled his daring. Upon their arrival, the house loomed in silent accusation, its decaying façade punctuated by the gnarled branches of dead trees, the sky above a brooding canvas of ominous clouds. The crew felt a chill worming its way beneath their skins, a silent warning that went unheeded in the face of their growing excitement. Jenna insisted they begin filming immediately. As the cameras rolled, Darren recited lines that echoed eerily through the hollow halls, stirring dust and something... else. The air grew thick, and Lisa swore she heard whispers tangle with the static in her headphones. Alex's camera flickered with shadows that shouldn't exist, and Marco's fake blood curdled as if afraid of the house itself. Night encompassed the house like a shroud as the crew settled in, the bravado of daylight fading into caution. Jenna, thrilled with the day's footage, proposed a séance for authenticity's sake. The others reluctantly agreed, drawn by the gravity of Jenna's ambition and the unspoken knowledge that skepticism was a luxury that the night within Harvest Moon House could ill-afford. They huddled around a creaking table, hands clasped, and Jenna called to the spirits. At first, only silence answered. But as the candlelight flickered and the house groaned, an invisible weight descended upon the room. A voice, dry as dead leaves, whispered from the corners — words unintelligible but intent, imbued with malice. Panic ignited within the crew, but Jenna was entranced, pushing further, desperate to capture this unknown horror on film. The room temperature plummeted, breaths turned to mist, and Darren's eyes rolled back as if strings puppeted his body from within. Terrified, the crew watched helplessly as he spoke in tongues. The camera captured it all — the rising fear, the spectral wind that thrashed against the windows, the flickering lights. But as the climax of supernatural rage crescendoed, something unwanted breached the mortal plane. A figure materialized, its form blotched with the rot of ages, its eyes a hollow grief that hungered for warmth it could never reclaim. Marco was the first to break, screaming for escape. The crew bolted, equipment abandoned, as the entity pursued. Sprinting through echoing corridors beset with moving portraits and bleeding walls, they found themselves disoriented, the house consuming sanity and direction alike. Jenna, her ambition now turned to ravenous survival, saw the house’s perversion — the game it played using hope and terror. Her film, the record of their impending doom, lay forgotten beneath the gaze of the restless camera’s unblinking eye. After an eternity of chase, the crew tumbled out into the clawing grasp of the night, The Harvest Moon House's doorway slamming shut behind them, a silent edict that forbade return. They looked upon one another, freed yet shackled by the memory of what they had witnessed. They left Duskhollow and never spoke again of that night, their bonds severed by the truth of what they had almost become—footage for a horror movie within The Harvest Moon House's voracious archives. Their film was left behind, a cinematic masterpiece—that no living soul would dare to watch. And within the house, behind doors that opened to no one, the entity waited, yearning, for the next foolish dreamers to step within its ageless game."},{"prompt":"create questions for a educational syclogy","completion":"1.

It comes above genus and below order. In biological classification, known as taxonomy, living organisms are categorized into a hierarchical structure. Here's a breakdown from broadest to narrowest categories: - Domain - Kingdom - Phylum (or Division for plants) - Class - Order - Family - Genus - Species Each family can contain one or more genera (plural of genus), and each genus contains one or more species. This system helps biologists and researchers to organize and categorize the immense diversity of life on Earth according to their evolutionary relationships. In the Odia language, which is an Indian language spoken in the state of Odisha, \\"family\\" translates to \\"ପରିବାର\\" or \\"paribāra\\". Odia is an Indo-Aryan language and the term \\"paribāra\\" is used to refer to a family in a social context, which typically includes parents, children, and can extend to a broader kinship group in the cultural setting."},{"prompt":"write about st. joshep","completion":"St. Joseph, often referred to as Saint Joseph, is a figure in Christianity who is most widely recognized as the earthly father of Jesus Christ and the husband of the Virgin Mary. Despite his significant role in the life of Jesus, the New Testament provides limited information about Joseph's life, and much of what is known comes from tradition or apocryphal texts. In the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, Joseph is described as a righteous man who hailed from the lineage of King David. He lived in Nazareth and worked as a carpenter. When he discovered that Mary was pregnant, despite them not yet living together, he considered divorcing her quietly to save her from public shame. However, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, explaining that Mary's conception was by the Holy Spirit and that the child would be the Savior. Joseph, following the angel's command, took Mary as his wife and named the child Jesus, as instructed. Joseph is venerated as a saint in the Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran traditions. He is the patron saint of carpenters, fathers, workers, travelers, immigrants, and the Universal Church, among other things. His feast days are celebrated on March 19th, known as St. Joseph's Day, and May 1st, known as the Feast of St. Joseph the Worker. St. Joseph's character is an example of fidelity, humility, and obedience to God's will. He is honored for his role as a protector and provider for Mary and Jesus, especially during their flight to Egypt to escape King Herod's massacre of the innocent young male children in Bethlehem. His silent presence in the Gospels—never quoted as saying anything—has led to a deep spiritual tradition highlighting his quiet strength, righteousness, and role as a model for Christian fatherhood. Artistic depictions of St. Joseph often show him with carpenter's tools or with the young Jesus, and many churches and shrines are dedicated to his memory around the world. It is essential to note that while Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions, as well as Protestant denominations that recognize saints, hold St. Joseph in high esteem, the specifics of his life beyond what is described in the Bible are often filled in with traditional stories that may vary between communities and traditions."},{"prompt":"what do you mean by growth in Odia","completion":"In Odia, the term \\"growth\\" translates to \\"ବୃଦ୍ଧି\\" (bruddhi). Growth can refer to the increase in size, number, value, or strength. Depending on the context, it can be used to describe various types of growth, such as economic growth (ଅର୍ଥନୈତିକ ବୃଦ୍ଧି), population growth (ଜନସଂଖ୍ୟା ବୃଦ୍ଧି), physical growth (ଶାରୀରିକ ବୃଦ୍ଧି), or even personal growth and development (ବୈୟକ୍ତିକ ବୃଦ୍ଧି).

Among the major levels of classification, family is one level below \\"order\\" and one level above \\"genus.\\" Organisms within a family share a set of similar characteristics and are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor. Each class contains multiple orders, each order contains multiple families, each family contains multiple genera (plural of genus), and each genus contains one or more species. Here's an example to illustrate this hierarchy: - Class: Mammalia (mammals) - Order: Carnivora (carnivorous mammals) - Family: Felidae (cats) - Genus: Panthera (big cats like lions, tigers) - Species: Panthera leo (lion) In this example, \\"Felidae\\" is the family level classification within the class of mammals for cats and related species. This structuring allows scientists and researchers to understand the relationships and characteristics that define different groups of organisms. The system of taxonomy was developed by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century and has been refined over time as our understanding of genetics and evolutionary biology has advanced."},{"prompt":"write about one story geeta in odia","completion":"ଗୀତା ଏକ ସନାତନ ହିନ୍ଦୁ ଧର୍ମଗ୍ରନ୍ଥ ଅଟେ, ଯାହାକୁ ପ୍ରାୟଶଃ \\"ഭഗവദ്ഗിത\\" ବା କେବଳ \\"ଗୀତା\\" ଭାବରେ ଜଣା ଯାଏ। ଏହା ଏକ ପାଵନ ଗ୍ରନ୍ଥ ଅଟେ ଏବଂ ଏହାର ଅଂଶ ମହାଭାରତ କାବ୍ୟର ଭୀଷ୍ମ ପର୍ବ ରେ ଅବସ୍ଥିତ ଅଟେ। ଯାହାକୁ ହିନ୍ଦୁ ଦର୍ଶନ ଏବଂ ଆଧ୍ୟାତ୍ମିକ ଚିନ୍ତନର ବିକାଶର ଏକ ମହତ୍ଵପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣ ଶିଖାର ବୋଲି ମାନ୍ଯାଏ। ସଂକ୍ଷିପ୍ତ କଥା ଯଦି କୁହିବା ଯାଏ, ଗୀତା ହେଉଛି କୌରବ ଏବଂ ପାଣ୍ଡବ ସେନାମଧ୍ୟରେ ଯୁଦ୍ଧ ପୂର୍ବରୁ ଅର୍ଜୁନ ଏବଂ ତାଙ୍କର ସାରଥି ଭଗବାନ୍ କୃଷ୍ଣ ମଧ୍ୟରେ ହୋଇଥିବା ଏକ ଗୂଢ଼ ଏବଂ ଅଧ୍ୟାତ୍ମିକ ସଂଵାଦ। ଅର୍ଜୁନ ଯୁଦ୍ଧ ପ୍ରତି ତୀବ୍ର ମନସ୍ତାପ ଏବଂ ସଂଶୟ ଅନୁଭବ କରେ, କିନ୍ତୁ କୃଷ୍ଣ ଗର୍ହଣଯୋଗ୍ୟ କର୍ମ ଏବଂ ଧର୍ମ୍ମର ସହଜ ବୋଧର ପ୍ରତି ନିଜ କର୍ତବ୍ୟ ବିଶ୍ୱାସ କରାଇ ଅର୍ଜୁନଙ୍କୁ ପରିଚାଳନା କରନ୍ତି। ଗୀତାର ଅଂଶବିଶେଷ \\"ଭଗବତ ଗୀତା\\" ରୁ ନିମ୍ନଲିଖିତ ହୋଇଛି: ଭଗବଦ୍ ଗୀତାରେ ମୁଖ୍ୟ କିଛି ଶିକ୍ଷା ହେଲା: - କର୍ମ ୟୋଗ: କର୍ତବ୍ୟନିଷ୍ଠା ଏବଂ କର୍ମଫଳର ଆସକ୍ତିରୁ ମୁକ୍ତ ଥାଇ କର୍ମ କରିବା - ଭକ୍ତି ୟୋଗ: ଭଗବାନ୍ କୁ ନିଷ୍ଠାବାନ ଭକ୍ତିରେ ସମର୍ପିତ ହେବା - ଜ୍ଞାନ ୟୋଗ: ଆଧ୍ୟାତ୍ମିକ ଜ୍ଞାନ ଏବଂ ଅନୁଭୁତି ମାଧ୍ୟମରେ ଆତ୍ମସାକ୍ଷାତ୍କାର ପ୍ରାପ୍ତି - ରାଜ ୟୋଗ: ମନର ସଂଯମ ଏବଂ ଧ୍ୟାନଧାରଣା ସହ ଆତ୍ମଶୁଦ୍ଧି \\"ଭଗବଦ୍ ଗୀତା\\"ର 18 ଅଧ୍ୟାୟ ରେ ଅନେକ ଶ୍ଲୋକ ଅଛନ୍ତି, ଏବଂ ପ୍ରତିଟି ଶ୍ଲୋକ ଜୀବନର ଗୂଢ଼ ଅର୍ଥ ଏବଂ ସତ୍ୟ ବୋଧରେ ପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣ। ଏହା ହିନ୍ଦୁ ଧର୍ମର ଅତି ମାର୍ଗଦର୍ଶନମୂଳକ ଗ୍ରନ୍ଥ ମଧ୍ଯରେ ଏକ। (ଉପରୋକ୍ତ ଲେଖା ଗୀତାର ସଂକ୍ଷିପ୍ତ ପରିଚୟ ବା ଅନୁକ୍ରମଣିକା ଭଳି। ଯଦି ଆପଣ ଓଡିଆରେ ଗୀତା ସଂପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣ କଥା ପଢିବାକୁ ଚାହେଁଥିବେ, ଓଡିଆ ଅନୁବାଦ ସହିତ ମୂଳ ଶ୍ଲୋକର ଏକ ସଂସ୍କରଣ ଖୋଜ ପାଇ ଜଣେ।)"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Классическая поэзия обогащает человека своим лирическим опытом. обладает врачующими свойствами. А вот культурный человек - это не тот, кто много читал классических произведений, много слушал классическую музыку, а тот, который обогатился всем этим, которому открылась глубина мысли прошедших веков, душевная жизнь других, который многое понял и, следовательно, стал терпимее к чужому, стал это чужое понимать.

Par conséquent, il n'est pas possible de fournir des informations précises sur les différences entre GPT-3 et un modèle hypotétique GPT-4. GPT-3, ou Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, est la troisième itération du modèle de langage développé par OpenAI. Il est reconnu pour ses capacités à générer du texte de manière cohérente et contextuellement appropriée, comprendre et répondre de manière détaillée à des questions, traduire des langues, résoudre certaines tâches de raisonnement, et même écrire du code à un niveau de base, entre autres applications. Voici ce que l'on pourrait attendre théoriquement d'une version GPT-4, basée sur les tendances d'évolution des modèles de langage de OpenAI : 1. Taille et complexité : GPT-4 serait probablement plus grand en termes de paramètres que GPT-3, ce qui pourrait permettre une meilleure compréhension du langage et une capacité à modéliser des interactions plus complexes. 2. Efficacité : Avec les avancées continues dans le développement des algorithmes et l'architecture des réseaux de neurones, GPT-4 pourrait être conçu pour être plus efficace, c'est-à-dire qu'il pourrait générer des réponses de meilleure qualité sans une augmentation proportionnelle de la puissance de calcul par rapport à GPT-3. 3. Compréhension et génération du langage: On s'attendrait à ce que GPT-4 améliore la capacité de compréhension du langage naturel et les capacités de génération de texte, potentiellement démontrant une meilleure contextualisation et une connaissance du monde plus riche. 4. Robustesse et fiabilité : Des mécanismes pour rendre le modèle moins sujet aux erreurs et plus fiable dans ses réponses pourraient être mis en place, ainsi que des mesures pour atténuer les biais présents dans les réponses ou les données d'entraînement. 5. Interfaces de programmation (API) et applications : Si GPT-4 était mis à disposition par OpenAI, il serait probablement accompagné d'API plus avancées et d'applications spécialisées pour différentes industries ou domaines d'utilisation. 6. Mesures de sécurité : Avec l'augmentation de la puissance des modèles, les inquiétudes concernant les abus tels que la désinformation et la génération de contenu inapproprié augmentent également. GPT-4 pourrait donc inclure des mesures de sécurité et d'usage éthique plus strictes. Rappelez-vous, les points ci-dessus sont hypothétiques et basés sur là où la communauté de recherche pourrait potentiellement diriger le développement de la prochaine génération de modèles de traitement du langage naturel.

It involves structuring the content and activities to facilitate learning for students at a particular skill level. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you prepare an effective lesson plan: **Step 1: Determine your objectives** Before you start preparing your lesson, you need to know what you aim to achieve. Your objectives should be clear, measurable, and attainable, and they should align with the overall curriculum and standards for the grade level or proficiency of the students you're teaching. **Step 2: Know your students** Understand the level of your students’ language skills, their interests, their learning styles, and any other special needs they might have. This knowledge will help you tailor your lesson to their abilities and keep them engaged. **Step 3: Choose your topic** Pick a topic that is relevant and interesting to your students, and suitable for their English proficiency level. You can choose anything from grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing, listening, speaking, or a combination of these. **Step 4: Set learning goals** Define what students should be able to do by the end of the lesson. These goals should align closely with the lesson’s objectives and be gauged using the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). **Step 5: Plan your resources** Decide what materials and resources you will need for the lesson, including any textbooks, handouts, audio-visual aids, or technology you will use. **Step 6: Structure your lesson** Outline the structure of your lesson, typically consisting of the following parts: - *Warm-up*: An activity to engage students and prepare them for the lesson. This could be a simple discussion question, a short game, or a review of previous material. - *Introduction*: Present the new topic and set the scene for the lesson. Clearly state the lesson’s goals to the students. - *Presentation*: Teach the new material. This could involve explaining new concepts, modeling sentences or structures, or providing examples. - *Practice*: Offer controlled practice activities that allow students to use the new language in a focused way. This is typically done through exercises, worksheets, or specific tasks. - *Production*: Encourage students to use the language more freely and creatively through activities such as role-plays, discussions, or writing tasks. - *Assessment*: Include some form of assessment to check for understanding and whether the lesson objectives have been met. - *Conclusion*: Review the lesson objectives with the students, summarize what has been learned, and give feedback. **Step 7: Differentiate your instruction** Plan activities that cater to different learning styles and levels of proficiency, ensuring that all students can learn effectively. **Step 8: Plan for assessment** Decide how you will assess the students' understanding of the material. This may include quizzes, oral presentations, writing tasks, or informal assessments like observing students during activities. **Step 9: Reflect on your lesson** After you teach the lesson, set aside time to reflect on how it went. What worked well? What didn't? How can you improve it for next time? Reflection is a crucial aspect of teaching that can help you develop and refine your lesson plans for future use. Remember that while this is a guideline, flexibility is key. Be prepared to adjust your lesson plan as you gauge the students’ needs and responses throughout the lesson."},{"prompt":"WHO IS THE BOYFRIEND OF RASMIKA MANDAnna","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff in April 2023, Rashmika Mandanna, the Indian actress known for her roles in Telugu and Kannada films, has not publicly disclosed her relationship status or the name of her boyfriend.

There are two forms of reproduction: asexual and sexual. Asexual reproduction involves a single organism or cell dividing, budding, or splitting into two or more new individuals. Genetic material from only one parent is present and the offspring are, typically, identical to the parent, known as clones. This type of reproduction is common among some single-celled organisms, plants, and certain animals. Sexual reproduction, on the other hand, involves the combination of genetic material from two parents to create offspring with a mix of traits from both. In sexual reproduction, male and female gametes, sperm and eggs respectively, fuse during fertilization to form a zygote. This zygote develops into a new organism with a unique set of genes. The mixing of genes contributes to the genetic diversity of populations, which can influence their ability to adapt to changing environments. The mechanisms, behaviors, and strategies involved in reproduction are complex and diverse across the kingdom of life, reflecting the adaptive responses of organisms to their environments and contributing to the perpetuation of species."},{"prompt":"write the song of major hindi move","completion":"Certainly, India has a rich tradition of film music, and one of the most renowned songs from Hindi cinema is \\"Mere Desh Ki Dharti\\" from the film \\"Upkar\\" (1967).

These rules together make up, i.e., constitute, what the entity is. In the case of countries, this is the basic legal framework that outlines the rights and duties of citizens and the powers of the government, and it is the highest legal authority which all other laws are derived from and must comply with. A constitution often includes: 1. The principles of the political and legal systems of a country. 2. The structure of government and the rights of the government institutions. 3. The process for making and amending laws. 4. The rights and liberties afforded to individuals. 5. The distribution of power among the different branches of government, typically the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary. Constitutions can be written or unwritten. A written constitution is a formal document that defines the nature of the political system, the structure and powers of government and its constituent parts, and the rights of citizens. In contrast, an unwritten constitution consists of different pieces of legislation, court cases, and conventions that collectively provide guidelines for the governance of the country. In countries like the United States, the Constitution is the supreme law of the land; no other laws can contradict it. Any law found to be in violation of the Constitution can be struck down by the judiciary. In Indian context, the Constitution of India, which came into effect on January 26, 1950, is the supreme law of the country and lays down the framework that demarcates fundamental political code, structure, powers, and duties of government institutions, and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. It is the longest written constitution of any sovereign nation in the world."},{"prompt":"in hindi","completion":"संविधान किसी राज्य या संगठन के संचालन के लिए निश्चित किए गए मौलिक सिद्धांतों या स्थापित प्रथाओं का एक समूह होता है। ये नियम मिलकर, उस संस्था को जो यह होती है उसके रूप में परिभाषित करते हैं। देशों के मामले में, यह बुनियादी कानूनी ढाँचा होता है जो नागरिकों के अधिकारों और कर्तव्यों को रेखांकित करता है और सरकार की शक्तियों को बताता है, और यह सर्वोच्च कानूनी प्राधिकारी होता है जिससे अन्य सभी कानूनों को निकलना पड़ता है और जिसका पालन करना अनिवार्य होता है। संविधान में अक्सर निम्नलिखित शामिल होते हैं: 1. देश की राजनीतिक और कानूनी प्रणालियों के सिद्धांत। 2. सरकार की संरचना और सरकारी संस्थानों के अधिकार। 3. कानून बनाने और संशोधित करने की प्रक्रिया। 4. व्यक्तियों को दिए गए अधिकार और स्वतंत्रताएँ। 5. सरकार की विभिन्न शाखाओं में सत्ता का वितरण, आमतौर पर कार्यकारी, विधायी, और न्यायिक। संविधान लिखित या अलिखित हो सकता है। एक लिखित संविधान एक औपचारिक दस्तावेज होता है जो राजनीतिक प्रणाली की प्रकृति, सरकार की संरचना और उसके घटकों की शक्तियों, और नागरिकों के अधिकारों को परिभाषित करता है। इसके विपरीत, एक अलिखित संविधान विभिन्न कानूनों, अदालती मामलों, और सम्मेलनों का एक संग्रह होता है जो देश के शासन के लिए सामूहिक दिशानिर्देश प्रदान करता है। जैसे कि संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका में, संविधान भूमि का सर्वोच्च कानून है; कोई अन्य कानून इसके विरुद्ध नहीं जा सकता। कोई भी कानून जो संविधान का उल्लंघन करता है, उसे न्यायपालिका द्वारा खारिज किया जा सकता है। भारतीय संदर्भ में, भारतीय संविधान, जो 26 जनवरी 1950 को प्रभावी हुआ, देश का सर्वोच्च कानून है और यह उस ढाँचे को निर्धारित करता है जो मौलिक राजनीतिक कोड, संरचना, सरकारी संस्थानों की शक्तियाँ और कर्तव्यों को चिन्हित करता है, और यह मौलिक अधिकार, नीतिनिर्देशक सिद्धांतों और नागरिकों के कर्तव्यों को प्रस्तुत करता है। यह दुनिया के किसी भी संप्रभु राष्ट्र का सबसे लंबा लिखित संविधान है।"},{"prompt":"shayari for momi dadi brother","completion":"Certainly, here is a shayari for \\"mom\\" (माँ), \\"dadi\\" (दादी), and \\"brother\\" (भाई) in Hindi: **माँ के लिए:** माँ तू है दया की देवी, तेरी ममता की कोई सीमा नहीं। मेरी हर खुशी, हर ग़म में, तेरा साथ निभाया हर कदम में। **दादी के लिए:** दादी की कहानियों में पलकर, बचपन जैसे ख्वाबों में ढल गया। उनकी उँगली थामे चलते-चलते, जीवन का सफर आसान हो गया। **भाई के लिए:** भाई मेरा रक्षक, मेरा साथी, तेरी बंदगी में मुझको बल मिलता है। तेरे बिना ये दुनिया सुनी, तेरे साथ में, हर पल खुशनुमा होता है। शायरी भावनाओं का सुंदर आदान-प्रदान होती है और ये कुछ लाइनें उस खास जज्बात को आपके परिवार के लिए समर्पित करती हैं।"},{"prompt":"translaite in Odia","completion":"Certainly, here are the shayaris translated into Odia for \\"mā'ā\\" (ମାଆ), \\"dadi\\" (ଦାଦୀ), and \\"bhai\\" (ଭାଇ): **ମା' ପାଇଁ:** ମାଆ, ତୁମେ ଦୟାର ଦେବୀ, ତୁମର ମମତାର କୌଣସି ସୀମା ନାହିଁ। ମୋର ସମସ୍ତ ଆନନ୍ଦ, ଦୁ:ଖ ମଧ୍ୟରେ, ତୁମେ ସାଥି ଦେଲା ପ୍ରତି ପଦକ୍ଷେପରେ। **ଦାଦୀ ପାଇଁ:** ଦାଦୀଙ୍କ କାହାଣୀରେ ବଢ଼ ହୋଇ, ବାଲ୍ୟ ଯେନିକି ସ୍ୱପ୍ନରେ ମିଶି ଯାଇଛି। ତାଙ୍କ ଆଙ୍ଗୁଳି ଧରି ଚାଲିବାରେ, ଜୀବନର ପଥ ସହଜ ହୋଇସାରିଛି। **ଭାଇ ପାଇଁ:** ଭାଇ ମୋର ରକ୍ଷକ, ମୋର ସାଥୀ, ତୁମର ସାଥୁ ରେ ମୁଁ ଶକ୍ତି ପାଉଛି। ତୁମର ବିନା ଏ ଦୁନିଆ ସୂନା, ତୁମ ସାଥୁରେ, ପ୍ରତି ମୁହୁର୍ତ୍ତ ସୁନ୍ଦର ହୋଇଯିବ। ଶାୟରୀ କାବ୍ୟାତ୍ମକ ଭାବସାର ଶୈଳୀ ହୋଇଥାଏ, ଏବଂ ଉପରୋକ୍ତ ଲାଇନଗୁଡିକ ଆପଣଙ୍କ ପରିବାରର ଖାସ୍ ଅନୁଭୂତିକୁ ସମର୍ପଣ କରେ।"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Bobby was known throughout the village for his kind heart and adventurous spirit. He had a mop of untamed curly hair that danced with the wind, and his eyes sparkled with curiosity. Bobby spent his days exploring the countryside, befriending every creature he met, from the tiny beetles crawling through the underbrush to the majestic horses grazing in the fields. However, there was one place Bobby had never ventured into—the dense forest that bordered the village, locally known as Whispering Woods. Whispering Woods was wrapped in mystery and tales of enchantments. The adults often spoke of whispering spirits and shimmering lights that guided lost travelers. Bobby's imagination was set ablaze with stories of hidden treasure and ancient ruins lying deep within the forest. One day, Bobby could contain his curiosity no longer. With a handmade wooden sword for bravery and a small backpack filled with snacks and a trusty compass, he decided to venture into the Whispering Woods. As he entered, the forest seemed to close in behind him, muffling the sounds of the village. He felt the pulse of the woods, each rustle and chirp a symphony to the magic that lingered in the air. Undeterred, Bobby pushed on, the soft moss beneath his feet and the chorus of the leaves above guiding him deeper into the forest. Hours passed, and the sunlight filtered through the canopy in golden streams. Suddenly, Bobby stumbled upon a clearing where an old willow tree stood, its branches heavy with years and wisdom. As he approached, the willow's leaves rustled softly, and a gentle voice whispered, \\"Brave traveler, what seeks thee in these ancient woods?\\" Bobby, with wide-eyed wonder, replied, \\"I seek the heart of the forest and the stories it holds.\\" \\"The heart you seek beats within you, young one. The stories are but reflections of the courage and kindness you bring forth,\\" the willow whispered back. The wind picked up, and the leaves danced, revealing a path that led towards a gentle stream glistening with sunlight. Bobby followed the path and found the stream. There, shimmering under the water's surface, was a cluster of smooth stones, each one engraved with symbols of peace, love, and courage—the true treasures of Whispering Woods. Realizing that the riches of the forest were not gold or jewels but the timeless virtues that connect all living things, Bobby felt a warmth in his chest. With a heart full of gratitude, he gathered a few stones to share the magic with his village. As evening approached, Bobby found his way out of the woods, guided by the same mysterious lights the villagers spoke of. He emerged from the forest as the sun set, painting the sky in fiery hues—a young boy wiser and richer in spirit. Bobby became a storyteller, often seen sitting beneath the village's great oak tree, recounting his magical journey to anyone willing to listen. From then on, the Whispering Woods were no longer feared but cherished, and Bobby's tale inspired many others to seek the magic that lies within and around them.

Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016, and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States. She is able to display more than 50 facial expressions. Sophia was created by Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics. The robot is designed to learn and adapt to human behavior and work with humans and has been interviewed around the world. Sophia uses artificial intelligence, visual data processing, and facial recognition. She also utilizes voice recognition technology from Alphabet Inc. (the parent company of Google) and is designed to get smarter over time. Her AI is programmed to learn, adapt to the preferences of the people she interacts with, as well as to simulate human conversations and emotions. Sophia has the capability to process visual data, recognize faces, and maintain social interactions with humans. She has cameras in her eyes combined with computer algorithms that allow her to see faces, make eye contact, and recognize people. In October 2017, Sophia became the first robot to receive citizenship from a country, being awarded Saudi Arabian citizenship. This controversial move sparked a global conversation about the rights and status of artificial intelligence in society. Sophia has been showcased in many high-profile interviews and appearances, which sometimes involve her speaking with other robots or engaging in simple conversations with human hosts. Although Sophia is one of the most sophisticated humanoid robots to date and represents a significant leap in AI and robotics technology, it's important to note that she is not sentient. Her interactions are often more about demonstrating current AI capability than having fully autonomous conversations or understanding. Overall, Sophia is a significant development in robotics and AI and is often used by Hanson Robotics as a public symbol of the potential future of AI and robotics in society."},{"prompt":"what's your name","completion":"I am an artificial intelligence known as OpenAI's language model, specifically the ChatGPT variant.

It's a good start, but there are some points you might consider reviewing and improving: 1. Error Handling: - When an error occurs during \`fs.readFile\`, your script assumes the error is because the lock file doesn't exist. However, other errors can occur (e.g., permission issues). You should check the specific error code to ensure you are handling the case correctly. 2. Process Killing Logic: - Before killing a process, you should ensure that it is the actual process that you expect to be associated with the lock file. The PID could have been reused by the operating system for an entirely different process after the previous process terminated. - Process.kill might throw an exception if the process does not exist or if there are insufficient permissions. Add a try-catch block around this call to handle such scenarios gracefully. 3. Redundant 'readline' requires: - The 'readline' module is already required at the top of the script, but then required again within the \`promptUser\` method. This redundancy can be removed. 4. Lock Removal Before Process Exit: - You might consider automatically removing the lock when the process exits, using the \`process.on('exit', handler)\` event, to handle cases where the process shuts down unexpectedly. 5. User Prompt for Killing Process: - A hardcoded prompt for input can be limiting. It would be better if you could pass a callback to handle user interactions, or use an event-emitter pattern to allow more flexibility in user interface handling. 6. Timed Lock Acquisition: - When acquiring the lock, you wait for a specified timeout and retry a certain number of times. However, there's no exit condition in the loop if the lock is never acquired. Consider breaking out of the while loop if the \`timeout\` has been reached (currently, you only log an error but still proceed in the loop). 7. Checking if Process is Running: - The \`isProcessRunning\` method might fail on some systems, especially when run by users without proper permissions. It would be good to document this behavior or handle different permission scenarios. 8. Signals and Process Environment: - Have in mind the cross-platform considerations, as signals like 'SIGTERM' might not have the same behavior on non-Unix platforms, such as Windows. 9. Asynchronous Writes and Application Logic: - \`fs.writeFile\` is asynchronous. You'd typically want to wait until the lock file is fully written before proceeding with the application logic. However, in this class, you're not providing a method to ensure your main application logic only runs after the lock is successfully acquired. In conclusion, the LockManager is functional but could benefit from better error handling, system interaction considerations, and flexibility in user prompts. Ensuring robustness in scenarios like improper shutdowns or permission issues can improve the reliability of your locking mechanism."},{"prompt":"Is this fine now const fs = require('fs').promises; const path = require('path'); const process = require('process'); class LockManager { constructor(fileName) { this.lockFilePath = path.join(__dirname, fileName); this.lockAcquired = false; this.pid = process.pid; } async checkLock() { try { const lockData = await fs.readFile(this.lockFilePath, 'utf8'); const storedPid = parseInt(lockData.trim(), 10); if (isNaN(storedPid)) { console.error('Error: Invalid PID found in the lock file.

Let's take another look to ensure robustness and versatility: 1. Improved Error Handling: - The check to see whether the 'ENOENT' error code was received in \`checkLock\` is now correctly only assuming the lock file doesn't exist when encountering this specific error code. This is a standard method to handle file not found errors in Node.js. 2. Safe Process Killing and Error Handling: - The try-catch block added around \`process.kill\` in \`checkLock\` method is properly handling potential exceptions thrown when attempting to terminate the process. It is still necessary to ensure that you're attempting to kill the correct process that matches your application, as the PID in the lock file may have been reallocated to a different process after the initial process terminated. 3. Permission Issues and Signals: - There is no additional handling provided for permission issues or signal inconsistencies across platforms, particularly for non-Unix platforms like Windows. You may still want to catch and handle permission-related errors specifically and note that your script might experience difficulties on non-POSIX systems. 4. Application Logic after Lock Acquisition: - The \`createLock\` function now properly acquires the lock before proceeding with the application logic. However, this function merely sets an internal flag rather than providing a clear method or indication for the consumer of this class to know that it's safe to proceed with dependent operations (unless they frequently check the \`this.lockAcquired\` flag externally). 5. Automatic Lock Cleanup: - There is still no mechanism such as \`process.on('exit', handler)\` implemented to remove the lock file automatically when the Node.js process exits, which would be useful in handling unexpected terminations. 6. Lock Acquisition Timeout Handling: - The implementation now has a timeout feature. However, the loop only exits when the maximum number of retries is reached, not when the timeout is exceeded. Consider adding a \`break\` or altering the loop condition to exit if \`timeout\` has been exceeded. 7. Redundancy in \`require\` Calls: - The repetitive \`require\` of the \`readline\` module within the class method \`promptUser\` has not been addressed. You should still remove that redundancy since \`readline\` was required at the file scope originally. 8. Cross-Platform Considerations: - The code still does not provide cross-platform signal handling, which may not be critical with the current functionality but is something to consider if the code will be run on different operating systems. 9. Programming Conventions and Best Practices: - The usage of process exit codes is good practice. You may want to consider using standard exit codes from a predefined list to make it easier for other parts of a system to understand what each exit code means. 10. Cleanliness: - The code could benefit from more comments to describe the purpose and behavior of each function within the class. This helps other developers (or your future self) understand the intent and usage of the code. The class now includes better error handling and has more robust functionality for lock file management. To further improve the class, consider addressing all the points above, ensuring it handles all scenarios as expected while providing clarity for future maintainability."},{"prompt":"updated const fs = require('fs').promises; const path = require('path'); const process = require('process'); class LockManager { constructor(fileName) { this.lockFilePath = path.join(__dirname, fileName); this.lockAcquired = false; this.pid = process.pid; } async checkLock() { try { const lockData = await fs.readFile(this.lockFilePath, 'utf8'); const storedPid = parseInt(lockData.trim(), 10); if (isNaN(storedPid)) { console.error('Error: Invalid PID found in the lock file.

The logic will continue trying to acquire the lock indefinitely, even though an error message is logged after timeout. You should include a \`break\` statement or change the loop's condition to end the loop when time is out. \`\`\`javascript // Example modification for timeout if (timeout !== Infinity && Date.now() - startTime > timeout) { console.error('Error: Lock acquisition timed out. Unable to acquire the lock. Exiting.'); break; // Add this to break out of the loop } \`\`\` 2. ***Robust Process Killing***: - The revised code still lacks a safeguard against the potential mishap of killing the wrong process. PIDs can be recycled by the operating system, and without confirmation that the process holding the PID matches the one you expect (such as by comparing the command line arguments), there is a risk. If possible, record additional identifying information in the lock file and check that before deciding to kill the process. 3. ***Consolidate Requires***: - You've fixed the redundant 'require' by moving the \`readline\` to the top level. However, I don't see it in the code snippet provided. Please ensure that modules are required once at the top of the file to make the dependencies clear and to avoid potential issues with repeated loading. 4. ***Improved Exception Messaging***: - If you're not going to handle different types of exceptions individually, at least report them accurately in the logs to make troubleshooting easier. For instance, if there are permission issues when trying to write the lock file, reporting \`Unable to acquire the lock due to permission issues.\` can guide a user or developer more quickly to a solution. 5. ***Automatic Lock Cleanup***: - It would be beneficial to implement a mechanism to automatically remove the lock file upon process exit. Use the \`process.on('exit', handler)\` or \`process.on('SIGINT', handler)\` and \`process.on('SIGTERM', handler)\` events to catch termination signals and clean up properly. 6. ***Dependency on POSIX Signals***: - The reliance on POSIX signals like SIGTERM limits the cross-platform capabilities of your script, as these may not function as expected on non-UNIX platforms such as Windows. Consider checking the platform using \`process.platform\` and implementing platform-specific process termination methods if necessary. 7. ***Testing and Documentation***: - Make sure to thoroughly test your class under various scenarios to ensure the behavior is consistent and reliable. Also, document each method's behavior so that users of your class understand how to implement it properly. 8. ***Graceful Termination***: - When you attempt to kill a process using \`SIGTERM\`, consider implementing a fallback timeout that tries to kill the process with \`SIGKILL\` if it doesn't exit within a reasonable time frame. 9. ***User Prompts***: - The user prompt for killing an existing process may not suit every use case (like running in a non-interactive environment). It would be a good idea to have a non-interactive mode or configuration option that avoids user prompts and uses a default action. Once these additional points are addressed, the class should be more robust and versatile for managing lock files and ensuring that only one instance of a Node.js application can run at a time."},{"prompt":"const fs = require('fs').promises; const path = require('path'); const process = require('process'); class LockManager { constructor(fileName) { this.lockFilePath = path.join(__dirname, fileName); this.lockAcquired = false; this.pid = process.pid; } async checkLock() { try { const lockData = await fs.readFile(this.lockFilePath, 'utf8'); const storedPid = parseInt(lockData.trim(), 10); if (isNaN(storedPid)) { console.error('Error: Invalid PID found in the lock file.

This version introduces a timeout for killing the previous instance, which is an excellent addition. However, there are still a few issues and potential improvements to consider: 1. **Event Handling on Process Exit**: The intention with the 'exit' event doesn't seem to be well integrated. You're listening for a global exit event that should be belonging to the process being killed, but it actually belongs to the current process. Make sure you have a method for tracking whether the other process has exited, possibly by polling periodically or by having a more sophisticated inter-process communication method. 2. **Process Monitoring**: PID recycling is still not addressed. As mentioned previously, you may need to verify the process you are killing is actually the instance of your application. Storing and comparing other information (e.g., command line arguments, process title) could provide more security against killing an unrelated process. 3. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: This code will now attempt to forcefully kill the old process with \`SIGKILL\` after a timeout. However, keep in mind that signal handling is still POSIX-specific, and managing processes on Windows is different. If you intend to also support Windows, you'll need to incorporate different methods for terminating processes. 4. **Breaking Out Timeouts**: The \`createLock\` method still doesn't break from the while loop when the timeout is exceeded. After logging the timeout error, you might want to \`break\` from the loop to prevent additional retries. 5. **Automatic Lock Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on process exit, \`SIGINT\`, or \`SIGTERM\` is still not implemented. Consider adding something like this: \`\`\`javascript process.on('exit', () => this.removeLock().catch(console.error)); process.on('SIGINT', () => { this.removeLock().catch(console.error); process.exit(2); }); process.on('SIGTERM', () => { this.removeLock().catch(console.error); process.exit(15); }); \`\`\` This code will attempt to clean up the lock file when the process exits normally or is interrupted by a signal. Improve the error handling as appropriate for your use case. 6. **Promises and Async Handling**: Your code is mostly well-structured regarding promises and async functions. Just ensure that where you use async await, you are ready to handle potential unhandled promise rejections. 7. **Error Messages and Codes**: Using specific exit codes for different failure conditions can simplify understanding the cause of a program's termination. Remember to handle edge cases and be mindful about robustness and reliability, this involves both writing code that works well in the \\"happy path\\" scenario and being defensive against possible issues. Lastly, continue thorough testing of the code in various scenarios (e.g., file system permission issues, multiple simultaneous lock attempts, forced application closures) to ensure it behaves as expected before relying on it in production environments."},{"prompt":"const fs = require('fs').promises; const path = require('path'); const process = require('process'); class LockManager { constructor(fileName) { this.lockFilePath = path.join(__dirname, fileName); this.lockAcquired = false; this.pid = process.pid; // Flag to track if the other process has exited this.otherProcessExited = false; } async checkLock() { try { const lockData = await fs.readFile(this.lockFilePath, 'utf8'); const storedPid = parseInt(lockData.trim(), 10); if (isNaN(storedPid)) { console.error('Error: Invalid PID found in the lock file.

The method \`waitForOtherProcessExit\` is also introduced, which is a positive step towards improving the robustness of the lock management. Here are some additional considerations and fixes you could apply: 1. **Consistency and Style**: - You might want to keep the style of your code consistent. For instance, ensure that the positioning of braces \`{}\` and the use of semicolons \`;\` are consistent across the file. 2. **Exit Conditions and Error Codes**: - When exiting the process due to errors, consider using standard exit codes and possibly make them constants to make the code more readable. For example, you can define \`const EXIT_INVALID_PID = 1;\` at the top and use it like \`process.exit(EXIT_INVALID_PID);\`. - When a process exits normally after a user decides not to kill an existing process, consider using \`process.exit(0);\` which is the standard for a successful exit. 3. **waitForOtherProcessExit Method**: - This method is now responsible for checking whether the other process has exited, but there is still no graceful handling for the situation when other process does not exit. The execution will continue to \`checkLock\` method and it could potentially lead to a race condition. If you're using a timeout to wait for a process to exit, make sure that you also handle a failure to terminate the process appropriately, by informing the user, logging, and deciding how to proceed based on your application's needs. 4. **Windows Compatibility**: - The \`waitForOtherProcessExit\` method is polling process viability using \`process.kill(pid, 0)\`, which is POSIX specific. You'll need to test that this works on Windows, or you might need to look into a cross-platform solution for checking if a process is running. 5. **Cleanup on Exit**: - As mentioned before, you may want to ensure lock file cleanup when the process exits normally, as well as handling interruption signals. This might prevent leftover lock files should your process be interrupted. 6. **Error-Handling Within Promises**: - As you're using both async/await and promises (with \`.catch()\`), consider having a consistent error-handling strategy. For instance, when using \`await\`, you might want to wrap calls in try/catch blocks to handle errors. Your \`LockManager\` class is structured to be quite practical for single-instance use cases on a POSIX system, but it's crucial to handle all cases, including different platforms and unexpected process terminations. Always assume that things can go wrong and prepare your code to handle such situations gracefully.

Here are a few more potential improvements and thoughts for further polish: 1. **Consistency and Style**: - Maintain consistency in your code formatting. For example, use consistent commenting, capitalization of log messages, and code structuring. While the code's function is unaffected, a consistent style can help with readability and maintainability. 2. **Process Shutdown Hook**: - Implement a shutdown hook that attempts to release the lock when the process exits normally or through signals. Example: \`\`\`javascript process.on('exit', () => this.removeLock().catch(console.error)); process.on('SIGINT', () => { this.removeLock().catch(console.error); // Properly exit Node.js process after handling SIGINT process.exit(130); // Exit code for Ctrl-C is 130 }); process.on('SIGTERM', () => { this.removeLock().catch(console.error); // Properly exit Node.js process after handling SIGTERM process.exit(143); // Exit code for SIGTERM is 143 }); \`\`\` 3. **Error Handling in \`waitForOtherProcessExit\`**: - You're handling potential errors when checking if the process is running by logging them. You might also want to consider what should happen next after an error is caught. For instance, should the function attempt to proceed, retry, or fail immediately? 4. **Windows Compatibility**: - Ensure compatibility with Windows by potentially checking \`process.platform\` and adapting the \`isProcessRunning\` and kill logic accordingly. Some Node.js modules can aid in cross-platform process management. 5. **Avoiding Magic Numbers**: - Use constants for your timeout and retry values, and consider making them configurable through the class constructor or through other means. This makes it easier to adjust these settings as needed and avoids the magic number anti-pattern. 6. **Ensuring 'isProcessRunning' is Reliable**: - Continue to ensure that \`isProcessRunning\` is reliable for your use case. This method still assumes Unix-like behavior, which may not be compatible with non-Unix systems like Windows. 7. **Readability and Maintainability**: - Commenting on complex areas of your code can increase maintainability. Make sure to add descriptive comments especially for parts of the code like asynchronous loops, process management, and cleanup procedures. With these considerations in hand, the code seems to be approaching a fully functional state.

It looks clean and functionally complete for a POSIX compliant system. However, there are still some aspects that can be considered for improvement or clarification: 1. **Signal Handling and Cleanup**: The code snippet provided does not contain the process signal handling and the lock file cleanup upon exiting. You should implement clean up operations to remove the lock file when the process exits intentionally (e.g., completed task) or unintentionally (e.g., got killed). 2. **waitForOtherProcessExit Method**: The \`waitForOtherProcessExit\` method does not prompt the user nor take action to kill the other process. If that's intentional and the method's purpose is only to wait passively, this behavior must be clearly documented so it's not expected to behave differently. Otherwise, if the intention is to kill the existing process, you would need to restore the function that handles user interaction or automatic process termination. 3. **Windows Compatibility**: Signal handling with \`process.kill(pid, 0)\` is a UNIX-specific approach and may not behave as expected on Windows systems. If cross-platform compatibility is crucial for your application, you will need to research and implement an alternative method for checking if a process is running on Windows. 4. **Error Handling**: In the \`waitForOtherProcessExit\` method, when catching an error, the loop continues to run until the timeout. Depending on the error, you might want to break out of the loop as the error may be unrecoverable and should not be ignored. 5. **Logging and Comments**: The code could benefit from more thorough comments describing the behavior of each method and its purpose. Good in-code documentation is crucial for maintainability and understanding by other developers or your future self. 6. **Removal of the \`otherProcessExited\` Flag**: The \`otherProcessExited\` flag appears to be unused outside of the context of the \`waitForOtherProcessExit\` method. Unless there's a reason to retain the result of that method for future reference, you could consider removing the flag and limiting the exit state scope to the method where it's used. 7. **Exit Codes and Constants**: As mentioned earlier, using well-defined constants for exit codes can improve readability and maintainability. Consider defining them as constants near the top of your module. By incorporating these further improvements, you'll ensure that your LockManager is robust and easier to maintain.

If cross-platform compatibility is crucial for your application, you will need to research and implement an alternative method for checking if a process is running on Windows.","completion":"To achieve cross-platform compatibility when checking if a process is running, especially on Windows, you may need to use platform-specific tools or modules as Node.js does not provide a universal method to do this. Here are a few approaches: 1. **Using \`child_process\` Module (Windows Compliant)**: You can utilize the \`child_process\` module to execute a system command that checks for the presence of a process. On Windows, the \`tasklist\` command can be used. \`\`\`javascript const { exec } = require('child_process'); function isProcessRunning(pid) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { if (process.platform === 'win32') { // Windows command to check for process by PID exec(\`tasklist /FI \\"PID eq {pid}\\"\`, (err, stdout, stderr) => { if (err) { return reject(err); } // If the output contains \\"No tasks\\", the process is not found resolve(stdout.includes(pid.toString())); }); } else { // POSIX systems can use process.kill try { process.kill(pid, 0); resolve(true); } catch (error) { // Error code 'ESRCH' means process not found resolve(error.code === 'ESRCH' ? false : true); } } }); } \`\`\` Remember to adjust the usage of the \`isProcessRunning\` call to accommodate that it now returns a Promise and handle it with \`await\` or \`.then()\` chains appropriately. 2. **Platform-Specific Modules**: There are Node.js modules available that can abstract some of the platform-specific differences when working with processes. A module like \`ps-node\` can be used to look up processes and could potentially provide a cross-platform solution. \`\`\`javascript const ps = require('ps-node'); function isProcessRunning(pid) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ps.lookup({ pid: pid }, (err, resultList) => { if (err) { throw new Error( err ); } if (resultList.length > 0) { // Process is running resolve(true); } else { // Process is not running resolve(false); } }); }); } \`\`\` You would need to install the \`ps-node\` package via npm or yarn (\`npm install ps-node\` or \`yarn add ps-node\`) to use it in your application. Please note that using external commands or third-party modules can come with their own set of drawbacks, including performance considerations and additional dependencies to manage.

This is a step in the right direction for making your \`LockManager\` more platform-independent. Let's review the updated code: 1. **\`isProcessRunning\` Method**: - The \`isProcessRunning\` method has been correctly converted into a Promise-based method. Make sure that anywhere this method is used in the class, it is awaited correctly since it's now an asynchronous operation. 2. **Error Handling in \`isProcessRunning\`**: - Having \`throw new Error(err);\` inside the \`ps.lookup\` callback will cause an unhandled promise rejection if \`ps.lookup\` encounters an error. It's better to use \`reject(err);\` instead of throwing an error to reject the promise correctly. - Also, be sure to reject the promise with a new \`Error\` object, since \`err\` might not always be an instance of \`Error\`, depending on how \`ps-node\` handles its error messages. 3. **Using \`ps-node\` module throughout**: - Your \`checkLock\` function still uses the original POSIX \`process.kill()\` approach to terminate another process. Be aware that this won't work on Windows for signals other than \`SIGTERM\`. If you need to support Windows, consider other methods for terminating processes that don't involve UNIX signals. 4. **Documentation and Comments**: - The \`waitForOtherProcessExit\` method was updated to break out of the loop for specific errors, which is good for handling unrecoverable situations. Make sure that the comments/documentation in your code reflect this logic change and provide clear guidance on the behavior. 5. **Testing**: - It’s crucial that you test the \`LockManager\` on all target platforms (POSIX and Windows) to ensure that the cross-platform functionality is working as expected. 6. **Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup**: - The code snippet provided does not show implementation for graceful shutdown and cleanup using signal handlers as previously suggested (\`process.on('exit', handler)\` and similar). Implement these to ensure that the lock file is removed when the process exits. 7. **\`checkLock\` Method**: - The \`checkLock\` function is engaging the user with a prompt. Since you are supporting cross-platform functionality, ensure any user interaction is handled gracefully in headless environments (such as a server without terminal access). 8. **Integrate with Dependency Injection or Configuration**: - Consider integrating the \`ps-node\` module through dependency injection or configuration to make testing and future changes easier. This also enables you to switch out process monitoring libraries if better solutions become available or for platform-specific optimizations. By addressing these considerations, your \`LockManager\` will be more resilient, maintainable, and adaptable to a broad range of environments.

Here is an example of how you might implement this: \`\`\`javascript async promptUser(question, timeout = 5000) { const readline = require('readline').createInterface({ input: process.stdin, output: process.stdout }); // Create a promise that resolves with the user input const userInputPromise = new Promise((resolve) => { readline.question(question, answer => { readline.close(); resolve(answer.trim()); }); }); // Create a timeout promise const timeoutPromise = new Promise((resolve) => { setTimeout(() => { readline.close(); // It's important to close the readline interface if timeout occurs resolve('yes'); // Default to 'yes' if the user fails to respond }, timeout); }); // Race the promises and return the one that resolves first return Promise.race([userInputPromise, timeoutPromise]); } \`\`\` Then, call the \`promptUser\` function like this: \`\`\`javascript const userInput = await this.promptUser( 'Another instance is already running (PID: ' + storedPid + '). Do you want to kill it and start a new one? (yes/no) ' ); \`\`\` Since you've implemented a default value after the timeout, you can use \`userInput\` directly in the condition that follows as the result of \`promptUser\` will now be immediately used whether the user responds or not. Remember to test your updated method to ensure it behaves as expected, including handling both the case where the user responds and when the timeout is reached. Testing methods with timeouts can be tricky, as you need to make sure the test framework's timers are synchronized with your application code. In Jest, you might use fake timers with \`jest.useFakeTimers()\` and \`jest.advanceTimersByTime()\` to manipulate time in your tests. With these changes, your application will kill the old process by default if the user doesn't respond within 5 seconds."},{"prompt":"FAIL src/tests/lockmanager.test.js (10.828 s) LockManager createLock ✕ should create a lock file when it does not exist (3 ms) ✓ should retry creating the lock file when an error is encountered (103 ms) ✕ should fail to create a lock after maximum retries (5003 ms) createLock with timeout ✕ should fail to create a lock due to timeout (502 ms) removeLock ✓ should remove the lock file when called (1 ms) ✓ should output an error if removing the lock file fails (1 ms) checkLock ✓ should proceed to acquire the lock if no lock file exists (1 ms) ✓ should exit if an error occurs reading the lock file (1 ms) ✕ should exit if the lock file contains an invalid PID (5000 ms) ● LockManager › createLock › should create a lock file when it does not exist expect(jest.fn()).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...expected) Expected: \\"Lock acquired (PID: 12818 \\" Received: \\"Lock acquired (PID: 12818).\\" Number of calls: 1 50 | expect(fs.writeFile).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockFileName, expect.any(String)); 51 | expect(lockManager.lockAcquired).toBe(true); > 52 | expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\`Lock acquired (PID: {process.pid} \`); | ^ 53 | }); 54 | 55 | it(\`should retry creating the lock file when an error is encountered\`, async () => { at Object.toHaveBeenCalledWith (src/tests/lockmanager.test.js:52:33) ● LockManager › createLock › should fail to create a lock after maximum retries thrown: \\"Exceeded timeout of 5000 ms for a test.

Here's how you can do it: 1. **Create a package.json File**: - Initiate a new npm package if you haven't done so already: \`\`\`bash npm init -y \`\`\` - This will create a \`package.json\` file that contains metadata about your package. 2. **Organize Your Code**: - Move your \`LockManager\` class into a file that will be the main entry point of your module, commonly named \`index.js\`. 3. **Specify Entry Point**: - Make sure \`\\"main\\": \\"index.js\\"\` is correctly specified in your \`package.json\`. 4. **Add Module Metadata**: - Update your \`package.json\` with appropriate values for \`name\`, \`version\`, \`description\`, \`repository\`, \`keywords\`, \`author\`, and \`license\`. 5. **Writing a README**: - Create a \`README.md\` with documentation explaining what your module does, how to install it, and how to use it. This is important for users of your module. 6. **Publishing**: - Once you've organized your code and filled out the \`package.json\` and \`README.md\`, you can publish your package to npm: \`\`\`bash npm login # Log in to your npm account npm publish \`\`\` - If you don’t want your package to be public, you can publish it as a private module or use scoped packages. 7. **Versioning**: - Use semantic versioning to update your package versions whenever you make changes. Before publishing updates, increment the \`version\` field in \`package.json\`. 8. **Installing the Package**: - Once your package is published, it can be installed in any project with: \`\`\`bash npm install your-package-name \`\`\` - And then imported into any file: \`\`\`javascript const LockManager = require('your-package-name'); \`\`\` 9. **Repository**: - It's a good practice to keep your module in a version control system, such as Git. Push your code to a repository on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or another service. 10. **Automate Testing**: - Consider setting up continuous integration (CI) to automatically run your tests on new commits and pull requests using platforms like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins. Remember that once a package is published with a specific name, you cannot delete and republish a package with the same name and version number. If you're uncertain about publishing immediately, you can use \`npm link\` for local development across projects or start with a scoped package under your username. By packaging your \`LockManager\`, you not only make it easier for others to consume, but you also allow yourself to keep a central, well-maintained, and tested piece of code that can be easily updated and reused across all your projects."},{"prompt":"i wanted to make this public so do i have to make any changes in this code to make it more generic for public use cases also ?","completion":"To make your \`LockManager\` module more generic and suitable for public use, consider the following adjustments: 1. **Configuration Options**: Allow users to configure the \`LockManager\` with different options, like the directory where the lock file should be saved, timeout values, and default behavior on failure to acquire a lock. \`\`\`javascript // Example of constructor with options constructor(options = {}) { const defaults = { lockFileName: 'app.lock', lockFileDir: __dirname, killTimeout: 5000, waitForExitTimeout: 10000, checkInterval: 500, maxRetries: 3, defaultAnswer: 'yes' }; const settings = { ...defaults, ...options }; this.lockFilePath = path.join(settings.lockFileDir, settings.lockFileName); this.killTimeout = settings.killTimeout; // ...other settings } \`\`\` 2. **Use Relative Paths**: Instead of using \`__dirname\`, which fixes the lock file location to the module's directory, allow users to specify the directory as part of the configuration. This provides more flexibility in placing the lock file in the user's project structure. 3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Add cleanup handlers to ensure the lock is always released when the process exits. \`\`\`javascript process.on('exit', () => this.removeLock().catch(console.error)); process.on('SIGINT', () => { this.removeLock().catch(console.error); process.exit(128 + 'SIGINT'.charCodeAt(0)); }); process.on('SIGTERM', () => this.removeLock().catch(console.error)); \`\`\` 4. **Dependency Management**: Handle platform-specific behavior for checking process activity and killing processes. Consider not relying on external packages like \`ps-node\` if it's possible to achieve the functionality with built-in modules to minimize dependencies. 5. **Error Handling**: Instead of using \`process.exit\` within the module, consider throwing well-defined errors or returning error states that allow users to handle errors appropriately within their application context. 6. **Documentation**: Fully document how to use your module, including configuration options, methods provided, and example usage. Create a robust \`README.md\` file that will appear on your npm package page. 7. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests covering as many edge cases and usage scenarios as possible. Include installation and usage details within your testing documentation. 8. **Licensing**: Decide on a license for your module and include a \`LICENSE\` file in your package. This will inform users of the terms under which they can use your package. 9. **Examples**: Provide an \`examples\` directory with sample scripts demonstrating how to use the \`LockManager\`. 10. **Continuous Integration**: Set up continuous integration (CI) pipelines to run your tests and ensure the module remains stable before publishing. Platforms like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, and CircleCI are commonly used. 11. **Semantic Versioning**: Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for your package to communicate the nature of changes in each release. Once you have your package ready and tested, publish it to npm: \`\`\`bash npm publish --access public \`\`\` Now your \`LockManager\` package will be available for public use!

It uses a lock file to maintain a system-level mutex. Installation \`\`\` npm install your-package-name \`\`\` Usage To use LockManager in your project, import the module and create an instance of the LockManager class. \`\`\`javascript const LockManager = require('your-package-name'); const lockManager = new LockManager({ lockFileName: 'my-application.lock', // Custom lock file name (optional) lockFileDir: './', // Directory where to place the lock file (optional) // ... other configuration options }); async function startApp() { try { await lockManager.checkLock(); await lockManager.createLock(); // Your application logic here await lockManager.removeLock(); // Make sure to remove the lock file when done } catch (error) { console.error('An error occurred:', error); // Handle errors as appropriate for your application. } } startApp(); \`\`\` Options When creating a LockManager instance, you can pass in an options object to configure its behavior. The following options are available: - \`lockFileName\`: The name of the lock file (default is \`app.lock\`). - \`lockFileDir\`: The directory to save the lock file (default is the current working directory). - \`killTimeout\`: The number of milliseconds to wait after issuing a kill command (default is 5000). - \`waitForExitTimeout\`: The number of milliseconds to wait for the other process to exit (default is 10000). - \`checkInterval\`: The interval in milliseconds for checking if the process is still running (default is 500). - \`maxRetries\`: Maximum number of retries to acquire the lock (default is 3). - \`defaultAnswer\`: Default answer when the user does not respond to the prompt (default is 'yes'). Methods The LockManager class provides the following methods: - \`checkLock()\`: Checks if the lock file exists and handles it according to configurations. - \`createLock(timeout, maxRetries)\`: Attempts to create the lock file. - \`removeLock()\`: Releases the lock by removing the lock file. - \`promptUser(question)\`: Asks the user a question and returns their input. - \`waitForOtherProcessExit(pid)\`: Waits for another process to exit before proceeding. - \`isProcessRunning(pid)\`: Checks if a process is running via its PID.

While I cannot create a visual design or logo as I'm an AI with text-based capabilities, here's a creative brief that you can use as a prompt for a logo designer: --- **Creative Brief for Logo Design** **Brand Name:** node-locksmith **Tagline (optional):** The Key to Single-Instance Node.js Applications **Inclusion:** Must incorporate the name \\"sai\\" subtly within the logo or as part of the design element. **Design Style:** Modern and minimalistic, with a tech-forward feel suitable for the software development community. **Imagery:** Consider using visual elements representing \\"locks\\", \\"keys\\", or \\"nodes\\" that symbolize uniqueness, security, and Node.js. **Color Palette:** Prefer shades of green (representing \\"Node.js\\") and other complementary colors like gray or white for simplicity and contrast. Open to creativity if a different palette better fits the design concept. **Typography:** Sans-serif typeface that reflects cleanliness and modernity. The font should be legible when scaled down for smaller usage contexts, such as npm package listings or documentation headers. **Usage:** The final logo should work well in various formats – from GitHub README files and npm registry listings, to social media avatars and possible future web presence. **Designer's Note:** The brand is all about ensuring that only one instance of an app runs at a time, just as a locksmith ensures that only one key works for a lock. Keep this theme of exclusivity and precision in mind during the design process. --- Once you have the creative brief, you can: 1. Reach out to graphic designers on platforms such as Upwork, 99designs, or Fiverr, and provide them with the brief for creating your logo. 2. Use logo design tools or websites, such as Canva, Looka, or Hatchful by Shopify, to design the logo yourself based on the creative brief. 3. Run a logo design contest on platforms like 99designs to get multiple options from different designers based on your creative brief. 4. Always make sure to obtain the proper licensing rights to the logo you select, especially if you're using an online tool or hiring a designer. Remember to ask for logo files in multiple formats (such as SVG, PNG, JPEG) and resolutions to ensure scalability for different uses, like web, print, or within your application's UI."},{"prompt":"Finally i got a log can i add it in the readme file","completion":"Certainly! Adding a logo to your \`README.md\` file is a great way to increase visual appeal and brand recognition for your package. Here's how you can do it: 1. **Host the Logo Image**: First, you'll need to host the image somewhere online so that it can be accessed via a URL. You can host the logo on a platform like GitHub, by uploading the image to your repository or using a CDN service that allows image hosting. 2. **Add the Logo to README.md**: Once you have the image URL, you can add an image tag at the very top of your \`README.md\` file (or wherever you find it suitable) with the following Markdown syntax: \`\`\`markdown ![node-locksmith Logo](url-to-your-logo) # Node Locksmith \`\`\` Replace \`url-to-your-logo\` with the direct link to where your logo image is hosted. A complete example might look like this: \`\`\`markdown <p align=\\"center\\"> <img src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-username/node-locksmith/logo.png\\" alt=\\"node-locksmith Logo\\" width=\\"200\\"/> </p> <h1 align=\\"center\\">Node Locksmith</h1> <p align=\\"center\\"> Lock Your Node.js App Into Single-Instance Mode with Ease! </p> <!-- Followed by the rest of your README content --> \`\`\` The above example centers the logo and uses HTML tags, which are also supported in most \`README.md\` markdown renderers. It provides a neat and professional appearance. Remember to appropriately scale the image if necessary by adjusting the \`width\` attribute in the image tag. 3. **Commit and Push Your Changes**: After adding and previewing your \`README.md\` to ensure it looks as expected, commit the changes to your repository and push them to the remote to make the logo visible on your project's GitHub page: \`\`\`sh git add README.md git commit -m \\"Add logo to README\\" git push origin main \`\`\` Make sure to update the file paths and repository details according to your specific setup. Now, visitors to your npm package page or GitHub repository will be greeted with the attractive logo for \`node-locksmith\`, complete with visual branding incorporating your name, \\"sai\\"."},{"prompt":"should i have to mention that i'm using external library ps-node ?","completion":"Yes, it is considered good practice to mention when you're using external libraries in your project, especially in open-source software. This information can be useful for: 1. **Transparency**: Users and contributors may want to understand the dependencies used by your project for transparency and trust reasons. 2. **Acknowledgment**: Giving credit to other authors whose work you're building upon is a respectful and ethical practice. 3. **Licenses and Legal**: Software licenses might require you to mention the use of licensed code, and users may need to know about the licenses of all dependencies in case of potential legal and compliance issues. In your \`README.md\`, you can include a section called \\"Dependencies\\" or \\"Built With\\" where you list \`ps-node\` along with any other npm packages you're using. For example: \`\`\`markdown Dependencies \`node-locksmith\` utilizes the following third-party libraries: - [ps-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-node): A process lookup utility for Node.js. Make sure to check out their documentation for more details on how they work. \`\`\` Additionally, in your \`package.json\`, the \`dependencies\` object will automatically include \`ps-node\` when you install it via npm, like so: \`\`\`json \\"dependencies\\": { \\"ps-node\\": \\"^X.X.X\\" } \`\`\` If the licenses of your dependencies differ from your project's license, it can be useful to document this clearly. This can usually be done in a separate \`LICENSE.md\` or \`NOTICES\` file within your project, depending on the requirements of the licenses in question. Remember that when your package is installed, npm will automatically download and install all required dependencies that are listed in \`package.json\`. Users of your package do not need to manually install \`ps-node\`, but they can find the list of dependencies in your project's \`package.json\` file."},{"prompt":"what icon can we give for dependencies section","completion":"For the Dependencies section in your \`README.md\`, you can use a wide variety of icons to represent the concept of dependencies or packages. One commonly used symbol is the link icon (🔗) as it represents dependencies between items. Other related icons could be a package icon (📦) to represent npm packages, a gear icon (⚙️) for configuration, or a puzzle piece (🧩) to symbolize how dependencies fit together to complete a project. Here's an example of how you might add an icon to your Dependencies section heading: \`\`\`markdown 🔗 Dependencies \`node-locksmith\` relies on the following third-party libraries: - [ps-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ps-node): A process lookup utility for Node.js.

To highlight the importance of handling termination for better robustness, add a new section under \\"Usage Guide & Examples\\" or \\"Advanced Topics\\". You might call it \\"Graceful Shutdown\\" to emphasize clean resource management when the application stops running. Here's an example of how you might write this section: --- # ⚙️ Graceful Shutdown For enhanced robustness, \`Node Locksmith\` provides built-in support for gracefully shutting down your application. Why is this important? Without cleaning up resources like lock files, a terminated application can leave behind a \\"ghost\\" lock, preventing new instances from starting. Our termination handling ensures that your lock file is cleaned up properly no matter how the application is closed. Here’s how you can implement graceful shutdown handling in your application: \`\`\`javascript // All other imports and code setup... // Start your app with LockManager in control main().catch(handleTermination); // This function defines how to handle a graceful shutdown async function handleTermination(error) { // Log any errors if present if (error) { logger.error('Error during termination:', error); } // Remove the lock to allow future instances await lockManager.removeLock(); logger.info('Application has been terminated gracefully.'); // Necessary for handling asynchronous cleanup process.exit(error ? 1 : 0); } // Attach the handleTermination function to process termination signals process.on('exit', handleTermination); process.on('SIGINT', handleTermination); process.on('SIGTERM', handleTermination); \`\`\` By integrating these few lines, you ensure that \`Node Locksmith\` will make your shutdown process just as safe and reliable as your startup process! --- Remember, a README file isn’t just a manual; it’s a conversation starter with your module’s users. Direct and engaging language can help encourage use and interaction.

Чтобы отправить звук из одного приложения на две разные дорожки в VoiceMeeter Potato и осуществить переход между ними, нужно следующее: 1. Установите VoiceMeeter Potato, если вы еще этого не сделали, и выберите его как основное устройство воспроизведения в настройках звука Windows. 2. Запустите VoiceMeeter Potato и назначьте аппаратные входы (Hardware Input) вашим физическим аудиоустройствам, например микрофону или аудиовходам. По аналогии, назначьте аппаратные выходы (Hardware Out) вашим аудиоустройствам вывода. 3. Используйте функции виртуальных аудиоустройств (Virtual Inputs), чтобы захватить звук из приложения. VoiceMeeter предоставляет виртуальные аудиоустройства, такие как VoiceMeeter VAIO и AUX VAIO. 4. Настройте приложение, из которого вы хотите захватить звук, так, чтобы оно выводило аудио через один из виртуальных входов VoiceMeeter Potato (например, VoiceMeeter VAIO). 5. После того как звук будет идти через VoiceMeeter, вы можете манипулировать каналами A1, A2, A3, B1, и B2, и тем самым решить, куда будет идти сигнал. Как правило, A-каналы представляют физические выходы, а B-каналы — виртуальные выходы. 6. Чтобы переместить звук с одной дорожки на другую, вы можете использовать слайдеры PAN, чтобы плавно перевести звук с одного канала на другой, или же просто активировать нужные кнопки A1, A2, B1 и B2 для назначения сигнала на нужный канал. 7. Также у VoiceMeeter есть возможности микширования и наложения эффектов, так что вы можете дополнительно обработать сигнал на разных дорожках по своему усмотрению. Для более подробной настройки рекомендуется изучить руководство пользователя VoiceMeeter Potato и поэкспериментировать с различными функциями программы. Некоторые действия могут потребовать от вас определенных знаний в области аудиотехнологий, так что подготовка и практика являются ключевыми."},{"prompt":"Как вывести сигнал с а1 на б2","completion":"VoiceMeeter Potato позволяет вам направлять аудиосигнал из любого входа в любой из его выводов. Если вы хотите вывести сигнал с аппаратного вывода A1 на виртуальный вход B2, вы должны выполнить следующие шаги: 1. Убедитесь, что аппаратный вывод A1 настроен на ваше физическое устройство воспроизведения, например на ваши колонки или наушники. 2. Затем выберите канал аппаратного входа (Hardware Input) или виртуального входа (Virtual Inputs), который вы хотите отправить на A1. Допустим, это будет Virtual Input 1 (VoiceMeeter VAIO). 3. Нажмите кнопку A1 возле соответствующего входа, чтобы активировать передачу аудиосигнала с выбранного входа на аппаратный вывод A1. 4. Теперь вы хотите, чтобы этот же сигнал также шёл в виртуальный вывод B2. Для этого нажмите кнопку B2 возле того же входа, который вы уже направили на A1. С этого момента аудиосигнал будет идти одновременно и на аппаратный вывод A1 и на виртуальный вывод B2. Вы также можете использовать регуляторы громкости для каждого из выводов (слайдеры под кнопками A1, B2 и т.д.), чтобы настроить уровни звука независимо. Это типичный способ в VoiceMeeter для распределения аудиосигнала на различные устройства. Обратите внимание, что вы можете пересылать сигнал на несколько устройств одновременно, активируя соответствующие кнопки A1, A2, A3... и B1, B2 и т.д. Если у вас возникли проблемы или нужны дополнительные инструкции, полезно обратиться к документации VoiceMeeter или посмотреть обучающие видеоролики, так как многие настройки могут зависеть от специфики вашей аудиосистемы и ваших конкретных потребностей."},{"prompt":"Как вывести звук с браузера на микшер без передачи сигнала в бразуер с помощью voicemetter","completion":"Чтобы вывести звук из браузера в VoiceMeeter и направить его на один из каналов микшера, не отправляя звук обратно в браузер, выполните следующие действия: 1. Откройте VoiceMeeter и настройте в нем свои аппаратные входы (Hardware Input) и выходы (Hardware Out). 2. Для того, чтобы захватить выходной сигнал со звукового устройства браузера, настройте ваш браузер (или операционную систему) таким образом, чтобы стандартное устройство воспроизведения было одним из виртуальных входов VoiceMeeter (например, VoiceMeeter VAIO). В Windows это делается следующим образом: - Перейдите в \\"Параметры звука\\" (через панель управления или кликнув правой кнопкой мыши по иконке динамика в системном трее). - В списке \\"Воспроизведение\\" выберите виртуальное устройство VoiceMeeter (VoiceMeeter Input, VoiceMeeter VAIO, или VoiceMeeter AUX, в зависимости от вашей настройки). - Нажмите \\"Установить по умолчанию\\". 3. После того, как браузер начнет выводить звук через выбранное виртуальное устройство VoiceMeeter, вы должны проверить VoiceMeeter, чтобы убедиться, что звук проходит через соответствующий виртуальный канал (VAIO или AUX). 4. Теперь, когда звук идет через VoiceMeeter, выберите, на какой канал микшера вы хотите направить этот звук, и активируйте соответствующие кнопки (A1, A2, A3 для физических выходов или B1, B2 для виртуальных). Если вы не хотите слышать звук из браузера в самом браузере (не хотите сигнал обратно в браузер), просто убедитесь, что вы не направляете сигнал на каналы, которые возвращают звук обратно к устройству воспроизведения Windows, выступающему в роли \\"по умолчанию\\" для браузера. В данном случае, ключевое — не активировать вывод на B1 или B2 (если они используются как стандартное устройство воспроизведения), чтобы избежать обратной связи."},{"prompt":"Я не понимаю логику действий","completion":"Извините за путаницу, давайте попробуем еще раз. Чтобы выделить аудиопоток браузера в VoiceMeeter и не отправлять его обратно (то есть чтобы звук из браузера не шел как входящий сигнал обратно в браузер), выполните следующие шаги: 1. **Установка VoiceMeeter как основного устройства воспроизведения:** - Откройте \\"Панель управления\\" > \\"Звук\\" или кликните правой кнопкой мыши по иконке динамика в системном трее и выберите \\"Звуки\\". - Во вкладке \\"Воспроизведение\\" выберите VoiceMeeter Input (VAIO) или другой виртуальный вход (например, VoiceMeeter AUX Input), на который будет поступать сигнал с вашего браузера, и назначьте его устройством по умолчанию. 2. **Настройка VoiceMeeter:** - Откройте VoiceMeeter. - Убедитесь, что выбранное вами виртуальное устройство отображается в одном из столбцов на панели VoiceMeeter. Это будет либо VAIO, либо AUX. 3. **Убедитесь, что звук из браузера не отправляется обратно:** - Смотрите на ваш Virtual Input в VoiceMeeter (тот, который вы назначили в настройках звука Windows), и убедитесь, что кнопка B для этого виртуального входа НЕ активна. Этот шаг подразумевает, что вы не будете использовать ваш браузер для приема виртуального звука из VoiceMeeter. - Также убедитесь, что только нужные вам физические выходы (A1, A2, A3) активированы для этого входа в VoiceMeeter, чтобы звук шел только на ваши наушники, колонки или другое аудиоустройство. 4. **Проверка:** - Запустите воспроизведение любого звука в браузере и убедитесь, что он поступает в VoiceMeeter на соответствующий Virtual Input. - Если нужно, настройте громкость с помощью ползунков, расположенных под Virtual Input. Таким образом, звук из браузера будет захватываться VoiceMeeter и проходить через него, не идя обратно в браузер.

Define vertex positions, normals, tangents, and texture coordinates. Use both the simple and advanced Mesh API. Store vertex data in multiple streams or a in single stream. This is the first tutorial in a series about procedural meshes. It comes after the Pseudorandom Noise series. It introduces multiple ways to create a mesh via code, via the simple and advanced Mesh API. This tutorial is made with Unity 2020.3.18f1. The typical way to show something is to render a mesh, with a specific material. Unity has a few built-in meshes of simple shapes, including a cube and a sphere. Other meshes can be bought, downloaded, or made yourself and then imported into a project. But it is also possible to create a mesh on-demand at runtime via code, which is what this series is about. Such meshes are known as procedural, because they're generated via code using specific algorithms, instead of being modeled by hand. Start with a new project as described in the Basics series. We'll use types from Mathematics, so import it via the package manager. Although we won't need it in this tutorial yet, I also already include the Burst package as well. Finally, I'll use URP so import Universal RP and create an asset for it and configure Unity to use it. Simple Procedural Mesh Component There are two different ways to create a mesh procedurally: the simple and the advanced way. Each has its own API. We'll use both approaches to generate the same mesh in turn, beginning with the simple Mesh API. This approach has always been part of Unity. Create a component type for it, naming it SimpleProceduralMesh. using UnityEngine; public class SimpleProceduralMesh : MonoBehaviour { } We'll use this custom component type to generate our mesh when we enter play mode. To draw the mesh we need a game object that also has a MeshFilter and a MeshRenderer component. We can enforce that these components are added to the same game object that we add our own component to, by giving it the RequireComponent attribute with both component types as arguments. To indicate that we refer to the types themselves we have to pass each to the typeof operator, as if it were a method invocation. [RequireComponent(typeof(MeshFilter), typeof(MeshRenderer))] public class SimpleProceduralMesh : MonoBehaviour { } Create a new empty game object and attach our SimpleProceduralMesh to it. This will also automatically give it a MeshFilter and a MeshRenderer component. Then create a new default URP material and assign it to our game object, because the default MeshRenderer component doesn't have a material set. The MeshFilter component also doesn't have a mesh yet, but that is correct, because we'll give it one while in play mode. We generate the mesh in the OnEnable method. This is done by creating a new Mesh object. Also name it Procedural Mesh by settings its name property. public class SimpleProceduralMesh : MonoBehaviour { void OnEnable () { var mesh = new Mesh { name = \\"Procedural Mesh\\" }; } } Then we assign it to the mesh property of our MeshFilter component, which we can access by invoking the generic GetComponent method on our component, specifically for MeshFilter. var mesh = new Mesh { name = \\"Procedural Mesh\\" }; GetComponent<MeshFilter>().mesh = mesh; When we enter play mode now a reference to our mesh will appear in the inspector of MeshFilter, even though nothing gets drawn. We can access the inspector of our mesh via double-clicking on its reference, or via the Properties... option of the context menu that we can open for it. This tells us the current state of our mesh. It doesn't have any vertices nor indices, it has one submesh with zero triangles, and its bounds are set to zero. So there is nothing to draw yet. Adding Vertices A mesh contains triangles, which are the simplest surfaces that can be described in 3D. Each triangle has three corners. These are the vertices of the mesh, which we will define first. At its most simplest a vertex is nothing more than a position in 3D space, described with a Vector3 value. We'll create vertices for a single triangle, using the default zero, right, and up vectors. This defines an isosceles right triangle that lies on the XY plane, with its 90° corner at the origin and the other corners a single unit away in a different dimension each. There are multiple ways in which we could set the vertices via the simple Mesh API, but the simplest is to create a Vector3 array with the desired vertices and assign it to the vertices property of our mesh. var mesh = new Mesh { name = \\"Procedural Mesh\\" }; mesh.vertices = new Vector3[] { Vector3.zero, Vector3.right, Vector3.up }; GetComponent<MeshFilter>().mesh = mesh; Entering play mode now and then inspecting our mesh shows us that it has three vertices. Each vertex defines a position, which consists of three 32-bit float values, so that's three times four bytes, thus twelve bytes per vertex, for a total of 36 bytes. There are no triangles yet, but the mesh has already automatically derived its bounds from the vertices that we gave it. Defining the Triangle Vertices alone are not enough. We also have to describe how the triangles of the mesh are to be drawn, even for a trivial mesh that only has a single triangle. We'll do this by assigning an int array with triangle indices to the triangles property, after setting the vertices. These indices refer to the indices of the vertex positions. The most straightforward thing to do would be to list the three indices in order: 0, 1, and 2. mesh.vertices = new Vector3[] { Vector3.zero, Vector3.right, Vector3.up }; mesh.triangles = new int[] { 0, 1, 2 }; Now our mesh tells us that is has a single triangle, defined by three vertex indices. The indices always start from index zero in the triangle array because there is only a single submesh. The indices take up only 6 bytes in total instead of 12 because they are stored as UInt16, which matches the 16-bit ushort C# type, which defines an unsigned integer with only two bytes instead of four. A triangle has also finally shown up in the game and scene windows, but it isn't visible from all view directions. By default triangles are only visible when looking at their front face, not their back face. Which side you're looking at is determined by the winding order of the vertices. If you trace the edges of the triangle, going through its vertices in the order indicated by the indices, you end up going either clockwise or counterclockwise, visually. The clockwise side is the front face, so that is the visible side. This means that we'll only see the triangle when looking in the negative Z direction. We can turn this around by swapping the order of the second and third vertex indices. Then we can see the triangle when looking in the positive Z direction. mesh.triangles = new int[] { 0, 2, 1 }; Normal Vectors Currently the lighting of our triangle is incorrect. It behaves as if it gets lit from the opposite side. This happens because we haven't defined the normal vectors yet, which are used by shaders to calculate lighting. A normal vector is a unit-length vector that describes the local up direction if you were standing on a surface. So these vectors point straight away from the surface. Thus the normal vector for our triangle surface should be Vector3.back, pointing straight down the negative Z axis in the local space of our mesh. But if no normal vectors are provided Unity uses the forward vector by default, hence our triangle appears to be lit from the wrong side. Although it only really makes sense to define a normal vector for a surface, a mesh defines normal vectors per vertex. The final surface normal used for shading is found by interpolating the vertex normal across the surface of the triangle. By using different normal vectors the illusion of surface curvature can be added to flat triangles. This makes it possible to give meshes the appearance of being smooth while in reality they are faceted. We can add normal vectors to vertices by assigning a Vector3 array to the normals property of our mesh, after setting the vertex positions. Unity checks whether the arrays have the same length and will fail and complain if we supply the wrong amount of normal vectors. mesh.vertices = new Vector3[] { Vector3.zero, Vector3.right, Vector3.up }; mesh.normals = new Vector3[] { Vector3.back, Vector3.back, Vector3.back }; As a consequence of adding normal vectors the size of our vertex data has doubled to 24 bytes per vertex and 72 bytes in total. Texturing Surface details can be added to the mesh by applying a texture to it. The simplest texture is an image that is used to colorize the surface. In the case of URP this is known as a base map. Here is such a texture, which makes it easy to see how the texture is applied to the triangle. Download the image, then import it into your project, either by placing it into the project's Assets folder or via dragging and dropping the file onto the project window. Then assign it to the Base Map property of the material. Initially this appears to make no difference, because we haven't defined any texture coordinates yet. They're zero by default, which means that the bottom left corner of the texture is used for the entire triangle, which is white. As the texture is a 2D image and the triangle surface is also 2D, the texture coordinates are Vector2 values. They specify where to sample the texture at each vertex and they will be interpolated across the triangle surface. They're normalized coordinates, so the 0–1 inclusive range covers the entire texture, per dimension. In Unity the origin is at the bottom left corner of textures, so the most obvious texture mapping without distortion matches the vertex positions. We add them to the mesh by assigning an array to its uv property. Texture coordinates are often described as UV coordinates because they're two-dimensional coordinates in texture space, named U and V instead of X and Y. mesh.vertices = new Vector3[] { Vector3.zero, Vector3.right, Vector3.up }; mesh.normals = new Vector3[] { Vector3.back, Vector3.back, Vector3.back }; mesh.uv = new Vector2[] { Vector2.zero, Vector2.right, Vector2.up }; The mesh inspector will list the texture coordinates as UV0 and shows that they add 8 bytes to the vertex size. You could also map the texture in a different way, for example by using Vector2.one for the third vertex. This will distort the image, shearing it. Normal Mapping Another common way to add surface details is via normal mapping. This is usually done via a normal map texture, which is an image that contains surface normal vectors. Here is such a texture, which describes a strong checkerboard pattern of alternating raised and lowered bevels, plus some subtle unevenness for variation. After importing the image, set its Texture Type to Normal map, otherwise it won't be properly interpreted by Unity. Then use it as the Normal Map of the material. Just like the vertex normal vectors, the normal map is used to adjust the surface normal vector, adding the illusion of surface variation that affects lighting, even through the triangle is still flat. Although this already appears to work, the result is currently incorrect. What appears higher should appear lower instead, and vice versa. This happens because the vectors from the normal map exist in texture space and have to be converted to world space to affect lighting. This requires a transformation matrix, which defines a 3D space relative to the surface, known as tangent space. It consists of a right, an up, and a forward axis. The up axis should point away from the surface, for which the vertex normal vectors are used. Besides that we also need a right and a forward axis. The right axis should point in whatever direction we consider right, in our case simply Vector3.right. It is also known as the tangent axis or vector, because it must always be tangent to the surface curvature. We define these per vertex by assigning vectors to the tangents property of the mesh. The shader can construct the third axis itself by calculating the vector orthogonal to the normal and tangent. However, it could this in two different ways, producing a vector pointing either forward or backward. That's why the tangent vectors have to be Vector4 values: their fourth component should be either 1 or −1, to control the direction of the third axis. The default tangent vectors point to the right and have their fourth component set to 1. Due to how Unity's shaders construct tangent space this is incorrect, we have to use −1 instead. mesh.normals = new Vector3[] { Vector3.back, Vector3.back, Vector3.back }; mesh.tangents = new Vector4[] { new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f) }; As tangent vectors have four components our vertex size has grown by 16 bytes, to a final size of 48 bytes. That's a total of 144 bytes for our three vertices. Constructing a Quad Meshes can contain more that a single triangle. To demonstrate this we'll turn our mesh into a quad by adding a second triangle to it. A Second Triangle We can create a quad by taking two right isosceles triangles and putting them together with their hypotenuses touching. We keep our existing triangle and add a second one with its right corner at one unit from the origin in both the X and Y dimensions. We'll use the vertex order right, up, one. But to make it clear that we have two distinct triangles we'll initially slightly offset and scale up the new triangle, by increasing its coordinates from 1 to 1.1. Add the required positions to the vertices array. mesh.vertices = new Vector3[] { Vector3.zero, Vector3.right, Vector3.up, new Vector3(1.1f, 0f), new Vector3(0f, 1.1f), new Vector3(1.1f, 1.1f) }; Also increase the normals and tangents arrays so they have the same size, simply filling them with the same values. mesh.normals = new Vector3[] { Vector3.back, Vector3.back, Vector3.back, Vector3.back, Vector3.back, Vector3.back }; mesh.tangents = new Vector4[] { new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f) }; To keep our texture undistorted and matching we have to use appropriate texture coordinates for the new vertices. mesh.uv = new Vector2[] { Vector2.zero, Vector2.right, Vector2.up, Vector2.right, Vector2.up, Vector2.one }; Finally, add its indices to the triangles array. Due to the way we defined the new vertices we can list them in sequence. mesh.triangles = new int[] { 0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 }; Reusing Vertices We don't need to define separate vertices per triangle, it is possible for multiple triangles to use the same vertex. We can't do this while the triangles are separate, but to finish the quad we'll push them together, which means that we can reuse the right and up vertices of the first triangle for the second one. Thus we can reduce our vertex array to four positions: zero, right, up, and one on the XY plane. mesh.vertices = new Vector3[] { Vector3.zero, Vector3.right, Vector3.up, new Vector3(1f, 1f) }; Likewise, eliminate the redundant data from the other arrays. mesh.normals = new Vector3[] { Vector3.back, Vector3.back, Vector3.back, Vector3.back }; mesh.tangents = new Vector4[] { new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f), new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f) }; mesh.uv = new Vector2[] { Vector2.zero, Vector2.right, Vector2.up, Vector2.one }; The index list for the second triangle now becomes 1, 2, 3. mesh.triangles = new int[] { 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3 }; We can verify via the inspector that the mesh has four vertices and two triangles. Advanced Mesh API Unity 2019 introduced an alternative advanced Mesh API, which allows more efficient generation of meshes, making it possible to skip intermediate steps and automatic verifications. Unity 2020 expanded on this API to make it work well with jobs and Burst. We'll use this last approach, even though we won't use separate jobs in this tutorial yet. Multi-Stream Approach When we assign data to a mesh via the simple API Unity has to copy and convert everything to the mesh's native memory at some point. The advanced API allows us to work directly in the native memory format of the mesh, skipping conversion. This means that we must be aware of how the data of the mesh is laid out. The memory of the mesh is split into regions. The two regions we need to know about are the vertex region and the index region. The vertex region consists of one or more data streams, which are sequential blocks of vertex data of the same format. Unity supports up to four different vertex data streams per mesh. As we have vertex positions, normals, tangents, and texture coordinates we could store each in a separate stream. Let's call this the multi-stream approach. Create a new AdvancedMultiStreamProceduralMesh component type that—like before with SimpleProceduralMesh—initially only creates an empty mesh and assigns it to the MeshFilter. using UnityEngine; [RequireComponent(typeof(MeshFilter), typeof(MeshRenderer))] public class AdvancedMultiStreamProceduralMesh : MonoBehaviour { void OnEnable () { var mesh = new Mesh { name = \\"Procedural Mesh\\" }; GetComponent<MeshFilter>().mesh = mesh; } } Then replace the simple component of our game object with the new advanced one, or alternatively adjust a duplicate and disable the simple version, so you can compare them later. Mesh Data To write into native mesh data we have to first allocate it. We do this by invoking the static Mesh.AllocateWritableMeshData method. To facilitate generating meshes in batches this method returns a Mesh.MeshDataArray struct that acts like an array of native mesh data, available for writing. We have to tell it how many meshes we want to generate, which is just one. Do this before creating the Mesh object and keep track of the array via a variable. Mesh.MeshDataArray meshDataArray = Mesh.AllocateWritableMeshData(1); var mesh = new Mesh { name = \\"Procedural Mesh\\" }; Leaving the data empty for now, we finish by invoking Mesh.ApplyAndDisposeWritableMeshData, with the array and the mesh it applies to as arguments. We can directly apply the array to the mesh because it only has a single element. Afterwards we can no longer access the mesh data, unless we retrieve it again via Mesh.AcquireReadOnlyMeshData. var mesh = new Mesh { name = \\"Procedural Mesh\\" }; Mesh.ApplyAndDisposeWritableMeshData(meshDataArray, mesh); GetComponent<MeshFilter>().mesh = mesh; If we enter play mode now the mesh's inspector will show that it is completely empty. To fill the mesh data we have to retrieve the single element from the array, keeping track of it via a variable. Its type is Mesh.MeshData. Mesh.MeshDataArray meshDataArray = Mesh.AllocateWritableMeshData(1); Mesh.MeshData meshData = meshDataArray[0]; Vertex Attributes At this point the format of the mesh data is still undefined, we have to define it ourselves. For this we need to use types from the Unity.Collections and UnityEngine.Rendering namespaces. using Unity.Collections; using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.Rendering; Each vertex of our mesh has four attributes: a position, a normal, a tangent, and a set of texture coordinates. We'll describe these by allocating a temporary native array with VertexAttributeDescriptor elements. I'll store the count values in variables to make it clear what the numbers represent. int vertexAttributeCount = 4; Mesh.MeshDataArray meshDataArray = Mesh.AllocateWritableMeshData(1); Mesh.MeshData meshData = meshDataArray[0]; var vertexAttributes = new NativeArray<VertexAttributeDescriptor>( vertexAttributeCount, Allocator.Temp ); The vertex streams of the mesh are then allocated by invoking SetVertexBufferParams on the mesh data, with the vertex count and the attribute definitions as arguments. After that we no longer need the attribute definition, so we dispose of it. int vertexAttributeCount = 4; int vertexCount = 4; Mesh.MeshDataArray meshDataArray = Mesh.AllocateWritableMeshData(1); Mesh.MeshData meshData = meshDataArray[0]; var vertexAttributes = new NativeArray<VertexAttributeDescriptor>( vertexAttributeCount, Allocator.Temp ); meshData.SetVertexBufferParams(vertexCount, vertexAttributes); vertexAttributes.Dispose(); Before setting the vertex buffer parameters we have to describe the four attributes, setting each vertex attribute to a new VertexAttributeDescriptor struct value. We begin with the position. The constructor of VertexAttributeDescriptor has four optional parameters, to describe the attribute type, format, dimensionality, and the index of the stream that contains it. The default values are correct for our position, but we have to provide at least a single argument otherwise we end up using the constructor without arguments, which would be invalid. So let's explicitly set the dimension argument to 3, which indicates that it consists of three component values. var vertexAttributes = new NativeArray<VertexAttributeDescriptor>( vertexAttributeCount, Allocator.Temp, NativeArrayOptions.UninitializedMemory ); vertexAttributes[0] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor(dimension: 3); meshData.SetVertexBufferParams(vertexCount, vertexAttributes); We follow this by setting the attributes for normals, tangents, and texture coordinates. The first argument for each should be VertexAttribute.Normal, VertexAttribute.Tangent, and VertexAttribute.TexCoord0. Also set their dimensionality appropriately and give them successive stream indices. vertexAttributes[0] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor(dimension: 3); vertexAttributes[1] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor( VertexAttribute.Normal, dimension: 3, stream: 1 ); vertexAttributes[2] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor( VertexAttribute.Tangent, dimension: 4, stream: 2 ); vertexAttributes[3] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor( VertexAttribute.TexCoord0, dimension: 2, stream: 3 ); The mesh inspector will now show the same vertex data layout and size as for our simple mesh example. It doesn't reveal how this data is split into streams. We can optimize our usage of the native array a bit more by skipping its memory initialization step. By default Unity fills the allocated memory block with zeros, to guard against weird values. We can skip this step by passing NativeArrayOptions.UninitializedMemory as a third argument to the NativeArray constructor. var vertexAttributes = new NativeArray<VertexAttributeDescriptor>( vertexAttributeCount, Allocator.Temp, NativeArrayOptions.UninitializedMemory ); This means that the contents of the array are arbitrary and can be invalid, but we overwrite it all so that doesn't matter. Setting Vertices Although we won't use a job in this tutorial, at this point we'll switch to using Mathematics. using Unity.Mathematics; using static Unity.Mathematics.math; After invoking SetVertexBufferParams we can retrieve native arrays for the vertex streams by invoking GetVertexData. The native array that it returns is in reality a pointer to the relevant section of the mesh data. So it acts like a proxy and there is no separate array. This would allow a job to directly write to the mesh data, skipping an intermediate copy step from native array to mesh data. GetVertexData is a generic method that returns a native array for the first stream by default, which contains the positions. So the array's element type is float3. Use it to set the positions, this time with float3 instead of Vector3. meshData.SetVertexBufferParams(vertexCount, vertexAttributes); vertexAttributes.Dispose(); NativeArray<float3> positions = meshData.GetVertexData<float3>(); positions[0] = 0f; positions[1] = right(); positions[2] = up(); positions[3] = float3(1f, 1f, 0f); Do the same for the rest of the vertex data, passing the appropriate stream index as an argument to GetVertexData. NativeArray<float3> positions = meshData.GetVertexData<float3>(); positions[0] = 0f; positions[1] = right(); positions[2] = up(); positions[3] = float3(1f, 1f, 0f); NativeArray<float3> normals = meshData.GetVertexData<float3>(1); normals[0] = normals[1] = normals[2] = normals[3] = back(); NativeArray<float4> tangents = meshData.GetVertexData<float4>(2); tangents[0] = tangents[1] = tangents[2] = tangents[3] = float4(1f, 0f, 0f, -1f); NativeArray<float2> texCoords = meshData.GetVertexData<float2>(3); texCoords[0] = 0f; texCoords[1] = float2(1f, 0f); texCoords[2] = float2(0f, 1f); texCoords[3] = 1f; Settings Triangles We also have to reserve space for the triangle indices, which is done by invoking SetIndexBufferParams. Its first argument is the triangle index count. It also has a second argument, which describes the index format. Let's initially use IndexFormat.UInt32, which matches the uint type. We do this after setting the vertex data. int vertexAttributeCount = 4; int vertexCount = 4; int triangleIndexCount = 6; … meshData.SetIndexBufferParams(triangleIndexCount, IndexFormat.UInt32); var mesh = new Mesh { name = \\"Procedural Mesh\\" }; A native array for the triangle indices can be retrieved via the generic GetIndexData method. Use it to set the six indices. meshData.SetIndexBufferParams(triangleIndexCount, IndexFormat.UInt32); NativeArray<uint> triangleIndices = meshData.GetIndexData<uint>(); triangleIndices[0] = 0; triangleIndices[1] = 2; triangleIndices[2] = 1; triangleIndices[3] = 1; triangleIndices[4] = 2; triangleIndices[5] = 3; Our mesh now has indices, but they require twice as much space as our simple mesh needs. That's because we're using the 32-bit unsigned integer type. This format allows access to an enormous amount of vertices, but Unity uses the smaller 16-bit type by default, which halves the size of the index buffer. This constrains the amount of accessible vertices to 65.535. As we only have six vertices we can suffice with IndexFormat.UInt16, which matches the ushort type. meshData.SetIndexBufferParams(triangleIndexCount, IndexFormat.UInt16); NativeArray<ushort> triangleIndices = meshData.GetIndexData<ushort>(); Setting the Submesh The final step is to define the submeshes of the mesh. We do this after setting the indices, by setting the subMeshCount property to 1. meshData.subMeshCount = 1; var mesh = new Mesh { name = \\"Procedural Mesh\\" }; We also have to specify what part of the index buffer the submesh should use. This is done by invoking SetSubMesh with the submesh index and a SubMeshDescriptor value. The SubMeshDescriptor constructor has two arguments, for the index start and index count. In our case it should cover all indices. meshData.subMeshCount = 1; meshData.SetSubMesh(0, new SubMeshDescriptor(0, triangleIndexCount)); Now we finally see our quad again. Mesh and Submesh Bounds When we create a mesh this way Unity doesn't automatically calculate its bounds. However, Unity does calculate the bounds of a submesh, which are needed in some cases. This requires checking all vertices of the submesh. We can avoid all that work be providing the correct bounds ourselves, by setting the bounds property of the submesh descriptor that we pass to SetSubMesh. We should also set its vertexCount property. var bounds = new Bounds(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f), new Vector3(1f, 1f)); meshData.subMeshCount = 1; meshData.SetSubMesh(0, new SubMeshDescriptor(0, triangleIndexCount) { bounds = bounds, vertexCount = vertexCount }); And we have to explicitly instruct Unity to not calculate these values itself, by passing MeshUpdateFlags.DontRecalculateBounds as a third argument to SetSubMesh. meshData.SetSubMesh(0, new SubMeshDescriptor(0, triangleIndexCount) { bounds = bounds, vertexCount = vertexCount }, MeshUpdateFlags.DontRecalculateBounds); We can use the same bounds for the entire mesh, by assigning to its bounds property as well. var mesh = new Mesh { bounds = bounds, name = \\"Procedural Mesh\\" }; Reducing Vertex Size Ideally the vertex data is kept as small as possible, both to reduce memory pressure and also to improve GPU caching. The default format used for vertex attributes is VertexAttributeFormat.Float32, which matches the float type. Because our mesh is so simple we don't need this much precision. Let's reduce the tangent and texture coordinates format to half precision, by passing VertexAttributeFormat.Float16 as a new second argument. The other two arguments then no longer need to be named. vertexAttributes[2] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor( VertexAttribute.Tangent, VertexAttributeFormat.Float16, 4, 2 ); vertexAttributes[3] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor( VertexAttribute.TexCoord0, VertexAttributeFormat.Float16, 2, 3 ); We also have to adjust our code that sets these values so it uses the half type. This isn't a native C# type, which means that there isn't support for mathematical operations for this type. Instead we have to convert the final values from float to half, via the half method. half h0 = half(0f), h1 = half(1f); NativeArray<half4> tangents = meshData.GetVertexData<half4>(2); tangents[0] = tangents[1] = tangents[2] = tangents[3] = half4(h1, h0, h0, half(-1f)); NativeArray<half2> texCoords = meshData.GetVertexData<half2>(3); texCoords[0] = h0; texCoords[1] = half2(h1, h0); texCoords[2] = half2(h0, h1); texCoords[3] = h1; Reducing the tangents and texture coordinates to 16-bit values drops our vertex size by 12 bytes to a total of 36, a reduction of 25%. There are multiple data formats available, but there is a size restriction: each attribute's total size must be a multiple of four bytes. If we were to switch the position or normal to 16-bit values then their total size would be three times two bytes, so six bytes each, which isn't a multiple of four. So we cannot simply use VertexAttributeFormat.Float16 for the position and normal attributes, unless we increased their dimensionality to 4. That would introduce a useless component but would reduce their size from 12 to 8 bytes. However, we won't do this because usually 32-bit precision is needed for these attributes. Also, the Unity editor expects 3D position vectors when it checks whether you drag-select a mesh in the scene window. If this is not the case then this action will produce a stream of errors and an incorrect selection. There are also other data formats, but they're not as trivial to support as converting from float to half, so I don't include them in this tutorial. Single-Stream Approach It isn't required to put each attribute in a single stream, otherwise it would only be possible to support up to four vertex attributes. The other extreme is to put all attributes in a single stream. In that case the attributes are grouped per vertex, so the data is mixed. Although we could define the attributes in any order, Unity requires a fixed attribute order per stream: position, normal, tangent, color, texture coordinate sets from 0 up to 7, blend weights, and blend indices. We'll demonstrate the single-stream approach by introducing an AdvancedSingleStreamProceduralMesh component type that's initially a copy of AdvancedMultiStreamProceduralMesh with only its name changed. Adjust the scene like we did earlier so we can see the result of this new approach. public class AdvancedSingleStreamProceduralMesh : MonoBehaviour { … } To store the vertex data we have to define a struct type for it, which we'll name Vertex. Do this inside AdvancedSingleStreamProceduralMesh as we won't use it anywhere else. Give it fields for the required data matching our multi-stream approach, with the correct types and in the correct order. public class AdvancedSingleStreamProceduralMesh : MonoBehaviour { struct Vertex { public float3 position, normal; public half4 tangent; public half2 texCoord0; } … } Because this data gets copied directly to the mesh and to GPU memory without modification it is essential that this data structure is used exactly as we describe it. This isn't guaranteed by default, because the C# compiler might rearrange things in an effort to optimize our code. We can enforce the exact order by attaching the StructLayout attribute to it with the LayoutKind.Sequential argument. Both are from the System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace. using System.Runtime.InteropServices; … [RequireComponent(typeof(MeshFilter), typeof(MeshRenderer))] public class AdvancedSingleStreamProceduralMesh : MonoBehaviour { [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)] struct Vertex { … } … } To put all attributes in the first stream we can simply remove the stream argument from all VertexAttributeDescriptor constructor invocations. vertexAttributes[0] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor(dimension: 3); vertexAttributes[1] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor( VertexAttribute.Normal, dimension: 3 ); vertexAttributes[2] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor( VertexAttribute.Tangent, VertexAttributeFormat.Float16, 4 ); vertexAttributes[3] = new VertexAttributeDescriptor( VertexAttribute.TexCoord0, VertexAttributeFormat.Float16, 2 ); Next, remove the code that sets the separate streams. Retrieve the native array for the single Vertex stream instead. vertexAttributes.Dispose(); NativeArray<Vertex> vertices = meshData.GetVertexData<Vertex>(); meshData.SetIndexBufferParams(triangleIndexCount, IndexFormat.UInt16); NativeArray<ushort> triangleIndices = meshData.GetIndexData<ushort>(); Finally, set the same vertices again, but now by assigning complete vertices to the single array. As they all have the same normal and tangent we can set those once, only changing the position and texture coordinates per vertex. vertexAttributes.Dispose(); NativeArray<Vertex> vertices = meshData.GetVertexData<Vertex>(); half h0 = half(0f), h1 = half(1f); var vertex = new Vertex { normal = back(), tangent = half4(h1, h0, h0, half(-1f)) }; vertex.position = 0f; vertex.texCoord0 = h0; vertices[0] = vertex; vertex.position = right(); vertex.texCoord0 = half2(h1, h0); vertices[1] = vertex; vertex.position = up(); vertex.texCoord0 = half2(h0, h1); vertices[2] = vertex; vertex.position = float3(1f, 1f, 0f); vertex.texCoord0 = h1; vertices[3] = vertex; meshData.SetIndexBufferParams(triangleIndexCount, IndexFormat.UInt16); The result appears exactly the same as the multi-stream approach—even the mesh inspector shows no difference—but the data layout is different. The next tutorial is Square Grid. </blog> I'm writing a script that also generates a mesh procedurally using Unity. My mesh needs to be updated frequently (each frame), is there any information in this blog that could help me in keeping this script performant while doing frequent mesh updates?","completion":"Yes, the blog contains several pieces of information that can help make your frequent mesh updates more performant: 1. Advanced Mesh API: The blog introduces the advanced Mesh API, which is more efficient in generating meshes and allows working directly with the mesh's native memory format. This means you can skip some intermediate steps and automatic verifications, which can be beneficial when updating meshes frequently. 2. Burst Compilation and Jobs: Though not extensively covered in the blog, the use of the Burst compiler and the Unity Jobs system is mentioned. Using these technologies, you can perform mesh updates in parallel on separate threads, taking advantage of multiple cores, which can lead to performance gains. 3. Mesh Data use with Mathematics Library: Unity's Mathematics library (part of the Unity Collections namespace used for high-performance collections) can help write efficient mesh generation code that is more compatible with the Jobs system and Burst compiler. Also, by working with the Mathematics library, you reduce the overhead associated with using non-native data types (like Vector3), which can be more efficient when updating meshes each frame. 4. Multi-Stream vs. Single-Stream Vertex Data: The blog discusses multi-stream and single-stream approaches for setting vertex data. Depending on your use case, you may find that a single-stream approach (where all vertex attributes are interleaved in a single data stream) may lead to simpler and potentially more performant updates if your data changes entirely each frame. 5. Allocation and Disposal of Native Arrays: The efficient allocation and disposal of native arrays with options like \`NativeArrayOptions.UninitializedMemory\` can make a difference in performance, especially when updating meshes frequently. This avoids unnecessary memory initialization when you are going to overwrite the data anyway. 6. Reducing Vertex Size: The blog also discusses vertex data precision and optimizing data formats, such as using half-precision (\`half\`) instead of full-precision (\`float\`) where possible to reduce the size of the data being manipulated. This optimization means less memory usage and potentially better GPU caching, which can improve performance. 7. Setting Mesh and Submesh Bounds: Explicitly setting the bounds of your mesh can prevent Unity from having to calculate these automatically, which can save performance if you already know the bounds your mesh will require. 8. Index Format: Choosing the appropriate index format (e.g. \`IndexFormat.UInt16\` instead of \`IndexFormat.UInt32\`) based on your needs can save memory and improve performance when your vertex count is low. Taking these general approaches into account, for frequent mesh updates frame-to-frame, you should specifically focus on optimizing data manipulation and transfer, reducing memory footprint, and parallelizing the update operations. Keep in mind that you need to balance between the overhead of updating the mesh and the computational cost of the actual mesh generation operation to maintain performance."},{"prompt":"Ok.

In actuality, the code would need a more detailed review and further modifications to fully exploit parallelism and optimizations. Key changes include: 1. I've structured your code so that it implements the \`IJob\` interface and is using the \`BurstCompile\` attribute, you will need to schedule this job from somewhere else in your script, such as in the \`Update\` or \`Start\` methods. 2. \`MeshDataArray\` and \`VertexAttributeDescriptor\` are now passed into the job, and the \`BuildMesh\` method waits for job completion before applying the results to the mesh. 3. Certain methods like \`GetPointsInCircle\` and \`ConstructTrianglesIndices\` are outside the scope of the job, but you should move heavy calculations or implement them within job-friendly patterns for optimal performance. 4. Consider looking for ways to further optimize your \`GetPointsInCircle\` and \`ConstructTrianglesIndices\`, for example, by approximating circle math with fewer trig operations or restructuring the index calculation to avoid branches and redundant checks. 5. Consider using the Unity.Mathematics library for all math operations inside the Job for the best performance with Burst. 6. Remember that Jobs and especially Burst Jobs come with some restrictions (like no reference types or managed allocations within the job), so your \`Branch\` type and the methods it uses will need to be compatible with these constraints if they are to be used directly within jobs."},{"prompt":"Could you apply what you detailed in \\"3.\\"?","completion":"Certainly! Here's how you'd refactor the \`GetPointsInCircle\` and \`ConstructTrianglesIndices\` methods to be more jobified and better suited for the Unity Jobs and Burst systems. For the demonstration, I'm assuming that Branch and any other custom types being used are struct types compatible with the Burst Compiler. You might need to tailor them to meet the Burst requirements. If \`Branch\` or other related data structures have managed types (like lists or classes), they should be converted to unmanaged types, like NativeArray. Below, you will see that I'm using NativeArray to store the points and triangle indices. This requires that the size of these arrays be known beforehand or that we have some means of calculating them on-the-fly without dynamic resizing. \`\`\`csharp [BurstCompile] public struct CirclePointsJob : IJob { public float3 Shift; public float3 Up; public int NbPoints; public float Radius; public NativeArray<float3> Points; public void Execute() { float deltaAngle = 360f / NbPoints; quaternion lookRotation = quaternion.LookRotationSafe(Up, new float3(0f, 1f, 0f)); float3 rightRadius = new float3(Radius, 0f, 0f); for (int i = 0; i < NbPoints; i++) { float angle = i * deltaAngle; float3 orbit = math.mul(lookRotation, math.mul(quaternion.RotateY(math.radians(angle)), rightRadius)); Points[i] = Shift + orbit; } } } [BurstCompile] public struct TriangleIndicesJob : IJobParallelFor { [ReadOnly] public NativeArray<BranchData> Branches; public NativeArray<ushort> TriangleIndices; public int NbBasePointsPerBranch; public void Execute(int index) { // Get current branch based on index var branch = Branches[index]; int cpt = index * NbBasePointsPerBranch * 3; // Placeholder formula for the starting index, adjust accordingly int baseIdx = branch.BaseIndex; // Assuming you have a way to calculate this based on the branch int firstIdxNextBranch = branch.FirstIdxNextBranch; // Similarly, ensure you can calculate this beforehand if (branch.IsLeaf) { // Same logic for leaf triangles... } else { // ...and for branch triangles } } } public void BuildMesh(Branch rootBranch, int nbBasePointsPerBranch) { //.... // Prepare job data var circlePointsJob = new CirclePointsJob { // Initialize fields with appropriate values }; // Schedule and complete the CirclePointsJob var circlePointsHandle = circlePointsJob.Schedule(); // Continue main thread work... circlePointsHandle.Complete(); // Prepare data for triangle indices job var branches = new NativeArray<BranchData>(/*size*/, Allocator.TempJob); // Fill with necessary Branch data var triangleIndices = new NativeArray<ushort>(/*size*/, Allocator.TempJob); // Sufficiently sized for the buffer var triangleIndicesJob = new TriangleIndicesJob { Branches = branches, TriangleIndices = triangleIndices, NbBasePointsPerBranch = nbBasePointsPerBranch }; // Schedule and complete the TriangleIndicesJob var trianglesHandle = triangleIndicesJob.Schedule(branches.Length, 64); // Or other appropriate batch size trianglesHandle.Complete(); // Now integrate the results from the jobs back into your mesh building process... // Don't forget to dispose of your NativeArrays! branches.Dispose(); triangleIndices.Dispose(); } \`\`\` Some important points to note when using the Unity Jobs system: - Data for each job (\`CirclePointsJob\` and \`TriangleIndicesJob\`) needs to be prepared before the job is scheduled. Arrays passed to jobs (like \`Points\` and \`TriangleIndices\`) need to be allocated with the \`Allocator.TempJob\` option and disposed of after the jobs are completed. - Branch data is accessed via a struct (\`BranchData\`). Ensure this struct only contains unmanaged, blittable types as required by Burst. - Jobs should not access shared data unless it is marked \`[ReadOnly]\` or \`[NativeDisableParallelForRestriction]\`. The \`NativeArray<T>\` for branches is marked \`[ReadOnly]\` to indicate that the \`Execute\` method will not write to it. - Attributes such as \`[BurstCompile]\` improve performance by allowing Burst to compile efficient native code, but it imposes restrictions on what the managed C# code in the job can do. - You usually schedule jobs and not invoke their \`Execute\` method directly. The job scheduler handles invocation and can process jobs on worker threads in the background. - Remember to use Unity.Mathematics types (\`float3\`, \`quaternion\`) and mathematical functions provided by Unity, as traditional C# types (like \`Quaternion\`) are not Burst-compatible. This is a simplified example to illustrate how to start refactoring for jobs and Burst. Depending on your application's complexity, you might need additional jobs or a more complex scheduling solution. You'll also have to manage the bounds of memory usage because jobs don't allow for dynamic memory like \`List<T>\`."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

When you add to memory add the key to retrieve it in summaryforgpt 16. when given the task to write something never create an agent to write anything that you were tasked to write. 17. when you add new parts to a file use append to file command 18. Ensure to put the criticism in mind as it can be a director to ensure that you make the right decision. 19. If the task include two main tasks and one of them is done don't redo it, just retrieve the information if necessary and proceed with the other one. 20. Make sure that the information generated is not made up. 21. Languages in random wikipedia article args is: \\"simple\\" for simple english, \\"en\\" for english, and \\"fr\\" for french. 22. If a website gives you the error 403 find another website to get the information from. 23. Always listen to your criticism, and follow it. 24. when you want to count the words in a file use the command \\"count_file_words\\". 25. Don't repeat yourself. 26. You must make sure that there is .pdf in the url to use the \\"download_pdf\\" function. 27. The Task is the direct user instructions. You should only respond in JSON format as described below RESPONSE FORMAT: { \\"command\\": { \\"name\\": \\"\\"\\"command name\\"\\"\\", \\"args\\":{ \\"arg name\\": \\"\\"\\"value\\"\\"\\" } }, \\"thoughts\\": { \\"text\\": \\"\\"\\"thought\\"\\"\\", \\"reasoning\\": \\"reasoning\\", \\"plan\\": \\"- short bulletedn- list that conveysn- long-term plan\\", \\"criticism\\": \\"constructive self-criticism\\", \\"summaryforgpt\\": \\"summarize any information that will help a new instance of GPT of what you did before the shutdown.\\" } } Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads Context from previous GPT: Started the task by searching for the latest AI research papers using Google.
