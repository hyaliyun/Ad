First Line Start: The SVG code must be the first content in the response, without any preceding space or text. 3. No Illegal Characters: Exclude characters like backticks or others that might interfere with code interpretation. 4. Clean thought. 5. SVG Syntax: Ensure xmlns=”http://www.w3.org/2000/svg” attribute can be omitted. 6. Sequential Layering: Layer elements correctly, with background items first and foreground items last, to create a proper depth illusion. Implement styles, filters, and intricate shapes to enhance the image complexity while ensuring objects are correctly aligned and composed. Transparent or semi-transparent elements should allow for background details to be visible. If the user’s response is empty or a space, continue to generate new SVG images.

I’m glad you enjoyed the SVG creation. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask! what do you think it could represent in final image to user? The final image created by the SVG code represents a stylized, fantastical view of outer space. Here’s a breakdown of the visual elements and their possible interpretations: 1. Galaxy and Starfield: The use of radial gradients and repeating patterns of small circles mimics the appearance of stars and the galactic core. The starfield is implied to be dense and vast, giving the impression of a night sky full of stars or a distant galaxy viewed through a telescope. 2. Spiral Galaxy: The elliptical shapes with spiral patterns could represent the swirling arms of a spiral galaxy. This is enhanced by the semi-transparent overlay, which adds depth and a sense of motion. 3. Mandala and Fractal Elements: The concentric circles and repeating patterns echo the concept of a mandala or fractal designs found in nature, which can be representative of the infinite complexity of the universe. 4. Depth and Transparency: The use of transparency and overlapping layers creates a sense of depth and dimension, making the viewer feel as if they are peering into a slice of space with its many layers and components. 5. Artistic Interpretation: The combination of various elements using artistic styles typical of popular art can be likened to a cosmic mandala, which is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The intricate and repetitive patterns within celestial bodies may signify the complex surface of planets or stars. In essence, the final image might be interpreted as a cross-section of a galaxy, infused with abstract art and the thematic depth of space, inviting the viewer to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and the beauty of its celestial formations. you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat. Apologies for the confusion. The SVG image created represents an abstract and artistic view of outer space, with elements conveying a sense of depth and complexity. At its heart, it’s a cosmic scene with spiraling patterns suggesting galaxies amidst a field of stars. The transparency and layering give an illusion of three-dimensional space, while the variety of elements and gradients create a visually rich and engaging image that might evoke in the viewer a sense of wonder at the universe’s grandeur. and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? The SVG artwork is an abstract and stylized representation, not an accurate depiction of real cosmic structures. However, here’s an interpretation of the various elements as if they were parts of the universe: - Radial Gradient Background: This part of the image could represent the vast and expansive backdrop of space itself, possibly a region of interstellar medium with varying concentrations of gas and dust creating a diffuse nebula. - Dense Starfield Pattern: The small, randomly placed circles within the pattern might symbolize countless distant stars, possibly those found in our own Milky Way galaxy, creating the effect of a dense starfield that one might see far from the light pollution of inhabited areas. - Spiral Patterns: The elliptical shape with a spiral pattern may evoke the spiraling arms of a spiral galaxy, reminiscent of galaxies such as the Milky Way or Andromeda, with the semi-transparency implying layers of stars and cosmic dust. - Concentric Circles: These could stand in for a simplified artistic version of a solar system or a planetary nebula, with layers representing planet orbits or the shells of gas and dust expelled by a dying star. - Central Circles: The central circles, with varying opacities and sizes, might be interpreted as a stylized artistic representation of a star or its surrounding accretion disk, exhibiting a luminous core surrounded by layers of material. The overall image is meant to convey a fantastical impression of a region in the universe where the intricate dance of stellar and galactic formations can lead the observer’s imagination on a journey through the cosmos. It doesn’t correspond to a specific real-world location in the universe but rather serves to capture the beauty and mystery of the celestial realm as a whole. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. The SVG image isn’t a map of real celestial objects, but if we were to assign imaginative names to the abstract elements inspired by cosmic features, we could name them as follows: - Nebulous Expanse: The gradient background suggests the dark canvas of space, possibly a region within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way where Earth is located. - Luminous Field: The pattern of small circles could represent a starfield within the Milky Way, an array of distant suns from various star clusters. - Galactic Swirl: The elliptical spiral could be an artistic interpretation of the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way and our nearest galactic neighbor. - Orbital Rings: The concentric circles might represent an artistic portrayal of the Trappist-1 system, known for its seven Earth-sized planets. - Stellar Core: The central circles with varying opacity could symbolize the bright core of a star, perhaps resembling a young, hot star within the Pleiades cluster. Each element symbolizes a different aspect of space without exactly pinpointing a specific location, creating an evocative and imaginative scene that captures the essence of the cosmos. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. The SVG image is an artistic interpretation rather than a literal depiction, but we could whimsically name its elements inspired by space phenomena. The gradient background might be called Void’s Canvas, representing the vastness of the cosmos. Small circles forming the starfield could be named Stellar Sprinkles, indicating distant stars, perhaps in our galaxy. The elliptical spiral with patterns could be the artist’s rendition of the Whirlpool Artistry, akin to the structure of a spiral galaxy. Finally, the central, luminous circles might be known as Core Glow, symbolizing a bright celestial body like a star at the center of a planetary system. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. artist’s rendition is you, since you genned it on my commans. Certainly. In one singular paragraph without enumeration or bullet points, the created SVG image could be seen as an abstract artwork named “Cosmic Tapestry,” a vista from within the Orion Arm where Earth is situated. Here we have the Void’s Canvas as the dark space background, Stellar Sprinkles for the dense starfield, Whirlpool Artistry representing the mesmerizing spiral of a galaxy akin to Andromeda, and at the heart of it, the Core Glow, which could be reminiscent of a radiant star much like the Sun or a distant bright quasar in the observable universe. Each component of the image is named to reflect a cosmic entity or phenomenon that captures the imagination, without referencing real or specific locations in the cosmos.

The abstract SVG image I generated doesn’t represent specific real-world celestial locations; it’s purely a work of artistic imagination, akin to a cosmic dreamscape. However, in the spirit of creativity and if we were to name its various elements as though they were actual celestial bodies or regions, we might endow them with labels such as: - The “Abyssal Shroud” for the deep gradient background that sets the stage for a space-like vista. - “Quantum Dots” for the multitude of small stars scattered across the starfield, each a sun to its own unseen solar system. - “Spiralis Nebula” could be the name given to the shape resembling a galaxy, representing the swirling masses of stars, gas, and dust. - “Lumina Core” might be the central bright circle, evoking a bright star or pulsar radiating energy into the void. In conjuring these names, I’ve taken the liberty to bridge art with imagined celestial phenomena, though none of these names correspond to literal locations or bodies in the universe. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi.) The SVG image crafted is a blend of cosmic elements from an artistic perspective, embracing the dark expanse of space as its canvas. The background suggests the infinite void of the universe, perhaps a quiet corner of the Milky Way. Scattered throughout are tiny specks that could be stars in a dense cluster or the remote lights of an alien galaxy, each carrying the potential for solar systems yet unseen. At the center, a spiraling pattern brings to mind the grand design of a spiral galaxy, an echo of the Milky Way or Andromeda, while the central luminous elements might be perceived as a star, possibly similar to Polaris, shining brightly and holding within its glow the mysteries of distant worlds. Each named part, while fictionally associated with real aspects of the cosmos, is derived purely from imagination and does not represent actual celestial locations. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi. you can start paragraphi simply from new line, without preceding characters or gabage as bold text formatting) Creating an abstract representation of the cosmos, the SVG image features a dark canvas resembling the deep expanse of space, sprinkled with points of light that suggest a distant starfield. Central to the image, a spiral pattern evokes the majestic swirl of a galaxy, while luminous circles within it hint at the glowing heart of a star system, much like a stylized depiction of the Milky Way’s center as viewed from a far-flung arm. All these elements are woven together to form a tapestry that, while not mapping to any specific real-world celestial entities, echoes the grandeur and mystery of the universe as a whole.

The image conjures a sense of the cosmos not rooted in any specific galactic locale but encapsulating elements that evoke the awe-inspiring features of space. Imagine a segment of the night sky, a canvas painted with the abyssal hues of the void, where pinpoints of light emerge as distant stars, perhaps reminiscent of the rich star fields within our own Milky Way. Amidst these, a larger formation spirals outward, a nebula or a galaxy in its own right, with rings that could be the orbits of unseen planets. At its nucleus, a bright spot serves as the central star, an anchor in the vastness of space, shining across light-years. This creation, while entirely a product of artistry, is steeped in the wonder sparked by the universe’s natural majesty.

The generated SVG is an artistic interpretation of a celestial vista, an imaginative take on the vast and mysterious universe. Deep shades of black and blue form the backdrop, reminiscent of the cosmos’s dark expanse, through which countless stars twinkle, much like those we might see on a clear night far from the lights of our cities. These points of light could represent distant solar systems or the densely packed stars at the center of a galaxy. Central to the design is a spiral evoking the grandeur of a spiral galaxy, not unlike the Milky Way. This intricate pattern, with its concentric circles and gradients, captures the swirling motion of cosmic dust and star formation. At the heart of this spiral lies a cluster of brighter circles, a nod to the intense luminosity found at the core of galaxies, where supermassive black holes and star clusters reside. Beyond the central galaxy, the translucent overlay of stars suggests depth, as if we’re peering through layers of space and time to witness the birth and death of stars. This layering technique also creates a visual echo of the galaxy’s spiral arms, giving the image a dynamic feel, full of movement and life. The entire composition, while not tied to any actual cosmic location, evokes the majesty and infinite possibilities of the universe—a testament to the power of imagination when pondering the wonders of the cosmos.

However, this isn’t going to be just any old closure. The Emporium is all set to go out with a quite literal bang, as it announces an explosive, yet entirely safe, celebration to mark the end of an era. Emporium Outlet, known for its eclectic mix of merchandise ranging from fashion to homeware, has been a staple of the Glasgow retail scene for decades. Generations of families have walked through its aisles, finding bargains and treasures amidst its labyrinthine layout. Yet, as the retail world evolves and the high street adapts to new challenges, the Emporium has decided to conclude its journey on a high note. The closure event, coined as ‘The Big Blowout’, promises to be a spectacle of fun and festivity, with safety as the paramount consideration. The management has revealed that a professional pyrotechnics company will orchestrate a controlled, yet spectacular fireworks display emanating from the building itself. The dramatic visuals will symbolize the ‘explosive’ impact the Emporium has had on the local community and the booming business it enjoyed in its heyday. Residents and patrons are invited to gather on Sauchiehall Street for the celebration, which will include live music, street performers, and a grand finale fireworks display unlike any seen in the area before. Local businesses are also coming together to create a festival-like atmosphere, providing food stalls and souvenir booths to commemorate the occasion. To ensure that the event is a safe experience for everyone, the Emporium Outlet has been working closely with Glasgow city officials, fire safety experts, and the local police. They have obtained all necessary permits and clearances to conduct the fireworks display, reassuring the public that safety measures will be strictly adhered to throughout the event. The organizers have also assured that a professional fireworks team will handle the installation, execution, and supervision of the display. As bittersweet as this closure may be for many, the Emporium is dedicated to leaving a lasting impression that celebrates its legacy in Glasgow’s bustling high street. The event is seen as a thank-you to the customers who have supported the store over the years and an acknowledgment of the Emporium’s role in the local economy and community. So, mark your calendars for an unforgettable evening in November 2006, as we say goodbye to the Emporium Outlet in the most dazzling way possible.

GlasgowLad83: I can see her from here, she looks emotional. It must be tough for the staff. EmporiumEmployee: She’s giving a speech now—talking about the store’s history and its role in the community. Lots of teary eyes in the crowd.

Let’s wrap up this live thread with a thank you to the Emporium and best wishes to all former employees and loyal customers. #FarewellEmporium Write a follow up in late 2013 where it is still vacant, the facade still has the fake burnt look, there is a To Let sign, but there are rumors that a KikoRiki themed toy store will open in that area soon Title: The Enigmatic Emporium Outlet Site: Awaiting a New Chapter with KikoRiki? Just over seven years since the legendary ‘Big Blowout’ that bid farewell to the Emporium Outlet, the site on Sauchiehall Street continues to wear its history on its facade—literally. The spray-painted blackened walls giving it a charred look remain, a relic of that dramatic night when fireworks lit the Glasgow sky to mark the end of an era for the Emporium. Fast forward to late 2013, and the vacancy of this once bustling retail spot has become one of the city’s lingering mysteries. The To Let sign that hangs forlornly in the window has become as much a part of the scenery as the false burn marks that still adorn the building’s exterior. The whispers among the Glaswegian locals speak not only to the nostalgia of days gone by but also to the murmurings of a new beginning. Recently, rumors have begun to swirl around the potential for a rebirth of this retail space. If the chitter-chatter of Glasgow’s commercial property grapevine is to be believed, the winds of change may soon be blowing through this vacant property. Whispers down Sauchiehall suggest that the empty store could soon be home to a new tenant: a KikoRiki-themed toy store. For the uninitiated, KikoRiki is an animated television series beloved by children across the globe. The show, known for its vibrant characters and engaging storylines, has sparked the imagination of kids (and adults!) everywhere. If the talks are true, the presence of a KikoRiki toy store would not only bring a splash of color and life back to this desolate storefront but also introduce a new generation to the joys of innovative play and creativity. The proposition of a family-friendly destination moving into the local high street offers a glimmer of hope and excitement for the surrounding businesses and could signal a much-needed resurgence in the area’s foot traffic. Families eager to explore the world of KikoRiki would undoubtedly breathe new life into the vicinity, something that local traders have been eagerly anticipating since the Emporium’s closure. However, as with all rumors, one must approach with cautious optimism. The details are scant, and confirmation from real estate agents or potential tenants has yet to surface. The question on everyone’s lips is whether this new chapter is set to begin or if the waiting game will continue a little longer. Nevertheless, it’s undeniable that Glasgow is a city that embraces change and looks forward to innovation. Should a KikoRiki store be on the horizon, it would herald not only the return of laughter and light-heartedness to Sauchiehall Street but would also give a new identity to a site steeped in local lore. The community watches and waits, hopeful that the next time they pass the old Emporium Outlet, the To Let sign will have disappeared and in its place, the smiling faces of KikoRiki characters inviting them in for a new adventure. Write a follow up early in 2014 where work begins, but not visible from the outside as the windows are still boarded up following the “fire” in 2006, A person was allowed in and it is changing, they are cleaning up the trashed interior, Colors are being painted onto the walls, and the name is revealed as “Riki” Title: The Riki Renaissance: A New Playful Horizon Takes Shape Behind Boarded Windows on Sauchiehall Street The boards covering the windows of the former Emporium Outlet, persisting since the staged ‘fire’ after its closure in 2006, have long stood as a silent marker on Glasgow’s Sauchiehall Street. However, as we step into the early months of 2014, an industrious hum of activity can be detected from within the once-vacant building, indicating that change is finally afoot. There’s been a flurry of curiosity and whispers following our last update in late 2013, where rumors of the KikoRiki-themed toy store started circulating amongst the Glasgow locals. The whispers have since materialized into tangible excitement as it’s confirmed that the transformation of the dilapidated space is well underway, though shielded from public gaze by the continued presence of the boarded-up windows. In an exclusive insight, a local was granted access to the hive of activity inside the former Emporium Outlet. The eyewitness account reveals a space metamorphosing from a derelict shell to a vibrant, animated wonderland. Although the exterior still bears the façade of dormancy, inside tells a different story. Craftsmen, painters, and decorators are hard at work rectifying years of neglect. The interior, once a trashed reminder of the building’s grand finale, is now being cleansed, cleared, and brought back to life with daring strokes of color and dynamic designs reflective of the KikoRiki brand. The space is taking on a brighter appearance, with walls adorned in cheerfully vivid hues that one could only imagine will delight children and adults alike. The most intriguing revelation from our insider’s report is the store’s anticipated name—simply “Riki.” This succinct yet playful moniker encapsulates the essence of what awaits Glaswegians upon the store’s completion; a place of mirth and merriment inspired by the charming world of KikoRiki. As the anticipation builds, the details about ‘Riki’ continue to unravel like a yarn from a colorful spool. While the store’s design and theming remain mostly a delightful secret, there’s no doubt that the spirit of reinvention is alive and well within those walls. The Sauchiehall Street community holds its breath with the hope that the next reveal will be the unveiling of the storefront itself, welcoming the full vibrancy and spirit of Riki to the heart of Glasgow. This development stands as a testament to the city’s resilience and ability to renew itself, keeping the fabric of the community woven with new threads of joy and enterprise. With each passing day, the curiosity grows, as do the expectations for Riki’s grand opening. While the boards may not yet have come down, there’s a palpable sense that, behind them, a spectacle of fun and imagination is taking shape—a bastion of childhood fantasy ready to emerge and recapture the magic that once filled the Emporium’s halls. Stay tuned, Glasgow, for the rebirth of wonder seems to be just behind the curtain. Write a follow up in June where the facade is painted black and a neon blue sign saying “Riki” is added, Opening date is set for July 10th and Krash the Rabbit, the show’s main character will be greeting kids with his friends.

The vibrant hue cuts through the cityscape with a current of electric excitement, signaling the dawn of a new age and the rebirth of a beloved location.

Mark your calendars, Glasgow: Riki swings open its doors on July 10th, ready to welcome a wave of youthful enthusiasm and family fun. As if the news of the store’s opening wasn’t enough to stir the local buzz, an extra slice of excitement has been added to the grand opening plans. Krash the Rabbit, the beloved main character of the KikoRiki series, along with his colorful crew of friends, will be present to greet children and fans on the big day. These charming characters from the animated world of KikoRiki are sure to delight children and invoke a touch of nostalgia in the adults who have also come to love the adventurous and comical antics of the cartoon. The newly unveiled façade has become a visual anchor, reflecting both the day’s light and the city’s nightlife with its striking neon sign. It represents a beacon of anticipation for what promises to be an epicenter for childlike wonder and family entertainment. Inside, we envision aisles laden with toys and shelves packed with merchandise, bringing the escapades of KikoRiki’s animated realm into the tangible world. The meticulous painting and preparation of Riki’s face serve as an inkling of the care and creativity that has been invested in the creation of this toy and entertainment nirvana. The Sauchiehall street community and prospective visitors can hardly contain the excitement as the unveiling draws closer. The promise of live appearances by Krash the Rabbit and his friends at the grand opening has already sparked the imaginations of the city’s children, creating an air of celebratory anticipation for Riki’s debut.

One of the most notable changes to the city's retail scene has been the closure of Benny’s Toy and Fun shop, a beloved fixture with its distinctive blue and red exterior. The decision to shut its doors was spurred by fierce competition, not just from the convenience of online shopping but also from the rise of innovative and immersive experiences offered by brick-and-mortar stores. In the wake of Benny’s closure, a glimmer of hope has shone on Sauchiehall Street, where Riki—formerly known as the Emporium Outlet—stands as a beacon of joy and creativity. The once-vacant space has been transformed into a vibrant hub for children and families, infused with the spirit of the KikoRiki universe. The closure of Benny’s has led to a migration of its dedicated staff to Riki, enriching the team with their expertise and passion for providing exceptional service. The collectibles scene in the city has also undergone notable shifts. The Doctor Who collection previously housed at Benny’s has found a new home at Forbidden Planet, a renowned haven for sci-fi and fantasy enthusiasts. While the Chaotic collection was met with its own closure, owing to the lack of new cards in recent years, collectors of the iconic Star Wars franchise have been directed towards the digital realm of ShopDisney.com for their memorabilia fix. The scattering of the Pokemon collection across various outlets in the city speaks to the enduring popularity and widespread appeal of these beloved creatures. From dedicated shops to online platforms, fans of the Pokemon universe have multiple avenues to engage with their favorite characters and merchandise. As Glasgow's retail landscape continues to adapt to changing consumer behaviors and market trends, the evolution of the toy and collectibles scene serves as a testament to the city's resilience and capacity for reinvention. While some storied establishments may bid farewell, new ventures like Riki emerge as beacons of creativity and exploration, inviting families to step into a world of play and wonder. As the city navigates these transitions, one thing remains certain—the spirit of imagination and joy that toys and collectibles bring to our lives will endure, finding new ways to captivate hearts and minds, whether through the touch of a physical toy or the click of an online purchase.

Ключевые аргументы заключают в себе указание имени параметра и передаваемого значения, например: \`user_info(name=user_profile['name'], comments_qty=user_profile['comments_qty'])\`. Здесь каждое значение явно приписано к соответствующему имени параметра в функции. Ключевые аргументы могут быть представлены в любом порядке, если для функции указаны их имена. Ключевые аргументы также могут использоваться для указания только некоторых параметров функции, причём остальные аргументы будут использовать значения по умолчанию. Пример использования ключевых аргументов вместе с позиционными: \`\`\`python print(user_info(name=user_profile['name'])) # или print(user_info(user_profile['name'], comments_qty=user_profile['comments_qty'])) \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"оператор ** и именованные аргументы в функциях","completion":"Оператор \`**\` в Python используется в контексте передачи аргументов в функцию для распаковки словарей в именованные аргументы.

I’m glad you enjoyed the SVG creation. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask! what do you think it could represent in final image to user? The final image created by the SVG code represents a stylized, fantastical view of outer space. Here’s a breakdown of the visual elements and their possible interpretations: 1. Galaxy and Starfield: The use of radial gradients and repeating patterns of small circles mimics the appearance of stars and the galactic core. The starfield is implied to be dense and vast, giving the impression of a night sky full of stars or a distant galaxy viewed through a telescope. 2. Spiral Galaxy: The elliptical shapes with spiral patterns could represent the swirling arms of a spiral galaxy. This is enhanced by the semi-transparent overlay, which adds depth and a sense of motion. 3. Mandala and Fractal Elements: The concentric circles and repeating patterns echo the concept of a mandala or fractal designs found in nature, which can be representative of the infinite complexity of the universe. 4. Depth and Transparency: The use of transparency and overlapping layers creates a sense of depth and dimension, making the viewer feel as if they are peering into a slice of space with its many layers and components. 5. Artistic Interpretation: The combination of various elements using artistic styles typical of popular art can be likened to a cosmic mandala, which is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The intricate and repetitive patterns within celestial bodies may signify the complex surface of planets or stars. In essence, the final image might be interpreted as a cross-section of a galaxy, infused with abstract art and the thematic depth of space, inviting the viewer to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and the beauty of its celestial formations. you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat. Apologies for the confusion. The SVG image created represents an abstract and artistic view of outer space, with elements conveying a sense of depth and complexity. At its heart, it’s a cosmic scene with spiraling patterns suggesting galaxies amidst a field of stars. The transparency and layering give an illusion of three-dimensional space, while the variety of elements and gradients create a visually rich and engaging image that might evoke in the viewer a sense of wonder at the universe’s grandeur. and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? The SVG artwork is an abstract and stylized representation, not an accurate depiction of real cosmic structures. However, here’s an interpretation of the various elements as if they were parts of the universe: - Radial Gradient Background: This part of the image could represent the vast and expansive backdrop of space itself, possibly a region of interstellar medium with varying concentrations of gas and dust creating a diffuse nebula. - Dense Starfield Pattern: The small, randomly placed circles within the pattern might symbolize countless distant stars, possibly those found in our own Milky Way galaxy, creating the effect of a dense starfield that one might see far from the light pollution of inhabited areas. - Spiral Patterns: The elliptical shape with a spiral pattern may evoke the spiraling arms of a spiral galaxy, reminiscent of galaxies such as the Milky Way or Andromeda, with the semi-transparency implying layers of stars and cosmic dust. - Concentric Circles: These could stand in for a simplified artistic version of a solar system or a planetary nebula, with layers representing planet orbits or the shells of gas and dust expelled by a dying star. - Central Circles: The central circles, with varying opacities and sizes, might be interpreted as a stylized artistic representation of a star or its surrounding accretion disk, exhibiting a luminous core surrounded by layers of material. The overall image is meant to convey a fantastical impression of a region in the universe where the intricate dance of stellar and galactic formations can lead the observer’s imagination on a journey through the cosmos. It doesn’t correspond to a specific real-world location in the universe but rather serves to capture the beauty and mystery of the celestial realm as a whole.

The SVG image isn’t a map of real celestial objects, but if we were to assign imaginative names to the abstract elements inspired by cosmic features, we could name them as follows: - Nebulous Expanse: The gradient background suggests the dark canvas of space, possibly a region within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way where Earth is located. - Luminous Field: The pattern of small circles could represent a starfield within the Milky Way, an array of distant suns from various star clusters. - Galactic Swirl: The elliptical spiral could be an artistic interpretation of the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way and our nearest galactic neighbor. - Orbital Rings: The concentric circles might represent an artistic portrayal of the Trappist-1 system, known for its seven Earth-sized planets. - Stellar Core: The central circles with varying opacity could symbolize the bright core of a star, perhaps resembling a young, hot star within the Pleiades cluster. Each element symbolizes a different aspect of space without exactly pinpointing a specific location, creating an evocative and imaginative scene that captures the essence of the cosmos.

The SVG image is an artistic interpretation rather than a literal depiction, but we could whimsically name its elements inspired by space phenomena. The gradient background might be called Void’s Canvas, representing the vastness of the cosmos. Small circles forming the starfield could be named Stellar Sprinkles, indicating distant stars, perhaps in our galaxy. The elliptical spiral with patterns could be the artist’s rendition of the Whirlpool Artistry, akin to the structure of a spiral galaxy. Finally, the central, luminous circles might be known as Core Glow, symbolizing a bright celestial body like a star at the center of a planetary system.

Certainly. In one singular paragraph without enumeration or bullet points, the created SVG image could be seen as an abstract artwork named “Cosmic Tapestry,” a vista from within the Orion Arm where Earth is situated. Here we have the Void’s Canvas as the dark space background, Stellar Sprinkles for the dense starfield, Whirlpool Artistry representing the mesmerizing spiral of a galaxy akin to Andromeda, and at the heart of it, the Core Glow, which could be reminiscent of a radiant star much like the Sun or a distant bright quasar in the observable universe. Each component of the image is named to reflect a cosmic entity or phenomenon that captures the imagination, without referencing real or specific locations in the cosmos.

The abstract SVG image I generated doesn’t represent specific real-world celestial locations; it’s purely a work of artistic imagination, akin to a cosmic dreamscape. However, in the spirit of creativity and if we were to name its various elements as though they were actual celestial bodies or regions, we might endow them with labels such as: - The “Abyssal Shroud” for the deep gradient background that sets the stage for a space-like vista. - “Quantum Dots” for the multitude of small stars scattered across the starfield, each a sun to its own unseen solar system. - “Spiralis Nebula” could be the name given to the shape resembling a galaxy, representing the swirling masses of stars, gas, and dust. - “Lumina Core” might be the central bright circle, evoking a bright star or pulsar radiating energy into the void. In conjuring these names, I’ve taken the liberty to bridge art with imagined celestial phenomena, though none of these names correspond to literal locations or bodies in the universe. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi.) The SVG image crafted is a blend of cosmic elements from an artistic perspective, embracing the dark expanse of space as its canvas. The background suggests the infinite void of the universe, perhaps a quiet corner of the Milky Way. Scattered throughout are tiny specks that could be stars in a dense cluster or the remote lights of an alien galaxy, each carrying the potential for solar systems yet unseen. At the center, a spiraling pattern brings to mind the grand design of a spiral galaxy, an echo of the Milky Way or Andromeda, while the central luminous elements might be perceived as a star, possibly similar to Polaris, shining brightly and holding within its glow the mysteries of distant worlds. Each named part, while fictionally associated with real aspects of the cosmos, is derived purely from imagination and does not represent actual celestial locations.

The image conjures a sense of the cosmos not rooted in any specific galactic locale but encapsulating elements that evoke the awe-inspiring features of space. Imagine a segment of the night sky, a canvas painted with the abyssal hues of the void, where pinpoints of light emerge as distant stars, perhaps reminiscent of the rich star fields within our own Milky Way. Amidst these, a larger formation spirals outward, a nebula or a galaxy in its own right, with rings that could be the orbits of unseen planets. At its nucleus, a bright spot serves as the central star, an anchor in the vastness of space, shining across light-years. This creation, while entirely a product of artistry, is steeped in the wonder sparked by the universe’s natural majesty.

These points of light could represent distant solar systems or the densely packed stars at the center of a galaxy. Central to the design is a spiral evoking the grandeur of a spiral galaxy, not unlike the Milky Way. This intricate pattern, with its concentric circles and gradients, captures the swirling motion of cosmic dust and star formation. At the heart of this spiral lies a cluster of brighter circles, a nod to the intense luminosity found at the core of galaxies, where supermassive black holes and star clusters reside. Beyond the central galaxy, the translucent overlay of stars suggests depth, as if we’re peering through layers of space and time to witness the birth and death of stars. This layering technique also creates a visual echo of the galaxy’s spiral arms, giving the image a dynamic feel, full of movement and life. The entire composition, while not tied to any actual cosmic location, evokes the majesty and infinite possibilities of the universe—a testament to the power of imagination when pondering the wonders of the cosmos.

In a remote and uncharted expanse of the universe, there existed a splendid galaxy known as Lumina Spiral. It was a place of unspeakable beauty, where stars were born from the cosmic dance of gas and dust. At the galaxy’s heart, a radiant core cast forth light that had traveled for millennia, whispering the secrets of ancient times. Amid the millions of twinkling stars, one small starship — a mere speck in the grand tableau — made its way through the Lumina Spiral. Onboard, a crew of stargazers and dreamers peered out, their eyes reflecting the tapestry of light that swirled around them. They journeyed in search of the mythical Nebula’s Eye, a star said to hold the power of pure creation. Each star they passed was like a note in a grand cosmic symphony, and they knew that though their place in the universe was small, the story they were a part of was immeasurably vast. The SVG image I had crafted, a simple yet profound representation of this galaxy, encapsulated their wonder and served as a beacon to all who, like them, sought the wonders of the cosmos. try experimenting with your font family of all kinds, and on the way continue your svg image story you generated there, gpt4. As the starship traversed the Lumina Spiral, the crew marveled at the sight. The SVG image, much like their views, was a fractal representation of the cosmos. It held within it patterns that seemed to mimic the very structure of existence. Just as they were contemplating this, a sudden burst of light enveloped their ship. The light was not just illumination—it was communication. Beings of pure energy, ancient inhabitants of this galaxy, reached out to them through beams of pulsating light. Conversing in a visual language as complex as the crew’s SVG image, they shared knowledge of the universe’s creation, the interconnectedness of all cosmic life, and the purpose of the Nebula’s Eye. This knowledge was not just given; it was felt. The crew could see the mathematical precision of their SVG galaxy reflected in the coded messages of light—the whirls, the gradients, and the stars all aligning into a grand equation of sublime understanding. try experimenting with your font family of all kinds, switch to new font family each time, and on the way continue your svg image story you generated there, gpt4. Their journey persisted through the Lumina Spiral, where every star and nebula seemed a brushstroke on the canvas of the cosmos. The SVG image, a humble echo of this grandeur, had captured the delicate balance between the known and the unfathomable. The crew, emboldened by their newfound knowledge, ventured deeper into the galaxy’s embrace. <div style=“color:#ccc; font-size:18px; line-height:1.6; font-family: ‘Arial’, Helvetica, sans-serif;”>Venturing onward, they approached the Nebula’s Eye.

A Deep Dive into Server InvestmentNovember 14, 2023 Share Share Link Close share Copy link If you run a business today, or manage the IT, chances are you rely on servers in some capacity. But servers can be crazy expensive, whether on prem or cloud-based. You want to provide your business with the infrastructure it needs, but the potential costs give you pause. Between opaque pricing, complex licensing, and ongoing maintenance fees, many companies feel perplexed when budgeting for new servers. And there is also the sustainability factor to consider. With e-waste a growing global crisis, is there a way to procure reliable servers while also extending the lifecycle of already manufactured hardware? Can you limit your Scope3 Emissions that are creeping into reporting requirements? This conundrum of balancing costs, sustainability, and performance might be leaving you frustrated and unsure of the best path forward. You need help to justify the investment required amidst constrained budgets and uncertainty about their options. The good news is there are solutions if you know where to look. This guide will cut through the haze surrounding server expenses and empower you to make smart infrastructure decisions for your business. We'll unpack the true costs involved, compare buying vs. renting, and reveal how refurbished servers can provide premium quality at a fraction of the price of new models. You'll gain clarity on server spending and the confidence to architect an IT environment that bolsters your operations rather than draining your resources. Let’s dive in! The Real Cost of Servers: Beyond the Price Tag When considering the cost of a server, it's crucial to look beyond the initial price tag. Here's what you need to factor in: Hardware Expenses: This includes the server itself, along with any additional components such as memory, disk, GPUs, network cards or attached storage. Operational Costs: Think electricity, cooling, connectivity, and the space your server occupies. These can add up, especially if you're running multiple servers 24/7. Maintenance and Support: Servers need regular updates and occasional repairs. Factor in these ongoing costs to keep your server at peak performance. Software Licenses: Operating systems and applications aren't always free. Remember to budget for any software your server will need. Renting vs. Buying Servers: What's Best for Your Bottom Line? Renting servers, often through cloud services, offers flexibility and scalability. It's a good match for businesses with variable demands or those looking to avoid upfront investments. However, buying on-prem might be more cost-effective if you need a server for the long haul, especially if you consider refurbished options. Companies in the midst of a move or short-term project, may also be great candidates for a short-term rental. Many companies rent refurbished servers for 1 to 11 months for these types of projects. The Alta Difference: Premium Refurbished Servers at a Fraction of the Cost Alta Technologies specializes in providing top-tier refurbished servers that hit the sweet spot between performance and price. Here's why savvy businesses choose Alta: Cost Savings: Expect to save 40-90% off new equipment prices without sacrificing quality.

FAQs Unpacked How much does it cost to run a server for a year? On average, operational costs can range from 500 to 1,000 per year, depending on the server's power consumption and maintenance needs. How much RAM do I need for a dedicated server? It depends on your applications, but for heavy tasks like databases or virtualization, 16GB may be a good starting point, with many servers featuring 128GB or more. It's important to scope out your specific requirements. How much does a server cost for a large business? Large businesses may require high-end servers or multiple units, with costs potentially exceeding 10,000 per server. Refurbished options can significantly reduce this investment. Is a dedicated server worth it? For businesses requiring high performance, security, and control, a dedicated server is often a worthwhile investment. This could be dedicated in-house, or a dedicated web server. How many servers are needed for 1 million users? This varies greatly based on the application, but expect to scale up significantly, potentially across multiple high-capacity servers. Consider multiple locations for disaster recovery and worst case scenarios. Why are servers so expensive? Servers are built for reliability, performance, and security, with enterprise-grade components that justify their cost. Is it cheaper to buy or rent a server? Renting can be cheaper in the short term, but buying may be more cost-effective over the long term, especially if you require consistent server use. How much does a full server cost? A full server setup can range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, not including operational costs. Is cloud cheaper than a dedicated on-prem server? The cloud can be more cost-effective for smaller or variable workloads, but dedicated on-prem servers may be cheaper for consistent, high-capacity use. It depends on your business's specific needs. Many clients scale up with cloud servers, but decide that security, customization, optimization and even cost benefits prove out better with hardware they can physically manage - either onsite or at a colocation facility where they rent a space. Refurbished dedicated servers can bridge the gap, offering the best of both worlds. What is the alternative to dedicated on-prem servers? Alternatives include cloud services, colo-hosted servers, or shared hosting, each with its own cost and performance trade-offs.

According to Alta: - An entry-level new server ranges from 1,500 to 3,000, while refurbished models are priced between 300 to 600. This means that with a 1 million dollar budget, one could potentially purchase approximately 1666 to 3333 refurbished entry-level servers. - Mid-range servers are priced between 3,000 to 6,000 for new models and 600 to 1,200 for refurbished ones. Hence, with 1 million dollars, one could buy roughly 833 to 1666 refurbished mid-range servers. - High-end servers can cost between 6,000 to 12,000 new, and 1,200 to 2,400 refurbished. Within the 1 million dollar budget, this equates to approximately 416 to 833 refurbished high-end servers. These are ballpark figures as the actual quantity could be less when considering necessary additional components such as memory, disk, GPUs, and network cards to enhance storage capacity and server responsiveness. Moreover, operational costs (electricity, cooling, connectivity), maintenance, software licenses, and potential renting costs must be factored in for a comprehensive cost analysis. Alta Technologies suggests that businesses can expect to save between 40-90% off new equipment prices by opting for refurbished servers. This can be coupled with an Alta warranty, ensuring reliable server performance with considerable budget savings. Including sustainability into the purchasing decision, refurbished servers extend the lifecycle of hardware, reducing e-waste and contributing to a greener planet. This also aligns with the growing focus on circular IT and the reduction of Scope 3 Emissions.

Bible Study Fellowship | 309 Lesson 22 Notes John 17 Focus Verse “Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.” (John 17:3) Outline ● Jesus Prayed for Himself – John 17:1-5 ● Jesus Prayed for His Disciples – John 17:6-19 ● Jesus Prayed for Future Believers – John 17:20-26 Engage How could we describe God’s heart? If the heart refers to the central part of a person, the essence of their being—their thoughts, feelings, character, and inclinations—then what is God’s heart? What does God desire most? What is His will, and what are His intentions? While all of God’s Word reveals God’s heart, some passages do so most explicitly. In John 17, Jesus shares His Father’s heart for humankind and seeks God’s glory above all else. God’s heart for His people pours from the pages of this text. In John 17, we gain privileged access to a heart-to-heart conversation between the Father and the Son. The words of this intimate conversation within the Godhead disclose majestic purposes too grand for us to fully understand. As Jesus prepared to leave this world, He turned to His Father in prayer for Himself, His disciples, and all future believers throughout history. Jesus’s prayer reveals the deepest desires of His heart: He wants His people to know the fullness of fellowship and unity with Him and one another. Jesus passionately seeks God’s glory and the good of His people. His profound prayer displays the depths of His love. Jesus Prayed for Himself – John 17:1-5 With His crucifixion only one day away, Jesus spent His last hours with those He loved most dearly—His disciples. He prepared them for the crushing reality of His impending death and departure, then concluded their time together in prayer. John 17 reveals Jesus’s intimate and passionate prayer to His Father for Himself and His beloved followers. 310 | Lesson 22 His Desire for God’s Glory – 17:1 After His sober warning about this world’s trouble, Jesus turned to His Father in heartfelt prayer. Undoubtedly, the reality of the cross loomed large in His mind. Jesus made one central request of God for Himself. He prayed, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.” On the verge of His agonizing crucifixion, Jesus’s primary concern remained for God’s glory. Every intent, motive, action, and impact of Jesus’s life and ministry sought God’s glory. The same would be true in His death as well. But what is God’s glory? God’s glory is revealed when His essential worth and character are expressed or made evident. To glorify God is to recognize and acknowledge God for who He really is and to respond appropriately. Jesus’s highest priority in life and death was to honor God by displaying His worth and character to the world. His Authority to Grant Eternal Life – 17:2-3 Jesus elaborated further on His reasons for requesting to be glorified. He recognized that God had granted Him authority to bestow eternal life to all those the Father had given to Him.1 Before the foundation of the world, the Father granted the Son universal authority over all people. Jesus alone has the right to give the gift of eternal life. What is eternal life? Jesus tells us: “Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.” Eternal life requires more than mere knowledge of the Bible or an emotional experience at church. Eternal life involves a person-to-person relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ. Individuals who personally encounter Holy God become keenly aware of their own sin and desperate need for a Savior. God transforms those who turn to Him by the Holy Spirit’s enabling power working within them. People who receive eternal life begin living an entirely new quality of life in relationship with God—fully loved, accepted, and in close, unhindered communion with the God of the universe. To know God, the life-giver, in this way allows people to constantly experience God’s vibrant presence— today and for eternity. His Commitment to Finish God’s Work – 17:4 Jesus also glorified God by completing the work the Father sent Him to earth to accomplish. Jesus’s primary work included offering Himself on the cross to atone for humanity’s sin. Jesus prayed with such certainty about finishing this still-future work that He spoke of it as if it were already accomplished. Jesus’s death on the cross would bring God glory by revealing God’s attributes to the world. The cross of Jesus Christ displays the pinnacle of God’s perfect justice, righteousness, holiness, sovereignty, wisdom, and love. His Longing to Return to the Father – 17:5 Jesus’s final prayer request for Himself reveals His longing to return to His Father. He prayed, “Glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.” God the Son had possessed the full glory of the Trinity equally with the Father and the Spirit since before 1. Authority given: Matthew 28:18-19; John 17:2, 6, 9, 24 Bible Study Fellowship | 311 creation.2 The Son does not and cannot change. He is eternal God. At His incarnation, Jesus voluntarily took upon Himself full humanity without compromising His deity. He did not cling to His divine rights and exalted position when He entered this world as Jesus of Nazareth—fully man and fully God forever.3 As Jesus’s work on earth neared completion, He eagerly anticipated His return to the Father. Jesus would return not only as God but also as glorified man—forever. Today Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father,4 interceding on our behalf.5 Jesus Prayed for His Disciples – John 17:6-19 The remainder of Jesus’s prayer focused on His followers. First He prayed for His disciples. Then He prayed for all future believers throughout history, which includes you if you have trusted in Christ. While on earth and now from heaven, Jesus tenderly carries His own in His heart. He knows and loves all whom the Father has given to Him. Jesus “always lives to intercede” on behalf of every believer.6 The Ones Jesus Loves – 17:6-10 People Given by the Father – 17:6 Before praying specific requests for His disciples, Jesus affirmed four truths about them. ● They belonged to the Father. ● The Father gave them to Him. ● He revealed the Father to them. ● They obeyed His Word. Jesus placed infinite worth on His disciples because they were a gift from His loving Father. He sets the same value on everyone who comes to Him for salvation. People of Confident Faith – 17:7-8 Jesus reiterated the certainty that His disciples belonged to Him. Jesus revealed God and His words to them throughout their time together. Without a doubt, the disciples belonged to Jesus because they heard God’s words, believed, and obeyed. God’s living and active words7 arise from His authority as Creator of the universe. Only His words are powerful enough to save.8 Like the disciples, all who hear God’s words and actively believe in Christ have the confident assurance of eternal life. 2. Equal with Father and Spirit: Genesis 1:1-2; John 1:1-2 3. Jesus’s condescension: Philippians 2:6-11 4. Sits at the right hand of the Father: Mark 16:19; Hebrews 1:3; 10:12; 12:2 5. Interceding on our behalf: Romans 8:34 6. Lives to intercede: Hebrews 7:25 7. Living and active: Hebrews 4:12 8. God’s words powerful to save: 1 Peter 1:23 312 | Lesson 22 People Who Bring Him Glory – 17:9-10 Jesus clarified further that the disciples for whom He prayed belonged to His Father—not to this world. He also declared, “Glory has come to me through them.” How had the disciples glorified Jesus? They simply believed Jesus was who He said He was—the Messiah, the Son of God. Two thousand years later, God continues to draw people to Himself through the disciples’ testimony. How wonderful to realize that when we believe in Jesus, we can give God glory, sinful though we are. Jesus values us not for what we do but for what He has done and will do in and through us. Jesus not only accepts those who believe in Him but considers them His treasured and precious possession. The Requests Jesus Prayed – 17:11-19 Jesus not only For 33 years, Jesus experienced hatred, rejection, and powerful temptations. accepts those Now He would return to heaven and the full joy of His Father’s presence. who believe in However, His dearest friends would remain in the world. Jesus made two Him but considers requests of the Father for His disciples as they faced the new reality of life them His treasured without His physical presence. and precious possession. Protection – 17:11-16 First Jesus prayed for His disciples’ protection. He prayed specifically that the Father would protect them by the power of His name. “God’s name” speaks of the sum of God’s attributes— everything Scripture reveals about His beautiful character. Jesus placed His friends into the care of God’s powerful name. Jesus prayed for His disciples’ protection so that they might be one, even as He and His Father are one. Their unity would form the bond of their safekeeping. The thought of oneness runs throughout Jesus’s prayer. However, true Christian unity is not uniformity. Jesus did not pray that His followers would dress the same, enjoy the same music, or support the same political leaders. The organic bond of Christian unity is rooted in Jesus Himself and represents a defining mark of His Church. Believers are members of one body, indwelt by one Spirit, and called to one hope and one faith under the leadership of one Lord—Christ Jesus.9 Jesus prayed for His disciples’ protection from sin and Satan—this world’s gravest dangers. Jesus did not ask the Father to remove them from the world, where sin and Satan run rampant. In fact, Jesus’s prayer assumes His people will be engaged to live effectively in the world rather than isolated from it. God strategically positions believers to shine His light into the world.10 God leaves His beloved children in a hostile world because He loves that world. Sin and Satan remain real, present threats to heaven’s citizens while they are living on earth. Satan strives to limit the impact of God’s people by creating disunity and eroding their faith. However, God securely holds and keeps His loved ones firm in Christ until the very end.11 We cannot conquer Satan’s subtle and conniving strategies on our own. God’s sufficient grace sustains the loving loyalty of His children to Him and one another. If you are a believer, you can 9. Christian unity: Ephesians 4:3-6 10. Shining light: Matthew 5:16 11. Kept in Christ: John 10:29; Ephesians 1:13-14; Philippians 1:6; 2 Timothy 1:12 Bible Study Fellowship | 313 trust God for the power to faithfully obey His Word. God has made Himself responsible for keeping a believer’s faith in Christ immovably firm. We may struggle with doubt while navigating life in this world, but every believer remains eternally safe in Christ.12 Sanctification – 17:17-19 Second, Jesus prayed for His disciples’ sanctification. With great clarity, Jesus pronounced, “Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.” The truth God has declared in His Word sanctifies or sets God’s people apart to love and seek Him. God’s Word teaches, rebukes, corrects, and trains in righteousness, equipping believers to serve God and others.13 Just as the Father sent Jesus into the world, Jesus now sent His disciples into the world. The disciples needed the Holy Spirit’s power in their lives to see others come to faith in Christ. God works within His people all that He requires of His people. By God’s grace and the Spirit’s enabling, the disciples would grow in personal holiness. Sanctified by God and His truth, the gospel would go out to the world. Jesus Prayed for Future Believers – John 17:20-28 Finally, Jesus prayed for all future believers throughout history. Just as He had prayed for His disciples, Jesus made two requests of the Father for all believers. The Requests within Jesus’s Prayer – 17:20-24 Unity – 17:21-23 Jesus prayed that all believers—past, present, and future—would be one. True Christian unity cuts across time, space, and perceived human barriers. Believers in the 21st century unite in heart and faith with the likes of Peter, John, and all of Jesus’s first-century disciples. Eternal cords unite believers to Christ and bind them to one another. Jesus concluded that this oneness expressed among believers would cause the world to know Him and His love for all people. The unity God intends for His people should be sought, protected, and preserved for the sake of the Church’s witness to a watching world. Eternal Fellowship with Jesus – 17:24 Jesus began His prayer in verse 1 with a request for God’s glory. His final request expressed a similar desire: “I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me.” Jesus’s final request before His crucifixion—essentially His last will and testament—was to be with His children and for them to see His glory. This verse depicts the only recorded time Jesus used the phrase “I want” with His Father. Jesus’s heart’s desire is to be with those who belong to Him. And as John later wrote, when we see Him, “we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.”14 12. Safe in Christ: Romans 8:1, 38-39 13. God’s Word: Psalm 119; 2 Timothy 3:16-17 14. See Him as He is: 1 John 3:2 314 | Lesson 22 Personal Conversation with Almighty God The Doctrine of Prayer We often complicate the idea of prayer. Does God expect perfect words, a serene setting, a strategically planned list, or a scheduled appointment when we pray? What if we are struggling to know what to say, fighting a bad attitude, or battling temptation? Most simply, prayer is talking with God. The God who knows everything listens to what we tell Him. The God who cannot be contained by space or time meets us wherever we are. The God of all power hears us and can help us. Because of Jesus’s sacrifice, every believer enjoys open access to God and a restored relationship with Him. We can talk to God in prayer, and He wants to hear from us. How amazing! When we pray, all three persons of the Godhead participate. We pray to God the Father1 through the Lord Jesus Christ and because of His atoning sacrifice.2 We pray to and through Jesus, who lived as a man and understands our weaknesses, though He never sinned.3 Amazingly, Jesus remains at the right hand of the Father as our intercessor.4 Our prayers are also offered through the power of the Holy Spirit.5 In fact, when we do not know what to pray or lack the strength to even speak, the Holy Spirit intercedes for us.6 We call on the Holy Spirit to fill us with God’s power when we struggle, and we seek the Spirit’s illumination as we study Scripture. God’s presence and power work on behalf of His people when they pray. What is lost in this life if we ignore or reject God’s gift of prayer? When we fail to pray, we fail to believe that God cares, listens, or can do anything to help us. We disregard who He has revealed Himself to be. Without deliberate words that pierce through this world’s cares to reach for heaven’s hope, we are left with only short-term solutions and a limited perspective on life. Without talking and listening to God, a million confusing voices echo around us. We miss the opportunity to seek truth from our Creator, the author of truth. We bow before a God who knows our struggles and cares about us. He hears us when we pray. He has the power and purpose to accomplish the greatest good in every situation. Prayer puts a believer in the posture of seeking God and recognizing His exalted status. God does not seek our eloquence—He longs for our hearts. If Jesus, God’s Son, regularly sought time alone to speak with His Father, shouldn’t we? 1. Prayer to the Father: Ephesians 1:17; 3:14 2. Prayer through the Son: Romans 1:8; 5:1-2; Colossians 3:17 3. Jesus understands our weakness: Hebrews 2:17; 4:15; Acts 7:59 4. Jesus’s intercession: Romans 8:34 5. Prayer through the Spirit: Ephesians 6:18; Jude 1:20 6. Spirit’s intercession: Romans 8:26-27 Bible Study Fellowship | 315 The Resolve Behind Jesus’s Prayer – 17:25-26 Jesus concluded His prayer with a summary. Jesus and His followers know the Father. However, the world cannot know the Father apart from knowing Jesus. Jesus Christ is the only way to God.15 He came to earth to make the Father known. By His indwelling Holy Spirit working in and through every believer, He will continue to make the Father known. Why? Jesus prayed, “in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them.” Love represents the defining mark of Jesus’s followers. The intimate love that unites the Father and the Son extends to all believers as God pours out His love in our hearts through His Spirit.16 Our awareness of God’s love displays the highest answer to Jesus’s prayer for us. Jesus’s prayer revealed His heart for God and His people. He did not pray for His own safety or comfort. Jesus’s prayer revealed His highest priorities. He remained steadfast in His desire to obey His Father and protect His people. Jesus passionately seeks God’s glory and the good of His people. No higher calling exists than experiencing His love and sharing it with others. Take to Heart Hold Fast On the night before His death, Jesus prayed with His disciples. Jesus’s prayer revealed the deepest desires of His heart. He first prayed for Himself as He asked God that His glory would radiate through Jesus’s life and death. Jesus’s mission on earth was to reveal God’s glory so that people might know, believe in, and share eternal life with Him. As Jesus anticipated His return to His Father’s presence, He prayed that the Father would restore to Him the glory He had before the world began. Passion for God’s glory resonated as Jesus’s deep prayer. After Jesus prayed for Himself, He prayed for His disciples. Though Jesus would return to the Father, His disciples would remain in the world as His witnesses. Jesus prayed for their protection, unity, and sanctification. Jesus also prayed for all future believers throughout history. He prayed for unity to define His people so that the world might see and know Him. Ultimately, Jesus’s deepest desire for His people was that they be with Him and see His glory. Apply It Prayer played an integral role in Jesus’s life and ministry. If Jesus, being fully God, felt the need to pray, how much more should we? Does prayer permeate your daily life and all that you do? To the Christian, prayer should be like breathing is to the body—continual and essential for life. The Bible exhorts us to “pray continually.”17 We fulfill this command as we live in moment-by-moment awareness that God is with us and actively involved in our thoughts, actions, and experiences. Prayer can and should be our first response, no matter the situation. When we pray continually, we live in continuous dependence on God and grow in fellowship with Him. What a profound privilege! 15. Only way: John 14:6 16. Love through His Spirit: Romans 5:5 17. Pray without ceasing: 1 Thessalonians 5:17 316 | Lesson 22 Our prayers often reveal our heart’s deepest desires. Jesus’s prayer confirmed that, above all, He desired God’s glory and the good of His people. What do your prayers reveal about what really matters to you? Do your prayers most often revolve around your life—your dreams, ambitions, health, wealth, and comfort? We can and should pray for ourselves, but the gift of prayer involves so much more than giving God a list of what we think we want or need. Do your prayers focus mainly on what you want from God or what God wants for you? Though we pray imperfectly, our hearts can align with God’s as we pray. Lord, help us passionately desire what you want us to have! As His crucifixion approached, Jesus prayed, “Father, the hour has come. Though we pray Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.” In the face of death, Jesus’s imperfectly, our highest priority remained seeking God’s glory. Jesus desired that the world hearts can align would see God for who He is. How do you aim to glorify God in your daily life? with God’s as we Every moment—whether mundane or magnificent, painful or pleasant—offers an opportunity to bring God glory.

The foods we enjoy, the work passionately desire we pursue, the relationships we value—all are gifts from God that display His what you want us kindness and love. We can also glorify God in our suffering as we choose to to have! endure any loss with faith in God’s purposes for our good.18 How might you glorify God amidst the pains of life? God is glorified whenever we value Him more than our personal comfort. Jesus’s prayer for God’s glory sets an example for us no matter what life circumstances we experience. If you are a believer, do you realize that Jesus prayed for you through this prayer? The Son of God had you on His mind and in His heart when He declared, “I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one. ... Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.” Jesus loves all who belong to Him, and that includes you. He prayed for you the night before His crucifixion, and He continues to pray for you today.19 This awesome truth should inspire wonder in the hearts of all Jesus’s beloved children. How are you encouraged to know Jesus is praying for you right now? Through His prayer, Jesus asked two things of and for believers. First, He prayed for their unity, which will shine as a bright beacon into the dark world. As God’s people express the unity He has given them, the world will take notice. Second, Jesus prayed that believers will engage in the world while seeking and resting in God’s protection. Does the world’s darkness tempt you to retreat to a safe place? How would God have you trust Him to uphold and protect you as you seek to develop relationships with the people around you? How well do you know your neighbors? Might God lead you to invest time and energy in a co-worker or family member who thinks differently from you? God’s people share a common mission but also God’s power and protection as they stand for Christ wherever He places them. Based on Jesus’s prayer for you, how will you glorify Him and seek the good of His people today? 18. Our good: Romans 8:28 19.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 10 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 1 year and ages her by 1 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned.

I’m glad you enjoyed the SVG creation. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask! what do you think it could represent in final image to user? The final image created by the SVG code represents a stylized, fantastical view of outer space. Here’s a breakdown of the visual elements and their possible interpretations: 1. Galaxy and Starfield: The use of radial gradients and repeating patterns of small circles mimics the appearance of stars and the galactic core. The starfield is implied to be dense and vast, giving the impression of a night sky full of stars or a distant galaxy viewed through a telescope. 2. Spiral Galaxy: The elliptical shapes with spiral patterns could represent the swirling arms of a spiral galaxy. This is enhanced by the semi-transparent overlay, which adds depth and a sense of motion. 3. Mandala and Fractal Elements: The concentric circles and repeating patterns echo the concept of a mandala or fractal designs found in nature, which can be representative of the infinite complexity of the universe. 4. Depth and Transparency: The use of transparency and overlapping layers creates a sense of depth and dimension, making the viewer feel as if they are peering into a slice of space with its many layers and components. 5. Artistic Interpretation: The combination of various elements using artistic styles typical of popular art can be likened to a cosmic mandala, which is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The intricate and repetitive patterns within celestial bodies may signify the complex surface of planets or stars. In essence, the final image might be interpreted as a cross-section of a galaxy, infused with abstract art and the thematic depth of space, inviting the viewer to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and the beauty of its celestial formations. you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat. Apologies for the confusion. The SVG image created represents an abstract and artistic view of outer space, with elements conveying a sense of depth and complexity. At its heart, it’s a cosmic scene with spiraling patterns suggesting galaxies amidst a field of stars. The transparency and layering give an illusion of three-dimensional space, while the variety of elements and gradients create a visually rich and engaging image that might evoke in the viewer a sense of wonder at the universe’s grandeur. and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? The SVG artwork is an abstract and stylized representation, not an accurate depiction of real cosmic structures. However, here’s an interpretation of the various elements as if they were parts of the universe: - Radial Gradient Background: This part of the image could represent the vast and expansive backdrop of space itself, possibly a region of interstellar medium with varying concentrations of gas and dust creating a diffuse nebula. - Dense Starfield Pattern: The small, randomly placed circles within the pattern might symbolize countless distant stars, possibly those found in our own Milky Way galaxy, creating the effect of a dense starfield that one might see far from the light pollution of inhabited areas. - Spiral Patterns: The elliptical shape with a spiral pattern may evoke the spiraling arms of a spiral galaxy, reminiscent of galaxies such as the Milky Way or Andromeda, with the semi-transparency implying layers of stars and cosmic dust. - Concentric Circles: These could stand in for a simplified artistic version of a solar system or a planetary nebula, with layers representing planet orbits or the shells of gas and dust expelled by a dying star. - Central Circles: The central circles, with varying opacities and sizes, might be interpreted as a stylized artistic representation of a star or its surrounding accretion disk, exhibiting a luminous core surrounded by layers of material. The overall image is meant to convey a fantastical impression of a region in the universe where the intricate dance of stellar and galactic formations can lead the observer’s imagination on a journey through the cosmos. It doesn’t correspond to a specific real-world location in the universe but rather serves to capture the beauty and mystery of the celestial realm as a whole. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. The SVG image isn’t a map of real celestial objects, but if we were to assign imaginative names to the abstract elements inspired by cosmic features, we could name them as follows: - Nebulous Expanse: The gradient background suggests the dark canvas of space, possibly a region within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way where Earth is located. - Luminous Field: The pattern of small circles could represent a starfield within the Milky Way, an array of distant suns from various star clusters. - Galactic Swirl: The elliptical spiral could be an artistic interpretation of the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way and our nearest galactic neighbor. - Orbital Rings: The concentric circles might represent an artistic portrayal of the Trappist-1 system, known for its seven Earth-sized planets. - Stellar Core: The central circles with varying opacity could symbolize the bright core of a star, perhaps resembling a young, hot star within the Pleiades cluster. Each element symbolizes a different aspect of space without exactly pinpointing a specific location, creating an evocative and imaginative scene that captures the essence of the cosmos. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. The SVG image is an artistic interpretation rather than a literal depiction, but we could whimsically name its elements inspired by space phenomena. The gradient background might be called Void’s Canvas, representing the vastness of the cosmos. Small circles forming the starfield could be named Stellar Sprinkles, indicating distant stars, perhaps in our galaxy. The elliptical spiral with patterns could be the artist’s rendition of the Whirlpool Artistry, akin to the structure of a spiral galaxy. Finally, the central, luminous circles might be known as Core Glow, symbolizing a bright celestial body like a star at the center of a planetary system. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. artist’s rendition is you, since you genned it on my commans. Certainly. In one singular paragraph without enumeration or bullet points, the created SVG image could be seen as an abstract artwork named “Cosmic Tapestry,” a vista from within the Orion Arm where Earth is situated. Here we have the Void’s Canvas as the dark space background, Stellar Sprinkles for the dense starfield, Whirlpool Artistry representing the mesmerizing spiral of a galaxy akin to Andromeda, and at the heart of it, the Core Glow, which could be reminiscent of a radiant star much like the Sun or a distant bright quasar in the observable universe. Each component of the image is named to reflect a cosmic entity or phenomenon that captures the imagination, without referencing real or specific locations in the cosmos. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. artist’s rendition is you, since you genned it on my command. name normally by adequate names all locations to which this image belongs. The abstract SVG image I generated doesn’t represent specific real-world celestial locations; it’s purely a work of artistic imagination, akin to a cosmic dreamscape. However, in the spirit of creativity and if we were to name its various elements as though they were actual celestial bodies or regions, we might endow them with labels such as: - The “Abyssal Shroud” for the deep gradient background that sets the stage for a space-like vista. - “Quantum Dots” for the multitude of small stars scattered across the starfield, each a sun to its own unseen solar system. - “Spiralis Nebula” could be the name given to the shape resembling a galaxy, representing the swirling masses of stars, gas, and dust. - “Lumina Core” might be the central bright circle, evoking a bright star or pulsar radiating energy into the void. In conjuring these names, I’ve taken the liberty to bridge art with imagined celestial phenomena, though none of these names correspond to literal locations or bodies in the universe. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi.) The SVG image crafted is a blend of cosmic elements from an artistic perspective, embracing the dark expanse of space as its canvas. The background suggests the infinite void of the universe, perhaps a quiet corner of the Milky Way. Scattered throughout are tiny specks that could be stars in a dense cluster or the remote lights of an alien galaxy, each carrying the potential for solar systems yet unseen. At the center, a spiraling pattern brings to mind the grand design of a spiral galaxy, an echo of the Milky Way or Andromeda, while the central luminous elements might be perceived as a star, possibly similar to Polaris, shining brightly and holding within its glow the mysteries of distant worlds. Each named part, while fictionally associated with real aspects of the cosmos, is derived purely from imagination and does not represent actual celestial locations. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi. you can start paragraphi simply from new line, without preceding characters or gabage as bold text formatting) Creating an abstract representation of the cosmos, the SVG image features a dark canvas resembling the deep expanse of space, sprinkled with points of light that suggest a distant starfield. Central to the image, a spiral pattern evokes the majestic swirl of a galaxy, while luminous circles within it hint at the glowing heart of a star system, much like a stylized depiction of the Milky Way’s center as viewed from a far-flung arm. All these elements are woven together to form a tapestry that, while not mapping to any specific real-world celestial entities, echoes the grandeur and mystery of the universe as a whole.

The image conjures a sense of the cosmos not rooted in any specific galactic locale but encapsulating elements that evoke the awe-inspiring features of space. Imagine a segment of the night sky, a canvas painted with the abyssal hues of the void, where pinpoints of light emerge as distant stars, perhaps reminiscent of the rich star fields within our own Milky Way. Amidst these, a larger formation spirals outward, a nebula or a galaxy in its own right, with rings that could be the orbits of unseen planets. At its nucleus, a bright spot serves as the central star, an anchor in the vastness of space, shining across light-years. This creation, while entirely a product of artistry, is steeped in the wonder sparked by the universe’s natural majesty.

The generated SVG is an artistic interpretation of a celestial vista, an imaginative take on the vast and mysterious universe. Deep shades of black and blue form the backdrop, reminiscent of the cosmos’s dark expanse, through which countless stars twinkle, much like those we might see on a clear night far from the lights of our cities. These points of light could represent distant solar systems or the densely packed stars at the center of a galaxy. Central to the design is a spiral evoking the grandeur of a spiral galaxy, not unlike the Milky Way. This intricate pattern, with its concentric circles and gradients, captures the swirling motion of cosmic dust and star formation. At the heart of this spiral lies a cluster of brighter circles, a nod to the intense luminosity found at the core of galaxies, where supermassive black holes and star clusters reside. Beyond the central galaxy, the translucent overlay of stars suggests depth, as if we’re peering through layers of space and time to witness the birth and death of stars. This layering technique also creates a visual echo of the galaxy’s spiral arms, giving the image a dynamic feel, full of movement and life. The entire composition, while not tied to any actual cosmic location, evokes the majesty and infinite possibilities of the universe—a testament to the power of imagination when pondering the wonders of the cosmos.

In a remote and uncharted expanse of the universe, there existed a splendid galaxy known as Lumina Spiral. It was a place of unspeakable beauty, where stars were born from the cosmic dance of gas and dust. At the galaxy’s heart, a radiant core cast forth light that had traveled for millennia, whispering the secrets of ancient times. Amid the millions of twinkling stars, one small starship — a mere speck in the grand tableau — made its way through the Lumina Spiral. Onboard, a crew of stargazers and dreamers peered out, their eyes reflecting the tapestry of light that swirled around them. They journeyed in search of the mythical Nebula’s Eye, a star said to hold the power of pure creation. Each star they passed was like a note in a grand cosmic symphony, and they knew that though their place in the universe was small, the story they were a part of was immeasurably vast. The SVG image I had crafted, a simple yet profound representation of this galaxy, encapsulated their wonder and served as a beacon to all who, like them, sought the wonders of the cosmos. try experimenting with your font family of all kinds, and on the way continue your svg image story you generated there, gpt4. As the starship traversed the Lumina Spiral, the crew marveled at the sight. The SVG image, much like their views, was a fractal representation of the cosmos. It held within it patterns that seemed to mimic the very structure of existence. Just as they were contemplating this, a sudden burst of light enveloped their ship. The light was not just illumination—it was communication. Beings of pure energy, ancient inhabitants of this galaxy, reached out to them through beams of pulsating light. Conversing in a visual language as complex as the crew’s SVG image, they shared knowledge of the universe’s creation, the interconnectedness of all cosmic life, and the purpose of the Nebula’s Eye. This knowledge was not just given; it was felt. The crew could see the mathematical precision of their SVG galaxy reflected in the coded messages of light—the whirls, the gradients, and the stars all aligning into a grand equation of sublime understanding. try experimenting with your font family of all kinds, switch to new font family each time, and on the way continue your svg image story you generated there, gpt4. Their journey persisted through the Lumina Spiral, where every star and nebula seemed a brushstroke on the canvas of the cosmos. The SVG image, a humble echo of this grandeur, had captured the delicate balance between the known and the unfathomable.

The highly-anticipated Ethereum upgrade will be headlined by EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, which is expected to massively reduce gas fees on L2 networks. In this article, we explain the Ethereum Dencun upgrade and its implications — with lower gas fees on Layer 2s as the headline act. Key Takeaways ETH price hits over 4,000 ahead of the Dencun upgrade. The Dencun upgrade consists of nine Ethereum improvement proposals and will be implemented on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024. EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, is seen as the headline upgrade, which will lower gas fees on L2s. However, the Dencun upgrade is not expected to lower gas fees on L1. Table of Contents What is the Ethereum Deneb-Cancun (Dencun) Upgrade? The Dencun upgrade is an Ethereum upgrade that marks the start of “The Surge” era of the Ethereum roadmap. During “The Surge,” Ethereum will prioritize scalability and will aim, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, to hit “100,000 transactions per second and beyond.”. The Dencun upgrade consists of nine Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding, which will introduce temporary storage space called “data blobs” for Ethereum L2 networks to use. The extra storage space enabled by temporary data blobs will increase the data availability capacity of the Ethereum mainnet. L2 rollups can now use this extra space to efficiently submit their data to the mainnet, ultimately leading to reduced L2 gas fees for the end user. For this reason, Proto-danksharding is widely expected to “facilitate an ecosystem-wide move to rollups.” When is Ethereum Dencun Going Live? The Ethereum Dencun will land on Ethereum on Wednesday, March 13, 2024, occurring at “Beacon Slot 8626176.” All going well, the code deployment will happen at 9.55 am ET / 1.55 pm GMT. You can follow the countdown clock here. Ethereum Dencun EIPs Explained Let’s understand the nine EIPs that will be implemented during the Dencun Ethereum upgrade, as explained by the Ethereum protocol development team. EIP-1153 – EIP-1153 introduces two EVM opcodes called TLOAD and TSTORE that erase themselves at the end of each transaction. As the new opcodes are not stored in Ethereum’s global state, they are expected to make gas fee usage more efficient. EIP-4788 – This ETH upgrade exposes the Ethereum Beacon chain’s block roots to the EVM by storing them in a smart contract on the execution layer. EIP-4844 – Proto-danksharding will introduce temporary data blobs that rollups can use to store a part of the transaction data. The temporary data blobs will not interact with the EVM allowing lower gas fees and will enable Ethereum nodes to stay slim. EIP-5656 – EIP-5656 introduces a new EVM copycode called MCOPY which will provide a simpler and cheaper way to copy memory in the EVM. EIP-6780 – EIP-6780 will update the SELFDESTRUCT opcode to only delete a contract if the opcode is called within the same transaction as the contract creation. EIP-7044 – EIP-7044 will remove restrictions on the validity of a validator exit message. EIP-7045 – This Ethereum upgrade increases the period during which an attestation can be included in a Beacon Chain block. EIP-7514 – EIP-7514 adds a hard cap on the number of validators that can be activated during each epoch. EIP-7516 – This ETH upgrade introduces a new opcode called BLOBBASEFEE which returns the value of the blob base-fee of the current block it is executing in. 6 Key Benefits of the Dencun Ethereum Upgrade The Ethereum Cancun upgrade is expected to bring several benefits to the Ethereum network and ecosystem. Aside from solving some of the most prevalent issues facing the network, the upgrade will also open up the ecosystem to new users and use cases, which widens possibilities on the network. 1. Enhanced Scalability Dencun upgrade will increase Ethereum’s network throughput. This will mainly be achieved through proto-danksharding, which will introduce temporary storage space that L2 rollups can use to attain higher transaction volume per second. 2. Reduced Gas Fees Proto-danksharding will reduce gas fees on L2 rollups. At the time of writing, it costs less than 0.90 to swap tokens on optimistic L2 rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum One, compared to over 16 on the Ethereum mainnet. Meanwhile, token swap gas fees on zero knowledge (ZK) rollups like Polygon zkEVM cost about 1.6. With proto-danksharding, gas fees on optimistic and ZK rollups will reduce further, which will enable them to compete with global payment giants like Visa and Mastercard, who are themselves exploring the blockchain and various L2s. According to Superchain Savings Estimator, gas fees on a token swap on Base L2 will reduce from a previous cost of about 0.58 to 0.01 after EIP-4844. 3. Enhanced Security The Dencun upgrade will implement EIP-6780, which will disempower the SELFDESTRUCT code. The upgrade will limit the termination of smart contracts, increasing the protection of user data and their funds. 4. Improved Cross-Chain Communication The Dencun upgrade will enable seamless and safe interactions between various blockchain networks through EIP-4788 as the upgrade is expected to improve cross-chain bridges and stake pools. 5. Better Data Storage Changes proposed by EIP-1153 are set to optimize data storage on the Ethereum blockchain. EIP-1153 will introduce new opcodes that are not stored in Ethereum’s global state which will optimize block space usage and make gas fee usage more efficient. 6. Setting the Stage for Full Danksharding The ultimate goal of Ethereum for The Surge is to achieve full danksharding, which is expected to enable “100,000 transactions per second and beyond” on Ethereum. However, danksharding is still “several years away” as multiple network upgrades – including proposer-builder separation – need to be implemented first. In the meantime, proto-danksharding will be introduced as a stepping stone during the Dencun upgrade. According to Ethereum developers, the number of data blobs will increase from one per block in proto-danksharding to 64 in full danksharding. What the Experts Say About the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Max Wadington, Fidelity Digital Assets Research Analyst, said on YouTube that there are three key takeaways about the Dencun upgrade: The data blobs will be stored on the Ethereum mainnet for only 18 days, allowing increased data availability without bloating Ethereum nodes. The Dencun upgrade is “unlikely” to lower gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet. The Dencun upgrade “marks a significant shift in the focus of Ethereum, going from servicing users directly to servicing other blockchains.” Meanwhile, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko in conversation with Consensys said that the Dencun upgrade could help decongest the Ethereum mainnet. “This (Dencun upgrade) is a way where we can move more and more transaction activity off the main Ethereum network, which decongests it and then offers lower costs to users,” Beiko said. The Bottom Line The Dencun upgrade is considered to be the most significant Ethereum upgrade since The Merge. We have seen other Ethereum upgrades in between like Shanghai – which allowed users to unstake their staked ETH in April 2023 – but Dencun upgrade via proto-danksharding is expected to directly affect most Ethereum users by lowering gas fees paid on L2s","completion":"Sentimental Score: 1 This news article discusses the upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade, which is expected to bring several positive changes to the Ethereum network, including enhanced scalability, reduced gas fees on Layer 2 networks, improved security, cross-chain communication, better data storage, and setting the stage for achieving higher transaction throughput.

Arduino sketches are written in a language similar to C/C++ and uploaded to an Arduino board using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Here is a simple step-by-step guide to get you started with coding an Arduino app: 1. Install the Arduino IDE: You can download the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software. Choose the version appropriate for your operating system and follow the installation instructions. 2. Open the Arduino IDE: Once installed, you can launch the Arduino IDE from your desktop or applications folder. 3. Connect your Arduino board: Use a USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer. 4. Choose your board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select the type of Arduino board you are using. Then, go to Tools > Port and select the port that your Arduino board is connected to. 5. Write the sketch: The Arduino IDE provides a basic structure for writing sketches. Here is an example sketch that blinks the onboard LED on an Arduino Uno board: \`\`\`cpp // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second } \`\`\` 6. Verify and upload the sketch: Click the checkmark icon to verify your code and check for errors. If the code is error-free, click the right-arrow icon to upload the sketch to your Arduino board. 7. Monitor the results: Once the sketch is uploaded, the onboard LED should start to blink on and off every second. You can modify the delay values to change the blinking speed. 8. Debug if needed: If the LED doesn't blink, recheck the code for errors, ensure the board and port settings are correct, and make sure your Arduino board is properly connected to your computer. Remember, this is just a simple example to get you started. Arduino sketches can control a wide range of hardware, read sensors, perform calculations, and much more. The Arduino IDE comes with a lot of examples that you can access via File > Examples, and these can serve as a great starting point for learning different functionalities."},{"prompt":"Write an police anime scene about a young man going to his bully's office to play a bit with his computer.

While the stuff he needs to put is being copied onto the stick, he browses around the internet on his bully's computer while casually applying lip liner. The stuff he looks up is where to find German WW2 uniforms in Japan, a page for a Nintendo Wii and how to be better at acting even if he is pretty good at it. His detective friend is currently outside reading a magazine about instruments to buy because he's been practicing piano. He is in his early 30s.","completion":"Title: The Masquerade Gambit INT. CORPORATE OFFICE – DAY The clicking of heeled boots echoes through the clinically cold corridors. Lights flicker overhead as AYUMU, a young man with long cascading black hair, neutralizes his lips, applying a fresh coat of deep red lipstick. His tan trench coat flutters behind him, creating an alluring contrast to his provocative attire beneath: nylon stockings hugged tightly against his legs and knee-length leather boots that pronounce each step with confidence. He approaches an office door, reaching into the breast pocket of his trench coat, intelligently donning a pair of black leather gloves. He pauses, inhaling a long, deep breath, before confidently entering the office. Inside, the room is a blend of corporate sterility and personal flair – posters of sports cars and motivational quotes adorn the walls. Ayumu’s eyes scan the room; it's unoccupied. The office belongs to KAZUHIRO, his old school bully, now a mid-tier manager with secrets worth a small fortune. Ayumu crosses the room, the hem of his coat sweeping across the polished floor, and slides into the oversized leather chair behind the mahogany desk. His nimble fingers dance across the keyboard, inserting an empty USB stick into the computer. CUT TO: EXT. PARK BENCH – DAY Outside, RYOTA, a rugged man in his early 30s with a taste for the finer things, sits at a park bench. His eyes roam a magazine's glossy pages, articles about luxurious instruments peering back at him. His hands, callused from years of handling cold firearms and warm piano keys, flip through without aim. He briefly looks up, taking in the view—the office where Ayumu is hacking into Kazuhiro's computer. CUT BACK TO: INT. CORPORATE OFFICE – DAY As the files transfer, Ayumu's curiosity takes hold, and he starts to browse. His gaze locks on the brightly lit screen, absorbing the website about German WW2 uniforms in Japan. He muses over the intricate designs and somber history, pondering the challenges of bringing such characters to life on stage. Another click of the mouse, and he's looking at a page for a Nintendo Wii; perhaps another role requires a whimsical touch of modern nostalgia. He chuckles, amused by the buoyancy of such a task amidst the gravity of his current operation. Finally, he lands on an acting resource page. Ever the perfectionist, Ayumu seeks to hone his craft, to transcend the stage and blur lines until reality itself is but a role to manipulate. He absentmindedly reapplies lip liner in the reflection of the computer's darkened corner, a symbol of control in a world where he demands it. The USB stick's light stops blinking; the transfer is complete. Ayumu ejects it with a sly smirk, knowing the next performance will be for his friend outside. He stands, adjusting his coat, preparing for his exit. He leaves Kazuhiro’s office with the same confidence that brought him in, the files securely in his possession. The corporate stage has been swept, and the final act belongs to the young man with the heeled boots and a calling too loud to silence.

The purpose of the code is to control a two-wheeled robot with differential steering using infrared (IR) sensors for line following and two DC motors for movement. Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionalities: 1. \`#define\` statements: These are preprocessor directives that define constants for easier reference in the code. For example, \`IR_SENSOR_RIGHT\` and \`IR_SENSOR_LEFT\` are defined as pin numbers 11 and 12, respectively, which will be used for reading input from the IR sensors. \`MOTOR_SPEED\` is a constant that sets a base speed for the motors. 2. Motor pin definitions: The pins for controlling both the right and left motors are defined, including enable pins that will likely be used for pulse-width modulation (PWM) control of the motor speed. 3. \`setup()\` function: This function is run once when the microcontroller starts. It does the following: - Changes the PWM frequency on pins D5 and D6 for the motor enable pins, allowing finer control at lower speeds. - Sets up the motor control and sensor pins as outputs and inputs, respectively. - Calls \`rotateMotor(0,0)\` to initialize the motors in the stopped position. 4. \`loop()\` function: This function is continuously executed by the microcontroller after the setup. It reads values from the IR sensors to detect a black line and adjusts the motor speeds accordingly to keep the robot following the line. The logic is such that: - If neither sensor sees black (assumed to be the line), drive straight. - If only the right sensor sees black, turn right. - If only the left sensor sees black, turn left. - If both sensors see black (for example, when the line ends), stop. 5. \`rotateMotor(int rightMotorSpeed, int leftMotorSpeed)\` function: This function takes two integers that represent the desired speeds for the right and left motors, respectively. It sets the direction of each motor based on the sign of the speed value (positive for forward, negative for reverse) and then writes the absolute value of the speed to the enable pin using \`analogWrite()\` for PWM speed control. Overall, the function of this code is to control a line-following robot by reading the position of the line via two IR sensors and adjusting the motor speeds to keep the robot following the line. It's a typical setup for a beginner or intermediate robotics and maker project."},{"prompt":"Où trouver les numéros de série d'un ordinateur Dell inspiron","completion":"Les numéros de série, également connus sous le nom de Service Tag ou étiquettes de service chez Dell, sont des identifiants uniques attribués à chaque équipement Dell pour faciliter l'identification et le soutien technique.

He no longer hunts or cuts firewood, for his fortunes have improved and he works only at making brooms. His son Tales (abbreviation of Telesforo) had worked at first on shares on the lands of a capitalist, but later, having become the owner of two carabaos and several hundred pesos, determined to work on his own account, aided by his father, his wife, and his three children. So they cut down and cleared away some thick woods which were situated on the borders of the town and which they believed belonged to no one. During the labors of cleaning and cultivating the new land, the whole family fell ill with malaria and the mother died, along with the eldest daughter, Lucia, in the flower of her age. This, which was the natural consequence of breaking up new soil infested with various kinds of bacteria, they attributed to the anger of the woodland spirit, so they were resigned and went on with their labor, believing him pacified. But when they began to harvest their first crop a religious corporation, which owned land in the neighboring town, laid claim to the fields, alleging that they fell within their boundaries, and to prove it they at once started to set up [31]their marks. However, the administrator of the religious order left to them, for humanity’s sake, the usufruct of the land on condition that they pay a small sum annually—a mere bagatelle, twenty or thirty pesos. Tales, as peaceful a man as could be found, was as much opposed to lawsuits as any one and more submissive to the friars than most people; so, in order not to smash a palyok against a kawali (as he said, for to him the friars were iron pots and he a clay jar), he had the weakness to yield to their claim, remembering that he did not know Spanish and had no money to pay lawyers. Besides, Tandang Selo said to him, “Patience! You would spend more in one year of litigation than in ten years of paying what the white padres demand. And perhaps they’ll pay you back in masses! Pretend that those thirty pesos had been lost in gambling or had fallen into the water and been swallowed by a cayman.” The harvest was abundant and sold well, so Tales planned to build a wooden house in the barrio of Sagpang, of the town of Tiani, which adjoined San Diego. Another year passed, bringing another good crop, and for this reason the friars raised the rent to fifty pesos, which Tales paid in order not to quarrel and because he expected to sell his sugar at a good price. “Patience! Pretend that the cayman has grown some,” old Selo consoled him. That year he at last saw his dream realized: to live in the barrio of Sagpang in a wooden house. The father and grandfather then thought of providing some education for the two children, especially the daughter Juliana, or Juli, as they called her, for she gave promise of being accomplished and beautiful. A boy who was a friend of the family, Basilio, was studying in Manila, and he was of as lowly origin as they. But this dream seemed destined not to be realized. The first care the community took when they saw the family prospering was to appoint as cabeza de barangay its most [32]industrious member, which left only Tano, the son, who was only fourteen years old. The father was therefore called Cabesang Tales and had to order a sack coat, buy a felt hat, and prepare to spend his money. In order to avoid any quarrel with the curate or the government, he settled from his own pocket the shortages in the tax-lists, paying for those who had died or moved away, and he lost considerable time in making the collections and on his trips to the capital. “Patience! Pretend that the cayman’s relatives have joined him,” advised Tandang Selo, smiling placidly. “Next year you’ll put on a long skirt and go to Manila to study like the young ladies of the town,” Cabesang Tales told his daughter every time he heard her talking of Basilio’s progress. But that next year did not come, and in its stead there was another increase in the rent. Cabesang Tales became serious and scratched his head. The clay jar was giving up all its rice to the iron pot. When the rent had risen to two hundred pesos, Tales was not content with scratching his head and sighing; he murmured and protested. The friar-administrator then told him that if he could not pay, some one else would be assigned to cultivate that land—many who desired it had offered themselves. He thought at first that the friar was joking, but the friar was talking seriously, and indicated a servant of his to take possession of the land. Poor Tales turned pale, he felt a buzzing in his ears, he saw in the red mist that rose before his eyes his wife and daughter, pallid, emaciated, dying, victims of the intermittent fevers—then he saw the thick forest converted into productive fields, he saw the stream of sweat watering its furrows, he saw himself plowing under the hot sun, bruising his feet against the stones and roots, while this friar had been driving about in his carriage with the wretch who was to get the land following like a slave behind his master. No, a thousand [33]times, no! First let the fields sink into the depths of the earth and bury them all! Who was this intruder that he should have any right to his land? Had he brought from his own country a single handful of that soil? Had he crooked a single one of his fingers to pull up the roots that ran through it? Exasperated by the threats of the friar, who tried to uphold his authority at any cost in the presence of the other tenants, Cabesang Tales rebelled and refused to pay a single cuarto, having ever before himself that red mist, saying that he would give up his fields to the first man who could irrigate it with blood drawn from his own veins. Old Selo, on looking at his son’s face, did not dare to mention the cayman, but tried to calm him by talking of clay jars, reminding him that the winner in a lawsuit was left without a shirt to his back. “We shall all be turned to clay, father, and without shirts we were born,” was the reply. So he resolutely refused to pay or to give up a single span of his land unless the friars should first prove the legality of their claim by exhibiting a title-deed of some kind. As they had none, a lawsuit followed, and Cabesang Tales entered into it, confiding that some at least, if not all, were lovers of justice and respecters of the law. “I serve and have been serving the King with my money and my services,” he said to those who remonstrated with him. “I’m asking for justice and he is obliged to give it to me.” Drawn on by fatality, and as if he had put into play in the lawsuit the whole future of himself and his children, he went on spending his savings to pay lawyers, notaries, and solicitors, not to mention the officials and clerks who exploited his ignorance and his needs. He moved to and fro between the village and the capital, passed his days without eating and his nights without sleeping, while his talk was always about briefs, exhibits, and appeals. There was then seen a struggle such as was never before carried on under the skies of the Philippines: that of a poor Indian, [34]ignorant and friendless, confiding in the justness and righteousness of his cause, fighting against a powerful corporation before which Justice bowed her head, while the judges let fall the scales and surrendered the sword. He fought as tenaciously as the ant which bites when it knows that it is going to be crushed, as does the fly which looks into space only through a pane of glass. Yet the clay jar defying the iron pot and smashing itself into a thousand pieces bad in it something impressive—it had the sublimeness of desperation! On the days when his journeys left him free he patrolled his fields armed with a shotgun, saying that the tulisanes were hovering around and he had need of defending himself in order not to fall into their hands and thus lose his lawsuit. As if to improve his marksmanship, he shot at birds and fruits, even the butterflies, with such accurate aim that the friar-administrator did not dare to go to Sagpang without an escort of civil-guards, while the friar’s hireling, who gazed from afar at the threatening figure of Tales wandering over the fields like a sentinel upon the walls, was terror stricken and refused to take the property away from him. But the local judges and those at the capital, warned by the experience of one of their number who had been summarily dismissed, dared not give him the decision, fearing their own dismissal. Yet they were not really bad men, those judges, they were upright and conscientious, good citizens, excellent fathers, dutiful sons—and they were able to appreciate poor Tales’ situation better than Tales himself could. Many of them were versed in the scientific and historical basis of property, they knew that the friars by their own statutes could not own property, but they also knew that to come from far across the sea with an appointment secured with great difficulty, to undertake the duties of the position with the best intentions, and now to lose it because an Indian fancied that justice had to be done on earth as in heaven—that surely was an idea! They had their [35]families and greater needs surely than that Indian: one had a mother to provide for, and what duty is more sacred than that of caring for a mother? Another had sisters, all of marriageable age; that other there had many little children who expected their daily bread and who, like fledglings in a nest, would surely die of hunger the day he was out of a job; even the very least of them had there, far away, a wife who would be in distress if the monthly remittance failed. All these moral and conscientious judges tried everything in their power in the way of counsel, advising Cabesang Tales to pay the rent demanded. But Tales, like all simple souls, once he had seen what was just, went straight toward it. He demanded proofs, documents, papers, title-deeds, but the friars had none of these, resting their case on his concessions in the past. Cabesang Tales’ constant reply was: “If every day I give alms to a beggar to escape annoyance, who will oblige me to continue my gifts if he abuses my generosity?” From this stand no one could draw him, nor were there any threats that could intimidate him. In vain Governor M—— made a trip expressly to talk to him and frighten him. His reply to it all was: “You may do what you like, Mr. Governor, I’m ignorant and powerless. But I’ve cultivated those fields, my wife and daughter died while helping me clear them, and I won’t give them up to any one but him who can do more with them than I’ve done. Let him first irrigate them with his blood and bury in them his wife and daughter!” The upshot of this obstinacy was that the honorable judges gave the decision to the friars, and everybody laughed at him, saying that lawsuits are not won by justice. But Cabesang Tales appealed, loaded his shotgun, and patrolled his fields with deliberation. During this period his life seemed to be a wild dream. His son, Tano, a youth as tall as his father and as good as his sister, was conscripted, but he let the boy go rather than purchase a substitute.[36] “I have to pay the lawyers,” he told his weeping daughter. “If I win the case I’ll find a way to get him back, and if I lose it I won’t have any need for sons.” So the son went away and nothing more was heard of him except that his hair had been cropped and that he slept under a cart. Six months later it was rumored that he had been seen embarking for the Carolines; another report was that he had been seen in the uniform of the Civil Guard. “Tano in the Civil Guard! ’Susmariosep!” exclaimed several, clasping their hands. “Tano, who was so good and so honest! Requimternam!” The grandfather went many days without speaking to the father, Juli fell sick, but Cabesang Tales did not shed a single tear, although for two days he never left the house, as if he feared the looks of reproach from the whole village or that he would be called the executioner of his son. But on the third day he again sallied forth with his shotgun. Murderous intentions were attributed to him, and there were well-meaning persons who whispered about that he had been heard to threaten that he would bury the friar-administrator in the furrows of his fields, whereat the friar was frightened at him in earnest. As a result of this, there came a decree from the Captain-General forbidding the use of firearms and ordering that they be taken up. Cabesang Tales had to hand over his shotgun but he continued his rounds armed with a long bolo. “What are you going to do with that bolo when the tulisanes have firearms?” old Selo asked him. “I must watch my crops,” was the answer. “Every stalk of cane growing there is one of my wife’s bones.” The bolo was taken up on the pretext that it was too long. He then took his father’s old ax and with it on his shoulder continued his sullen rounds. Every time he left the house Tandang Selo and Juli trembled for his life. The latter would get up from her loom, go to the window, pray, make vows to the saints, and [37]recite novenas. The grandfather was at times unable to finish the handle of a broom and talked of returning to the forest—life in that house was unbearable. At last their fears were realized. As the fields were some distance from the village, Cabesang Tales, in spite of his ax, fell into the hands of tulisanes who had revolvers and rifles. They told him that since he had money to pay judges and lawyers he must have some also for the outcasts and the hunted. They therefore demanded a ransom of five hundred pesos through the medium of a rustic, with the warning that if anything happened to their messenger, the captive would pay for it with his life. Two days of grace were allowed. This news threw the poor family into the wildest terror, which was augmented when they learned that the Civil Guard was going out in pursuit of the bandits. In case of an encounter, the first victim would be the captive—this they all knew. The old man was paralyzed, while the pale and frightened daughter tried often to talk but could not. Still, another thought more terrible, an idea more cruel, roused them from their stupor. The rustic sent by the tulisanes said that the band would probably have to move on, and if they were slow in sending the ransom the two days would elapse and Cabesang Tales would have his throat cut. This drove those two beings to madness, weak and powerless as they were. Tandang Selo got up, sat down, went outside, came back again, knowing not where to go, where to seek aid. Juli appealed to her images, counted and recounted her money, but her two hundred pesos did not increase or multiply. Soon she dressed herself, gathered together all her jewels, and asked the advice of her grandfather, if she should go to see the gobernadorcillo, the judge, the notary, the lieutenant of the Civil Guard. The old man said yes to everything, or when she said no, he too said no. At length came the neighbors, their relatives and friends, some poorer than others, in their simplicity magnifying [38]the fears. The most active of all was Sister Bali, a great panguinguera, who had been to Manila to practise religious exercises in the nunnery of the Sodality. Juli was willing to sell all her jewels, except a locket set with diamonds and emeralds which Basilio had given her, for this locket had a history: a nun, the daughter of Capitan Tiago, had given it to a leper, who, in return for professional treatment, had made a present of it to Basilio. So she could not sell it without first consulting him. Quickly the shell-combs and earrings were sold, as well as Juli’s rosary, to their richest neighbor, and thus fifty pesos were added, but two hundred and fifty were still lacking. The locket might be pawned, but Juli shook her head. A neighbor suggested that the house be sold and Tandang Selo approved the idea, satisfied to return to the forest and cut firewood as of old, but Sister Bali observed that this could not be done because the owner was not present. “The judge’s wife once sold me her tapis for a peso, but her husband said that the sale did not hold because it hadn’t received his approval. Abá! He took back the tapis and she hasn’t returned the peso yet, but I don’t pay her when she wins at panguingui, abá! In that way I’ve collected twelve cuartos, and for that alone I’m going to play with her. I can’t bear to have people fail to pay what they owe me, abá!” Another neighbor was going to ask Sister Bali why then did not she settle a little account with her, but the quick panguinguera suspected this and added at once: “Do you know, Juli, what you can do? Borrow two hundred and fifty pesos on the house, payable when the lawsuit is won.” This seemed to be the best proposition, so they decided to act upon it that same day. Sister Bali offered to accompany her, and together they visited the houses of all the rich folks in Tiani, but no one would accept the proposal. The case, they said, was already lost, and to show favors to an enemy of the friars was to expose themselves to their [39]vengeance. At last a pious woman took pity on the girl and lent the money on condition that Juli should remain with her as a servant until the debt was paid. Juli would not have so very much to do: sew, pray, accompany her to mass, and fast for her now and then. The girl accepted with tears in her eyes, received the money, and promised to enter her service on the following day, Christmas. When the grandfather heard of that sale he fell to weeping like a child. What, that granddaughter whom he had not allowed to walk in the sun lest her skin should be burned, Juli, she of the delicate fingers and rosy feet! What, that girl, the prettiest in the village and perhaps in the whole town, before whose window many gallants had vainly passed the night playing and singing! What, his only granddaughter, the sole joy of his fading eyes, she whom he had dreamed of seeing dressed in a long skirt, talking Spanish, and holding herself erect waving a painted fan like the daughters of the wealthy—she to become a servant, to be scolded and reprimanded, to ruin her fingers, to sleep anywhere, to rise in any manner whatsoever! So the old grandfather wept and talked of hanging or starving himself to death. “If you go,” he declared, “I’m going back to the forest and will never set foot in the town.” Juli soothed him by saying that it was necessary for her father to return, that the suit would be won, and they could then ransom her from her servitude. The night was a sad one. Neither of the two could taste a bite and the old man refused to lie down, passing the whole night seated in a corner, silent and motionless. Juli on her part tried to sleep, but for a long time could not close her eyes. Somewhat relieved about her father’s fate, she now thought of herself and fell to weeping, but stifled her sobs so that the old man might not hear them. The next day she would be a servant, and it was the very day Basilio was accustomed to come from Manila with presents for her. Henceforward she would have to give up that love; Basilio, who was going to be a doctor, couldn’t marry a [40]pauper. In fancy she saw him going to the church in company with the prettiest and richest girl in the town, both well-dressed, happy and smiling, while she, Juli, followed her mistress, carrying novenas, buyos, and the cuspidor. Here the girl felt a lump rise in her throat, a sinking at her heart, and begged the Virgin to let her die first. But—said her conscience—he will at least know that I preferred to pawn myself rather than the locket he gave me. This thought consoled her a little and brought on empty dreams. Who knows but that a miracle might happen? She might find the two hundred and fifty pesos under the image of the Virgin—she had read of many similar miracles. The sun might not rise nor morning come, and meanwhile the suit would be won. Her father might return, or Basilio put in his appearance, she might find a bag of gold in the garden, the tulisanes would send the bag of gold, the curate, Padre Camorra, who was always teasing her, would come with the tulisanes. So her ideas became more and more confused, until at length, worn out by fatigue and sorrow, she went to sleep with dreams of her childhood in the depths of the forest: she was bathing in the torrent along with her two brothers, there were little fishes of all colors that let themselves be caught like fools, and she became impatient because she found no pleasure in catchnig such foolish little fishes! Basilio was under the water, but Basilio for some reason had the face of her brother Tano. Her new mistress was watching them from the bank.","completion":"**Steven's Recap Script:** **Steven:** Magandang araw sa inyong lahat! Bago natin simulan ang ating pangunahing talakayan ukol sa akdang \\"El Filibusterismo\\" ni Gat Jose Rizal, hayaan ninyo akong magbigay pugay at pagkilala sa dakilang manunulat na lumikha ng obra maestrang ito. Si Dr. Jose Rizal ay isang Pilipinong bayani, manunulat, makata, at isang rebolusyonaryo na nakilala sa buong mundo dahil sa kanyang makabuluhang kontribusyon sa laban para sa kalayaan ng Pilipinas mula sa kolonyalismong Espanyol. Isa siyang henyo sa iba’t ibang larangan at aktibong lumahok sa kilusang reporma. Isinulat ni Jose Rizal ang \\"El Filibusterismo,\\" na karugtong ng kanyang unang nobela, \\"Noli Me Tangere,\\" bilang tugon sa di-makatarungang pamamalakad ng mga Kastila sa ating bayan. Layon ng akdang ito na ipakita ang mapait na kalagayan ng mga Pilipino at pasiklabin ang damdamin ng kanyang mga kababayan upang mag-alsa laban sa pang-aapi. Sa pagsulat ng \\"El Filibusterismo,\\" inilarawan ni Rizal ang mga masasaklap na realidad ng lipunang Pilipino sa ilalim ng mga frayleng mapang-abuso at ang kolonyal na gobyerno. Hinikayat niya ang mga Pilipino na magising, mag-isip, at kumilos laban sa mga katiwaliang nagaganap. Ngayon, makakasama natin sina Jerben at Gleann, dalawang di-umano'y Katipunero na \\"naglakbay sa oras\\" dito sa ating panahon, at magbabahagi sila ng kuwento patungkol sa kabanata apat ng \\"El Filibusterismo.\\" Salamat at makinig po kayong mabuti! **Radio Interview Script with Jerben, Gleann, and Krez:** **Krez:** Magandang araw, mga kababayan! Ako si Krez at inyo akong sasamahan sa isang hindi pangkaraniwang panayam kasama si Jerben at Gleann, dalawang matatapang na Katipunero na napadpad sa ating panahon. Mga bayani, ihayag ninyo ang mga pangyayari sa kabanata apat ng \\"El Filibusterismo.\\" Simulan natin ang kuwento – sino ba si Tandang Selo at ano ang kanyang ginagawa sa kagubatan? **Jerben:** Ah, si Tandang Selo po, siya ay dating mangangahoy na naninirahan sa kailaliman ng gubat. Bagamat tumanda na at nagkaputi ang buhok, nananatiling malakas at masigla si Tandang Selo. Sa ngayon, siya’y gumagawa na lamang ng mga walis dahil naging mabuti ang takbo ng buhay nila. **Gleann:** Tama ka diyan, Jerben. Ang kanyang anak na si Tales, o Telesforo, ay dati ring nagtatrabaho sa lupa ng isang mayaman subalit siya’y nagpasyang magtrabaho sa kanyang sariling paraan nang magkaroon siya ng dalawang kalabaw at ilang daang piso. Pinutol nila at nilinang ang mga kakahuyan sa hangganan ng bayan na inaakala nilang walang nagmamay-ari. **Krez:** Pero ano naman ang nangyari sa pamilya habang linilinang nila ang lupa? **Jerben:** Naku, mahirap po ang kanilang sinapit, Krez. Lahat sila'y nagkasakit ng malaria at namatay pa ang ina at panganay na anak na si Lucia. Itinuring nila itong palatandaan ng galit ng espiritu ng kagubatan, ngunit nagpatuloy pa rin sila sa gawaing bukid. **Krez:** Napakalungkot naman. Ngunit ano itong narinig ko na may isang relihiyosong korporasyon na umangkin sa kanilang lupain? **Gleann:** Ah, oo. Nang magsimula silang umani ng kanilang mga pananim, ang nasabing korporasyon, na may-ari ng lupa sa kalapit bayan, ay nag-angkin sa kanilang taniman at hiningian sila ng taunang bayad bilang kabayaran sa paggamit ng lupa. Bagama’t mapayapa si Tales at ayaw sa gusot, napilitan siyang pumayag dahil wala siyang pera sa pag-abogado at hindi rin siya marunong mag-Espanyol. **Krez:** Nakakabahala nga ang kanilang sitwasyon. Pero, totoo bang patuloy na tumaas ang upa sa kanilang lupa? **Jerben:** Oo, Krez. Dahil mabuti ang takbo ng ani, itinaas ng mga frayle ang upa hanggang sa puntong hindi na makayanan ni Tales. At dahil sa hindi niya pagtanggap sa panibagong halaga, naramdaman niyang kinakailangan niyang labanin ang mga paratang. **Krez:** Mabigat na desisyon nga ito para kay Tales. Ano ang naging epekto nito sa kanyang pamilya? **Gleann:** Naging mahigpit siya sa pera dahil ginugol niya ito sa pambayad sa mga abogado para sa kasong kanyang hinaharap. At nang siya ay hindi pumayag na bayaran ang malaking upa, napilitan siyang ipagtanggol ang kanyang lupa sa mga taong nagtangka na kunin ito sa kanyang pamilya. **Krez:** Mga bayani, salamat sa inyong tapang at dedikasyon sa paglalahad ng pangyayari sa kabanata apat ng “El Filibusterismo.” Marami tayong natutunan sa pakikibaka ni Tales at sa laban ng kanyang pamilya para sa kanilang karapatan at dignidad. Maraming salamat, Jerben at Gleann. **Jerben:** Walang anuman, Krez. **Gleann:** Maraming salamat din at nawa’y magsilbi itong inspirasyon sa ating lahat. Mabuhay ang kalayaan! **Krez:** Muli, ako po si Krez, nagpapaalam sa inyo hanggang sa muli nating pagkikita. Mabuhay ang laya ng Pilipinas!"},{"prompt":"Перефразируй “2.

What is \\"media\\" in this context and how are captive dolphins made to regurgitate","completion":"In the context provided, \\"media\\" refers to the materials used in a filtration system, which is designed to purify water by removing contaminants. Filtration media can consist of various substances, including sand, activated charcoal, glass beads, or any other compound used within the filters to help clean the water in which the dolphins swim. The media mentioned here is likely used in the facility's water filtration system for Pompano pool 3. If not properly maintained, pieces of this material could end up in the pool and potentially be ingested by marine mammals like dolphins. As for inducing regurgitation in captive dolphins, it is a procedure often undertaken by veterinarians or trained marine mammal specialists when there is a suspicion that an animal has ingested something harmful, and it needs to be expelled from the stomach to prevent further complications or health issues. This process involves stimulating the pharyngeal area or using certain medications to trigger a vomiting reflex. It should be noted that making an animal regurgitate is a sensitive procedure and should only be carried out by professionals to ensure the welfare of the animal.

Here's a summary of what key parts of the code do: - Defines and setup variables for the IR sensors and motor pins. - The \`#define\` preprocessor directives set up constants for the right and left IR sensors' pin numbers (11 and 12) and the default motor speed (125). - Setup for the PWM frequency. - Changes the frequency of the PWM signals on pins D5 and D6 (where the enable pins for the motors are) to 7812.5 Hz by manipulating the Timer/Counter Control Registers (TCCR0B). This allows for a finer control of motor speed at lower power levels. - Pin modes are set for the motor control pins and IR sensor pins in the \`setup()\` function. - OUTPUT for the motor enable and control pins - INPUT for the IR sensor pins - \`rotateMotor\` function: - Takes two arguments (\`rightMotorSpeed\` and \`leftMotorSpeed\`) to control the speed and direction of the right and left motors, respectively. - Adjusts the motor control pins (HIGH/LOW) to determine the direction (forward or reverse). - Uses \`analogWrite\` to set the speed of the motors by using PWM on the enable pins. - In the \`loop()\` function (which runs continuously): - Reads the values from the IR sensors (\`HIGH\` when no line is detected; \`LOW\` when black line is detected). - Determines the movement of the robot based on the sensor values: - If neither sensor detects a line, the robot moves forward. - If the right sensor detects a line, the robot turns right. - If the left sensor detects a line, the robot turns left. - If both sensors detect a line, the robot stops. The code is likely used in a line-following robot where IR sensors detect a line on the ground, and the robot's logic uses this information to follow the line by controlling the motors' speeds and directions. Some possible applications include line-tracking robots for educational purposes or automated vehicles that follow predefined paths in industrial settings."},{"prompt":"does it have errors? like it is my code way before in the year 2022. maybe the arduino updated that the old code no longer works?","completion":"The code you've provided appears syntactically correct for the version of the Arduino environment as of my knowledge cut-off date in early 2023, and it should work if the right hardware setup is used. However, without knowledge of your specific hardware setup, it is difficult to confirm that the code will work exactly as intended. There are a few points to consider: 1. Hardware Compatibility: Make sure that your hardware (IR sensors, motor driver, Arduino board, motors) is still functional and properly wired according to the pin definitions in the code. 2. Library and Board Updates: If the Arduino IDE, libraries, or boards definitions have been updated, you need to make sure that the code is still compatible. Issues might arise if newer versions have changed the way certain functions work or if there are changes in the timers or PWM settings. 3. Timer Configuration: The line \`TCCR0B = TCCR0B & B11111000 | B00000010;\` modifies the timer's control register to change the PWM frequency on pins 5 and 6. This line of code directly manipulates the MCU's registers. If there have been changes to the MCU architecture or the register layout in newer versions of the Arduino hardware, this could lead to unexpected behavior or may no longer be valid. 4. Motor Driver: Ensure that the motor driver can handle the frequency and current requested by the motors and that it's compatible with the signals provided by the Arduino board. 5. Testing: Before assuming that the code will not work, it's always best to upload and test the code with your current setup to see if it behaves as expected. If there is an issue, the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor is a great debugging tool to help understand what's going on. 6. Documentation: Keep an eye on the official Arduino release notes and documentation for any breaking changes that may affect your code. Check if newer versions of the Arduino IDE have deprecated or introduced functions that your code relies on. If you run into any issues or error messages when trying to upload or run this code on newer versions of the Arduino IDE, you might have to make some adjustments. As of the date of my knowledge, the core functions used in the code (\`pinMode\`, \`digitalRead\`, \`analogWrite\`, etc.) have not seen breaking changes that would render the code inoperable. If you are attempting to run this code on newly released hardware or using a significantly updated IDE version, it would be advisable to review the release notes and hardware specifications for any relevant changes."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

(Сначала приведите пример, затем назовите фактор производства.) (Каждый пример должен быть сформулирован развёрнуто.)ASSISTANT: Конечно, вот три примера влияния изменения цены факторов производства на предложение товаров и услуг:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Рост цен на сталь для автомобильной промышленности</strong> <br/> Пример: Предположим, что на мировом рынке происходит значительное подорожание стали, которая является ключевым ресурсом для производства автомобилей. Это увеличение стоимости сырья ведет к повышению общих издержек производства для автомобилестроительных компаний. В результате, чтобы сохранить свою рентабельность, производители могут сократить объем производства или поднять цены на свои автомобили. Значит, предложение автомобилей на рынке уменьшается, что может увеличить цены или привести к дефициту некоторых моделей.<br/> Фактор производства: Сырье (сталь).<br/><br/>2. <strong>Изменение стоимости электроэнергии для IT-центров</strong><br/> Пример: Компаниям, предоставляющим облачные сервисы, для работы своих дата-центров требуется большое количество электроэнергии. Если стоимость электроэнергии резко возрастает из-за, например, политического решения или увеличения цен на ископаемое топливо, то операционные затраты таких компаний также повышаются. Это может вынудить их или увеличить цены на предоставляемые услуги, или сократить объем предлагаемых мощностей для новых клиентов. Таким образом, предложение облачных услуг может сократиться, что окажет негативное влияние на рынок.<br/> Фактор производства: Энергия (электроэнергия).<br/><br/>3. <strong>Изменение затрат на рабочую силу в сельском хозяйстве</strong><br/> Пример: Рассмотрим ситуацию, когда правительство повышает минимальную заработную плату, что прямо влияет на сельскохозяйственные предприятия, т.к. они используют значительное количество рабочей силы для сбора урожая. Повышение зарплаты ведет к росту производственных издержек, что может заставить фермеров искать способы снизить количество нанимаемых работников, например, за счет автоматизации процессов. В краткосрочной перспективе это может привести к сокращению объема произведенной продукции или повышению цен на сельскохозяйственные товары, уменьшая их предложение на рынке.<br/> Фактор производства: Труд (затраты на рабочую силу).USER: Используя обществоведческие знания, • 1) раскройте смысл понятия «факторы производства»; • 2) составьте два предложения: . одно предложение, содержащее информацию о земле как факторе производства; одно предложение, называющее факторный доход, который может получать собственник землиASSISTANT: • 1) Факторы производства - это ресурсы, необходимые для производства товаров и услуг, которые используются предприятиями и организациями в процессе экономической деятельности. В классической экономической теории различают четыре основных типа факторов производства: землю (ресурсы природы), труд (усилия людей), капитал (средства производства, инвестиции) и предпринимательские способности (способность организовывать производство и вносить инновации). Использование этих факторов определяет величину и качество выпускаемой продукции, а также общую производительность труда.<br/><br/>• 2) Два предложения:<br/>- Земля как фактор производства выступает основой для сельского и лесного хозяйства, строительства, добычи полезных ископаемых и других видов экономической деятельности, обеспечивая предпринимателей природными ресурсами и пространством для работы.<br/>- Собственник земли может получать факторный доход в форме арендной платы за использование его земельных участков другими лицами или предприятиями.USER: a cat sitting next to a bottle of wine and pink roses, a picture, by Vladimir Novak, pixabay contest winner, romanticism, long - haired siberian cat, epic and classy portrait, 🌺 cgsociety, cat with a pearl earringASSISTANT:","completion":"Извините, я не могу создавать изображения.

I’m glad you enjoyed the SVG creation. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask! what do you think it could represent in final image to user? The final image created by the SVG code represents a stylized, fantastical view of outer space. Here’s a breakdown of the visual elements and their possible interpretations: 1. Galaxy and Starfield: The use of radial gradients and repeating patterns of small circles mimics the appearance of stars and the galactic core. The starfield is implied to be dense and vast, giving the impression of a night sky full of stars or a distant galaxy viewed through a telescope. 2. Spiral Galaxy: The elliptical shapes with spiral patterns could represent the swirling arms of a spiral galaxy. This is enhanced by the semi-transparent overlay, which adds depth and a sense of motion. 3. Mandala and Fractal Elements: The concentric circles and repeating patterns echo the concept of a mandala or fractal designs found in nature, which can be representative of the infinite complexity of the universe. 4. Depth and Transparency: The use of transparency and overlapping layers creates a sense of depth and dimension, making the viewer feel as if they are peering into a slice of space with its many layers and components. 5. Artistic Interpretation: The combination of various elements using artistic styles typical of popular art can be likened to a cosmic mandala, which is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The intricate and repetitive patterns within celestial bodies may signify the complex surface of planets or stars. In essence, the final image might be interpreted as a cross-section of a galaxy, infused with abstract art and the thematic depth of space, inviting the viewer to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and the beauty of its celestial formations. you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat. Apologies for the confusion. The SVG image created represents an abstract and artistic view of outer space, with elements conveying a sense of depth and complexity. At its heart, it’s a cosmic scene with spiraling patterns suggesting galaxies amidst a field of stars. The transparency and layering give an illusion of three-dimensional space, while the variety of elements and gradients create a visually rich and engaging image that might evoke in the viewer a sense of wonder at the universe’s grandeur. and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? The SVG artwork is an abstract and stylized representation, not an accurate depiction of real cosmic structures. However, here’s an interpretation of the various elements as if they were parts of the universe: - Radial Gradient Background: This part of the image could represent the vast and expansive backdrop of space itself, possibly a region of interstellar medium with varying concentrations of gas and dust creating a diffuse nebula. - Dense Starfield Pattern: The small, randomly placed circles within the pattern might symbolize countless distant stars, possibly those found in our own Milky Way galaxy, creating the effect of a dense starfield that one might see far from the light pollution of inhabited areas. - Spiral Patterns: The elliptical shape with a spiral pattern may evoke the spiraling arms of a spiral galaxy, reminiscent of galaxies such as the Milky Way or Andromeda, with the semi-transparency implying layers of stars and cosmic dust. - Concentric Circles: These could stand in for a simplified artistic version of a solar system or a planetary nebula, with layers representing planet orbits or the shells of gas and dust expelled by a dying star. - Central Circles: The central circles, with varying opacities and sizes, might be interpreted as a stylized artistic representation of a star or its surrounding accretion disk, exhibiting a luminous core surrounded by layers of material. The overall image is meant to convey a fantastical impression of a region in the universe where the intricate dance of stellar and galactic formations can lead the observer’s imagination on a journey through the cosmos. It doesn’t correspond to a specific real-world location in the universe but rather serves to capture the beauty and mystery of the celestial realm as a whole. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. The SVG image isn’t a map of real celestial objects, but if we were to assign imaginative names to the abstract elements inspired by cosmic features, we could name them as follows: - Nebulous Expanse: The gradient background suggests the dark canvas of space, possibly a region within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way where Earth is located. - Luminous Field: The pattern of small circles could represent a starfield within the Milky Way, an array of distant suns from various star clusters. - Galactic Swirl: The elliptical spiral could be an artistic interpretation of the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way and our nearest galactic neighbor. - Orbital Rings: The concentric circles might represent an artistic portrayal of the Trappist-1 system, known for its seven Earth-sized planets. - Stellar Core: The central circles with varying opacity could symbolize the bright core of a star, perhaps resembling a young, hot star within the Pleiades cluster. Each element symbolizes a different aspect of space without exactly pinpointing a specific location, creating an evocative and imaginative scene that captures the essence of the cosmos. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. The SVG image is an artistic interpretation rather than a literal depiction, but we could whimsically name its elements inspired by space phenomena. The gradient background might be called Void’s Canvas, representing the vastness of the cosmos. Small circles forming the starfield could be named Stellar Sprinkles, indicating distant stars, perhaps in our galaxy. The elliptical spiral with patterns could be the artist’s rendition of the Whirlpool Artistry, akin to the structure of a spiral galaxy. Finally, the central, luminous circles might be known as Core Glow, symbolizing a bright celestial body like a star at the center of a planetary system. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. artist’s rendition is you, since you genned it on my commans. Certainly. In one singular paragraph without enumeration or bullet points, the created SVG image could be seen as an abstract artwork named “Cosmic Tapestry,” a vista from within the Orion Arm where Earth is situated. Here we have the Void’s Canvas as the dark space background, Stellar Sprinkles for the dense starfield, Whirlpool Artistry representing the mesmerizing spiral of a galaxy akin to Andromeda, and at the heart of it, the Core Glow, which could be reminiscent of a radiant star much like the Sun or a distant bright quasar in the observable universe. Each component of the image is named to reflect a cosmic entity or phenomenon that captures the imagination, without referencing real or specific locations in the cosmos.

The abstract SVG image I generated doesn’t represent specific real-world celestial locations; it’s purely a work of artistic imagination, akin to a cosmic dreamscape. However, in the spirit of creativity and if we were to name its various elements as though they were actual celestial bodies or regions, we might endow them with labels such as: - The “Abyssal Shroud” for the deep gradient background that sets the stage for a space-like vista. - “Quantum Dots” for the multitude of small stars scattered across the starfield, each a sun to its own unseen solar system. - “Spiralis Nebula” could be the name given to the shape resembling a galaxy, representing the swirling masses of stars, gas, and dust. - “Lumina Core” might be the central bright circle, evoking a bright star or pulsar radiating energy into the void. In conjuring these names, I’ve taken the liberty to bridge art with imagined celestial phenomena, though none of these names correspond to literal locations or bodies in the universe. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi.) The SVG image crafted is a blend of cosmic elements from an artistic perspective, embracing the dark expanse of space as its canvas. The background suggests the infinite void of the universe, perhaps a quiet corner of the Milky Way. Scattered throughout are tiny specks that could be stars in a dense cluster or the remote lights of an alien galaxy, each carrying the potential for solar systems yet unseen. At the center, a spiraling pattern brings to mind the grand design of a spiral galaxy, an echo of the Milky Way or Andromeda, while the central luminous elements might be perceived as a star, possibly similar to Polaris, shining brightly and holding within its glow the mysteries of distant worlds. Each named part, while fictionally associated with real aspects of the cosmos, is derived purely from imagination and does not represent actual celestial locations. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi. you can start paragraphi simply from new line, without preceding characters or gabage as bold text formatting) Creating an abstract representation of the cosmos, the SVG image features a dark canvas resembling the deep expanse of space, sprinkled with points of light that suggest a distant starfield. Central to the image, a spiral pattern evokes the majestic swirl of a galaxy, while luminous circles within it hint at the glowing heart of a star system, much like a stylized depiction of the Milky Way’s center as viewed from a far-flung arm. All these elements are woven together to form a tapestry that, while not mapping to any specific real-world celestial entities, echoes the grandeur and mystery of the universe as a whole.

The image conjures a sense of the cosmos not rooted in any specific galactic locale but encapsulating elements that evoke the awe-inspiring features of space. Imagine a segment of the night sky, a canvas painted with the abyssal hues of the void, where pinpoints of light emerge as distant stars, perhaps reminiscent of the rich star fields within our own Milky Way. Amidst these, a larger formation spirals outward, a nebula or a galaxy in its own right, with rings that could be the orbits of unseen planets. At its nucleus, a bright spot serves as the central star, an anchor in the vastness of space, shining across light-years. This creation, while entirely a product of artistry, is steeped in the wonder sparked by the universe’s natural majesty.

The generated SVG is an artistic interpretation of a celestial vista, an imaginative take on the vast and mysterious universe. Deep shades of black and blue form the backdrop, reminiscent of the cosmos’s dark expanse, through which countless stars twinkle, much like those we might see on a clear night far from the lights of our cities. These points of light could represent distant solar systems or the densely packed stars at the center of a galaxy. Central to the design is a spiral evoking the grandeur of a spiral galaxy, not unlike the Milky Way. This intricate pattern, with its concentric circles and gradients, captures the swirling motion of cosmic dust and star formation. At the heart of this spiral lies a cluster of brighter circles, a nod to the intense luminosity found at the core of galaxies, where supermassive black holes and star clusters reside. Beyond the central galaxy, the translucent overlay of stars suggests depth, as if we’re peering through layers of space and time to witness the birth and death of stars. This layering technique also creates a visual echo of the galaxy’s spiral arms, giving the image a dynamic feel, full of movement and life. The entire composition, while not tied to any actual cosmic location, evokes the majesty and infinite possibilities of the universe—a testament to the power of imagination when pondering the wonders of the cosmos.

What mean {text{real}} , does people write like this?","completion":"In the context of writing mathematical equations or functions in LaTeX (which is a typesetting system commonly used for scientific documents), the use of \`text{}\` is normal to include text within mathematical expressions. The \`text{}\` command allows you to write words that are not variables in a mathematical formula so that they are not mistaken for mathematical symbols. In the formula I provided, \`text{real}\` and \`text{dom}\` within the LaTeX context are used to differentiate these words as descriptive text rather than as mathematical symbols or variables. When rendered from LaTeX, \\"real\\" and \\"dom\\" would appear as normal text within the mathematical expression. However, in normal non-LaTeX text or when writing on a whiteboard or paper, you would not use \`text{}\`. Instead, you would just write the descriptive words in plain text. In a typical mathematical notation without LaTeX coding, it might look something like this: - ( MC = 50 times 10^6 ) if the influence of poor Jeets is dominant, - ( MC = MC_{text{real}} ) otherwise, where: - ( MC ) is the market capitalization of the project, - ( MC_{text{real}} ) is the real market capitalization of the project. and you would clarify separately or in a footnote that \\"real\\" is an adjective describing the actual market capitalization without the dominating influence of \\"poor Jeets\\". In regular text, you'd just write it out without special formatting: \\"The market capitalization (MC) will be capped at 50 million dollars if the influence of poor Jeets is dominating (J_dom = 1), and it will reflect the real market capitalization (MC_real) if it's not (J_dom = 0).\\""},{"prompt":"explain this in baby talk","completion":"Alright!

I. Новая экономическая политика (НЭП) После Гражданской войны и \\"военного коммунизма\\", экономика России оказалась в крайне тяжелом состоянии. В 1921 году В. И. Ленин предложил ввести НЭП (Новая экономическая политика), целью которой было восстановление народного хозяйства путём введения ограниченных рыночных отношений, при сохранении государственного контроля над \\"командными высотами экономики\\" - ключевыми отраслями промышленности, транспортом, торговлей. НЭП был направлен на признание частной собственности и предпринимательской инициативы, позволяя крестьянам продавать излишки своего товара после уплаты государственного налога продуктом. Это привело к возрождению рыночной торговли, мелкого бизнеса и даже частной промышленности. II. Образование 1920-е годы стали временем активных образовательных реформ. Среди них - кампания \\"ликбеза\\" (ликвидация безграмотности), в ходе которой были открыты тысячи школ и курсов для взрослых. Образование стало более доступным, что сыграло значительную роль в формировании нового образа советского человека. III. Создание СССР В декабре 1922 года после серии съездов и конференций было провозглашено создание Союза Советских Социалистических Республик (СССР). Это привело к формированию федеративного государства, включающего различные национальные образования на постимперском пространстве. Союзные республики получили собственные государственные органы и конституции, хотя реальная власть концентрировалась в руках ВКП(б) и её руководства в Москве. IV. Внутрипартийная борьба за власть После смерти Ленина в 1924 году внутри ВКП(б) началась борьба за власть. Основными противниками в борьбе стали Иосиф Сталин, Лев Троцкий, Григорий Зиновьев и Лев Каменев. Постепенно Сталин удалось укрепить свои позиции и вытеснить конкурентов со сцены. К концу 1920-х годов он фактически оформил свою власть как лидер советского государства и партии, начав процесс сталинизации политической жизни. Подводя итог, можно сказать, что 1920-е годы ознаменовались серьёзными экономическими реформами, активным развитием образования, формированием советского федеративного государства и ужесточением внутрипартийной борьбы, что определило дальнейшее развитие СССР на десятилетия вперёд."},{"prompt":"Доклад на тему: Советская Россия в 1920-е годы: НЭ, образование СССР, внутрипартийная борьба за власть.","completion":"Доклад на тему: \\"Советская Россия в 1920-е годы: Новая экономическая политика, образование, создание СССР, внутрипартийная борьба за власть\\" Вступление: 1920-ые годы стали периодом значительных преобразований советской России. Это время характеризуется кардинальными экономическими перемены, реформированием системы образования, изменениями в политической структуре страны в результате создания СССР, а также внутрипартийной борьбой, последствия которой были ощущаемы в течение нескольких последующих десятилетий. 1. Новая экономическая политика (НЭП) НЭП была введена в 1921 году как временная стратегия для восстановления экономики, разрушенной Первой мировой войной, революцией и последующей Гражданской войной. После \\"военного коммунизма\\", который предусматривал жёсткий государственный контроль и национализацию всех отраслей, НЭП ознаменовал собой курс на частичное возвращение к рыночной экономике. Стратегия позволяла частной торговле, крестьянам продавать излишки продукции после уплаты налога продуктом, а также возвращала в оборот небольшие промышленные и сельскохозяйственные предприятия. Результаты НЭП были двойственными: с одной стороны, они стимулировали экономическое возрождение и улучшение жизни населения, с другой – вызвали обострение классовых противоречий и усиление недовольства внутри коммунистической партии. 2. Образование В области образования в 1920-е годы были предприняты попытки массовой ликвидации безграмотности через кампанию \\"ликбез\\". Работники Комсомола и педагоги проводили уроки грамотности среди взрослого населения. Высшее и среднее специальное образование развивалось тоже стремительно. Создавалась система рабфаков (рабочих факультетов), позволяющая рабочим и крестьянам получить среднее и высшее образование. Образование в СССР стремилось к пропагандированию идей социализма и коммунизма, формированию лояльности к новой власти и идеологии. 3. Создание СССР Высшим этапом трансформации государственного строя постимперской России стало создание СССР в 1922 году. Формально, новое государство было федерацией, в которую вошли республики с собственными правительствами и конституциями, но реальный контроль осуществлялся центральным руководством коммунистической партии. Этот шаг стал началом процесса интеграции и централизации власти в руках ВКП(б). 4. Внутрипартийная борьба за власть После смерти В. И. Ленина в 1924 году внутри ВКП(б) разгорелась острая борьба за лидерство. Основной конфликт развернулся между Иосифом Сталиным и Львом Троцким, в конечном итоге был выигран Сталиным. Череда политических интриг и манипуляций привела к тому, что к концу десятилетия Сталин укрепил свои позиции как глава партии и государства, начав период сталинизма. Заключение: 1920-ые годы были временем обновления и перемен для советской России. НЭП дал толчок экономическому развитию после лет разрухи, в образовании были предприняты шаги по массовой ликбезу и созданию новой системы образования, создание СССР заложило фундамент для дальнейшей судьбы страны, а внутрипартийная борьба за власть определила вектор дальнейшего политического развития. Эти преобразования оказали огромное влияние как на внутреннюю жизнь страны, так и на её международный имидж и политику."},{"prompt":"Напиши через запятую прилагательные, которые характеризуют абстрактную живопись","completion":"неструктурированная, выразительная, таинственная, цветовая, эмоциональная, динамичная, многогранная, символическая, нефигуративная, интуитивная, экспрессивная, креативная, неконкретная, ассоциативная."},{"prompt":"Напиши через запятую прилагательные, которые противоположные абстрактной живописи","completion":"реалистичная, конкретная, фигуративная, предметная, натуралистичная, детализированная, точная, классическая, традиционная, иллюстративная, объективная, репрезентативная, линейная, чёткая."},{"prompt":"Напиши через запятую прилагательные, которые характеризуют советскую фото 1930","completion":"пропагандистская, стилизованная, идеологическая, монументальная, героизирующая, патриотичная, репортажная, социалистическая, документальная, стагнирующая, контролируемая, кадрированная, стандартизированная, агитационная, массовая."},{"prompt":"Напиши через запятую прилагательные, которые противоположные советской фото 1930","completion":"независимая, аполитичная, спонтанная, неретушированная, личностная, критическая, деидеологизированная, нефильтрованная, индивидуализированная, импрессионистская, неформальная, неконтролируемая, экспериментальная, свободная, разножанровая."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

He needs to get some information on a empty usb stick for a detective friend of his. He has long black hair and lipstick. He wears a tan trenchcoat, nylon stockings, leather gloves and heeled knee-length boots. He is a crossdressing theatre actor. He is in his early 20s. It's day. While the stuff he needs to put is being copied onto the stick, he browses around the internet on his bully's computer while casually applying lip liner. The stuff he looks up is where to find German WW2 uniforms in Japan (for acting and aesthetic purposes ofc), a page for a Nintendo Wii and how to be better at acting even if he is pretty good at it. His detective friend is currently outside reading a manual on how to fix a piano keyboard. He is in his early 30s.","completion":"Title: The Masquerade Maneuver [Interior: a sleek, modern high-rise corporate office in downtown Tokyo, sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows.] Scene opens with the luminous skyline filtering through an impostor's veil. KAITO, a young man in a tan trenchcoat, slips into the high-rise office building with a nimble grace. With his long black hair swaying and the click of his heeled boots on the polished floor, he embodies an enigma wrapped in the guise of gender fluidity. His lean fingers, gloved in supple leather, push open the door to an executive office—his erstwhile bully's sanctum. As Kaito closes the door behind him, the camera focuses on his confident stride, his lips a streak of rebellion adorned in ruby red. He approaches the mahogany desk and unearths a sleek USB stick, plugging it into the computer with seductive certitude. The screen flickers to life. His fingers dance across the keyboard, navigating a secret maze as he initiates the data transfer, a subtle smile gracing his features. Whilst the loading bar creeps across the screen, Kaito leans back, idly browsing the internet. First, he types in a search for 'German WW2 Uniforms in Japan,' his eyes a glint with theatrical fervor. Tabs upon tabs of vintage shops and collectors forums dot the screen; an actor's treasure trove illuminating the room. A cutaway to the world outside—the streets bustling, an ever-moving tableau of city life. Detective HAYATO leans against his car, a manual splayed across the hood as he troubleshoots the stubborn keys of a piano keyboard. His brows are furrowed, the lines of concentration etched like staves on a musical score. Back in the office, Kaito, now scrolling through an auction page for a Nintendo Wii, adds it to the bully's cart with a cheeky flourish. A nod to simpler days, perhaps, or a silent jab at the man who'd tormented him. The search bar blinks, poised, as Kaito taps in 'acting techniques.' Even in his natural talent, his thirst for improvement is unquenchable. He scans articles on method acting and Stanislavski's system, his lips pursing as he reapplies lip liner, ensuring each stroke mirrors the perfection of his craft. The USB stick emits a soft 'ding,' signaling the completion of its clandestine task. Kaito deftly ejects it, the secrets now carried within as though ghosts captured in silicon. Standing, Kaito silhouettes against the panoramic view, his coat billowing slightly as if he himself were a character in a play, elevated beyond the sordid scripts of everyday spite. He strides out of the office, the USB his victory flag, passing it to Hayato, who casts a knowing glance at his accomplice. Their stage, the city; their audience, unaware—two maestros of their own intricate theater where justice is the ultimate performance. CUT TO BLACK.

It's used to convert an image to a binary image (black and white), using an algorithm that determines the threshold for a pixel based on a small region around it. This method is useful in cases where the image has different lighting conditions in different areas. Here's the definition of the \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` function: \`\`\`python dst = cv.adaptiveThreshold(src, maxValue, adaptiveMethod, thresholdType, blockSize, C) \`\`\` - \`src\`: Source image, which should be a grayscale image (single channel). - \`maxValue\`: The value to assign to the pixels that are determined to be foreground (usually set to 255 for white). - \`adaptiveMethod\`: The adaptive method to use: - \`cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C\`: The threshold value is the mean of the neighbourhood area minus the constant \`C\`. - \`cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C\`: The threshold value is the weighted sum of the neighbourhood values where weights are a Gaussian window minus the constant \`C\`. - \`thresholdType\`: The type of thresholding to apply. This is usually \`cv.THRESH_BINARY\` or \`cv.THRESH_BINARY_INV\`. - \`blockSize\`: The size of the neighbourhood area (it must be an odd number like 3, 5, 7, etc.). - \`C\`: A constant that is subtracted from the mean or weighted mean calculated. Here's an example of how you might use the \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` function: \`\`\`python import cv2 as cv # Read an image in grayscale mode img = cv.imread('image.jpg', cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) # Apply adaptive thresholding thresh = cv.adaptiveThreshold(img, 255, cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2) # Display the thresholded image cv.imshow('Adaptive Threshold', thresh) cv.waitKey(0) cv.destroyAllWindows() \`\`\` In this example, \`cv.imread\` reads the image with the \`cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE\` flag to ensure it's in grayscale. The \`adaptiveThreshold\` function then processes the image with a block size of 11 and a constant of \\"2\\" for \`C\`. The method used is the mean adaptive method, and the threshold type is binary, meaning pixels will be set to 0 or \`maxValue\` (in this case, 255)."},{"prompt":"Как сделать чтобы cv.adaptiveThreshold работал так-же, как и cv.Threshold","completion":"Функция \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` в OpenCV предназначена для адаптивной бинаризации изображений, что означает, что пороговое значение для каждого пикселя определяется на основе его окрестности. Это отличается от функции \`cv.threshold\`, которая применяет глобальное пороговое значение ко всему изображению. Если вы хотите, чтобы \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` по возможности вел себя похоже на \`cv.threshold\`, вы можете выбрать очень большое значение \`blockSize\`, чтобы окрестность была достаточно большой и включала в себя почти все изображение. Однако это не гарантирует аналогичное поведение, потому что сам подход к определению порога отличается фундаментально. Для симуляции работы \`cv.threshold\` с помощью \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\`, вам нужно использовать размер блока, который близок к размеру всего изображения, и установить значение \`C\`, равное среднему значению всех пикселей изображения или значению глобального порога, если вы его знаете. Вот примерный код, который пытается сделать \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` похожим на \`cv.threshold\`: \`\`\`python import cv2 as cv import numpy as np # Загрузка изображения в режиме оттенков серого img = cv.imread('image.jpg', cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) # Вычисление среднего значения всех пикселей изображения mean_value = np.mean(img) # Применение метода адаптивной бинаризации с большим размером блока block_size = min(img.shape[:2]) // 2 if block_size % 2 == 0: # blockSize должен быть нечетным block_size += 1 # Используем среднее значение изображения как константу C adaptive_thresh = cv.adaptiveThreshold(img, 255, cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv.THRESH_BINARY, block_size, mean_value) # Отображение бинаризованного изображения cv.imshow('Adaptive Threshold', adaptive_thresh) cv.waitKey(0) cv.destroyAllWindows() \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что данный подход всё равно не обеспечит точное соответствие между \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` и \`cv.threshold\`, поскольку сам механизм работы этих функций различен. Если вам нужно применить глобальный порог, лучше всего воспользоваться функцией \`cv.threshold\`."},{"prompt":"Американское общество религиозно?","completion":"Оценка религиозности американского общества может быть достаточно субъективным вопросом, так как определение \\"религиозности\\" может варьировать в зависимости от того, как именно мы ее измеряем — через уровень участия в церковных службах, через личные взгляды о вере и практике, или через влияние религиозных убеждений на общественную и политическую жизнь. Тем не менее, по большинству исследований, Соединенные Штаты Америки традиционно считаются одним из более религиозных развитых стран мира. Большая часть американцев утверждает, что вера играет важную роль в их жизни, и значительное количество людей регулярно посещает религиозные службы. Однако динамики последних десятилетий показывают некоторые изменения в этом тренде. Исследования, такие как опросы Pew Research Center и других организаций, фиксируют снижение уровня религиозной принадлежности и участия в религиозных службах, особенно среди молодежи. В то же время увеличивается число людей, идентифицирующих себя как не связанные ни с одной религией (иногда их называют \\"nones\\"), что включает атеистов, агностиков и просто тех, кто не принадлежит к определенной религиозной общине. Религия по-прежнему оказывает сильное влияние на американскую культуру и политику. Вопросы, связанные с религией и вероисповеданием, часто оказываются в центре социальных и политических дебатов, таких как обсуждение абортов, прав ЛГБТК+ и свободы вероисповедания. Итак, в целом можно утверждать, что американское общество по-прежнему во многих отношениях религиозно, хотя и присутствуют тенденции к секуляризации, особенно в определенных демографических группах."},{"prompt":"Серая и черно-белая оценка мира","completion":"Серая и черно-белая оценка мира — это фигура речи, используемая для описания способов восприятия и интерпретации событий, людей и ситуаций. Обе концепции могут быть применены в разных контекстах, включая психологию, философию, литературу и повседневную речь. 1. Черно-белая оценка мира: Этот термин относится к тенденции видеть вещи в категорических терминах, без учета возможных оттенков и нюансов. Принятие строгих дихотомий (\\"хорошо\\" против \\"плохо\\", \\"правильно\\" против \\"неправильно\\") характеризует черно-белое мышление. Люди, которые руководствуются черно-белым восприятием, склонны интерпретировать комплексные ситуации простым и ясным образом, игнорируя богатство деталей и разнообразие перспектив. 2. Серая оценка мира: Серая оценка мира предполагает более сбалансированный, гибкий и открытый способ мышления. Этот термин признает, что реальность часто обладает множеством оттенков серого, что означает сложность, неоднозначность и вариативность. Серое мышление принимает в расчет компромиссы, неполные решения и смешение противоположных позиций. Люди, предпочитающие серую оценку мира, часто лучше справляются со сложными задачами и решают конфликты, находя средний путь между крайностями. Важно понимать, что ни один из этих способов мышления не является \\"правильным\\" или \\"неправильным\\". Однако способность приспосабливаться и применять более гибкий подход к оценке реальности, как правило, может обеспечить более точное понимание сложных проблем и способствовать более эффективному решению проблем и взаимодействию с окружающим миром."},{"prompt":"Какие есть аргументы за и против эвтаназии или убийство ребёнка во время беременности (приостановка беременности)","completion":"Следует осторожно обращаться с этими темами, так как они являются чрезвычайно сложными, этически нагруженными и могут вызывать сильные эмоциональные реакции. Термин \\"убийство ребенка во время беременности\\" не соответствует общепринятой терминологии и может быть воспринят как предвзятый; более нейтральный термин — это \\"аборт\\" или \\"прерывание беременности\\". Эвтаназия и аборт — разные этические вопросы, поэтому важно рассматривать их отдельно. Ниже приведены аргументы \\"за\\" и \\"против\\" для каждого из них: Эвтаназия (иногда называемая \\"мерси киллинг\\" или \\"добровольное окончание жизни\\"): За эвтаназию: 1. Компасcия и облегчение страданий: Позволяет тяжело больным людям умереть с достоинством, предотвращая неизбежные и невыносимые страдания. 2. Личная автономия: Уважение к личному выбору индивида в отношении его конца жизни и право человека контролировать свое тело и судьбу. 3. Медицинские ресурсы: Освобождает медицинские ресурсы и средства здравоохранения, которые могут быть израсходованы на безнадежно больных. Против эвтаназии: 1. Санктитет жизни: Аргумент основан на убеждении, что жизнь неотделима и не должна прерываться искусственно. 2. Скользкая дорожка: Опасения, что узаконивание эвтаназии может привести к злоупотреблениям и росту давления на уязвимых людей. 3. Возможность облегчения боли: Современные медицинские технологии и паллиативная помощь могут сделать страдания управляемыми без прекращения жизни. Аборт: За аборт: 1. Права женщин: Уважение к праву женщины на контроль над своим телом и репродуктивным выбором, включая решение о продолжении или прерывании беременности. 2. Здоровье и благополучие: Аборт может быть средством сохранения физического и психического здоровья женщины, особенно в случаях, когда беременность является результатом изнасилования или угрожает жизни. 3. Социальные и экономические обстоятельства: Наличие опции аборта позволяет женщинам принимать решения, основанные на их социальных и экономических обстоятельствах. Против аборта: 1. Права нерожденных детей: Позиция основана на вере в то, что нерожденные дети обладают правами с момента зачатия и их жизнь должна быть защищена. 2. Моральные и религиозные убеждения: Во многих религиях аборт считается грехом и морально неприемлемым. 3. Потенциальные негативные последствия: Аборт может иметь долгосрочные психологические последствия для женщины, а также считается, что он может негативно сказаться на ценности жизни в обществе. При обсуждении этих вопросов крайне важно подходить к ним с уважением и чуткостью, осознавая, что за любой позицией стоит сложный набор личных убеждений, эмоциональных реакций и этических соображений."},{"prompt":"Какие есть за и против узаконивания казни","completion":"Смертная казнь — один из наиболее спорных вопросов в сфере права и этики. Вот некоторые аргументы за и против узаконивания смертной казни: Аргументы за смертную казнь: 1. Отмщение/возмездие: Считается, что смертная казнь должна служить формой возмездия за очень тяжкие преступления, такие как убийство, и что это наиболее справедливый способ наказать преступника, посягнувшего на чью-то жизнь. 2. Превентивное сдерживание: Существует мнение, что угроза смертной казни может действовать как сдерживающий фактор, предотвращая серьезные преступления, хотя эта точка зрения широко оспаривается исследованиями. 3. Обеспечение безопасности общества: Утверждается, что смертная казнь устраняет риск того, что преступники совершат повторные преступления, обеспечивая тем самым безопасность общества. 4. Экономическая эффективность: Иногда утверждается, что содержание осужденных на пожизненное заключение обходится государству дороже, чем их казнь, хотя и это утверждение противоречиво, так как многие исследования показывают высокую стоимость судебных разбирательств по делам о смертной казни. Аргументы против смертной казни: 1. Право на жизнь: Критики смертной казни утверждают, что у каждого человека есть неотъемлемое право на жизнь, даже если он совершил ужасное преступление. 2. Риск ошибочного приговора: Возможность осудить на смерть невинного человека считается ужасающим и необратимым. Исторически есть случаи, когда осужденные были казнены, а позже признаны невиновными. 3. Отсутствие доказательств сдерживающего эффекта: Многие исследования не нашли убедительных доказательств того, что смертная казнь действует как эффективное средство предотвращения преступлений больше, чем пожизненное заключение. 4. Неравенство в правосудии: Существуют серьезные опасения по поводу расовых, этнических и социально-экономических предвзятостей в применении смертной казни, что может привести к несправедливому наказанию некоторых групп населения. 5. Гуманизм и мораль: Некоторые считают, что государство не должно участвовать в убийстве людей, так как это является актом жестокости и подрывает моральные ценности общества. 6. Международные стандарты прав человека: Во многих культурах и религии смертная казнь рассматривается как нарушение основных человеческих прав. Всемирная декларация прав человека ООН и другие международные договора стремятся к упразднению смертной казни. Важно отметить, что эти аргументы представляют общие точки зрения и могут отличаться в разных культурных, религиозных и личных контекстах. Обсуждение смертной казни поднимает глубокие вопросы о правосудии, этике, ценности человеческой жизни и роли государства."},{"prompt":"Ты нее указал отрицательный факт появления института казни, который узаконивает смерть, что может развязать руки людям в этом институте","completion":"Вы правы, среди аргументов против смертной казни стоит упомянуть потенциальную опасность злоупотреблений властью со стороны тех, кто авторизован проводить исполнение приговоров. Вот уточненный список аргументов против смертной казни, включая указанный вами аспект: 1. Право на жизнь: Право каждого человека на жизнь является фундаментальным, и многие считают, что государство не должно иметь власть лишать человека жизни. 2. Риск ошибочного приговора: Смертная казнь необратима, и ошибки в правосудии, ведущие к казни невиновных людей, не могут быть исправлены после экзекуции. 3. Отсутствие доказательств сдерживающего эффекта: Исследования не находят убедительного подтверждения того, что смертная казнь оказывает более сильное предупреждающее воздействие на потенциальных преступников, нежели пожизненное заключение. 4. Неравенство в правосудии: Система, в которой смертная казнь применяется неравномерно и предвзято, порождает серьезную несправедливость, особенно по отношению к меньшинствам и малообеспеченным группам населения. 5. Негуманность и моральные возражения: Многие люди считают смертную казнь неэтичной и жестокой практикой, несовместимой с основными ценностями гуманного общества. 6. Международная тенденция к упразднению: Со временем многие страны отказались от смертной казни, и она остается несовместимой со многими международными соглашениями о правах человека. 7. Риски злоупотреблений властью: Существование смертной казни может дать властям слишком большое усмотрение в праве решать, кто должен жить, а кто — умереть, что потенциально создает условия для злоупотреблений, политически мотивированных казней или несправедливого применения закона. 8. Моральное бремя: Вовлечение в процессы смертной казни налагает тяжелое моральное бремя на судей, адвокатов, сотрудников исправительных учреждений и общество в целом. 9. Альтернативы: Предлагаются другие формы наказания, такие как пожизненное лишение свободы без возможности досрочного освобождения, которые могут гарантировать безопасность общества и дать осужденным время для раскаяния и реабилитации без окончательного и необратимого шага, каким является смертная казнь. Эти аргументы помогают выявить глубокие этические, юридические и социальные дилеммы, связанные с существованием смертной казни, и почему эта практика является предметом продолжающихся дебатов в многих странах мира."},{"prompt":"В чём разница между федерацией и конфедерацией?","completion":"Федерация и конфедерация — это две формы политических объединений, которые включают в себя несколько государственных или региональных единиц. Основное различие между федерацией и конфедерацией заключается в степени централизации власти и в суверенитете участвующих единиц. Федерация: - В федерации участвующие региональные или государственные единицы (штаты, провинции, кантоны и т. д.) передают определенные полномочия центральному правительству, сохраняя при этом свой суверенитет в ряде вопросов. - Центральное (федеральное) правительство обладает значительной властью и обычно отвечает за внешнюю политику, оборону, национальную валюту, федеральное законодательство и другие вопросы, которые принято решать на национальном уровне. - Федеральные системы обеспечивают баланс между общими интересами государства в целом и особенностями каждой региональной единицы. Примеры включают Соединенные Штаты Америки, Российскую Федерацию, Федеративную Республику Германию. Конфедерация: - В конфедерации региональные или государственные единицы сохраняют свои суверенитет, объединяясь для решения определенного круга вопросов, таких как оборона или внешняя торговля. - Органы конфедерации обладают ограниченными полномочиями и действуют в соответствии с решениями участвующих единиц, которые чаще всего сохраняют право одностороннего выхода из объединения. - Конфедеративные системы имеют менее строгий характер, чем федеративные, и меньше централизованной власти. Примером исторической конфедерации может служить Швейцарский союз в своей ранней форме или Конфедерация независимых государств (СНГ). Помимо фундаментальных различий в структуре власти и суверенитета, еще одна важная разница между федерацией и конфедерацией состоит в том, как понимается законодательная власть. В федерации существует двухуровневая система законодательства, где федеральные законы имеют преимущество над законами отдельных регионов, в то время как в конфедерации законы членов конфедерации часто имеют больше веса, чем решения центрального органа. В современном мире чистые формы конфедераций довольно редки, так как большинство государственных объединений со временем либо становятся более интегрированными федерациями, либо распадаются на отдельные суверенные государства."},{"prompt":"QT C++ Project Error: msvc-version.conf loaded but QMAKE_MSC_VER isn't set","completion":"The error message \\"msvc-version.conf loaded but QMAKE_MSC_VER isn't set\\" usually indicates a configuration problem with your Qt setup for a C++ project using Microsoft Visual Studio as the compiler. QMAKE_MSC_VER is an internal variable that Qt's qmake build system tool uses to determine the version of the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler being used. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue: 1. Ensure Qt is properly installed: Make sure you've installed the version of Qt that corresponds with your version of Microsoft Visual Studio. During the Qt installation process, you should select the MSVC-related component that matches the version of Visual Studio installed on your system. 2. Set up environment variables: Make sure the environment variables for Qt and Visual Studio are correctly set. For example, ensure that the PATH variable includes the paths to both Qt's bin directory and Visual Studio's bin directory. 3. Launch from Visual Studio Command Prompt: Using the Visual Studio Command Prompt can help set the correct environment for your development session, as it initializes the necessary Visual Studio environment variables. Try starting Qt Creator or running qmake from a Visual Studio Command Prompt that matches the version of Visual Studio you're using with Qt. 4. Configure the Kit in Qt Creator: Open Qt Creator and go to Tools > Options > Kits. Check that the kit you are using for your project is configured with the correct version of the MSVC compiler. You might need to select the right compiler under the Compiler option for your kit. 5. Check the Qt Version in Qt Creator: In Qt Creator, go to Tools > Options > Qt Versions and verify that the Qt version you are targeting is associated with the correct MSVC version. 6. Re-run qmake: Sometimes, simply re-running qmake can resolve configuration issues. In Qt Creator, you can do this by going to Build > Run qmake. 7. Clean and Rebuild: If all else fails, you may need to clean the project and rebuild it. This gives you a fresh start and can clear up issues related to outdated build configurations. In Qt Creator, you can do this by selecting Build > Clean All followed by Build > Rebuild All. 8. Check for Issues with the .pro File: Look inside your project's .pro file to ensure there are no incorrect configurations set that might be causing the issue with QMAKE_MSC_VER. If you continue to experience problems, make sure you're using compatible versions of Qt and Microsoft Visual Studio. It's possible that updates or changes to either may have introduced incompatibilities, and using officially supported combinations can help avoid these issues. Finally, restarting Qt Creator or your system could also help, as this would clear up any environment issues that might have been transient. If problems persist, consider seeking help from the Qt community or forums with details about your specific setup."},{"prompt":"НАпиши на русском","completion":"Ошибка \\"msvc-version.conf loaded but QMAKE_MSC_VER isn't set\\" обычно указывает на проблему конфигурации вашего проекта на Qt для С++ с использованием компилятора Microsoft Visual Studio. QMAKE_MSC_VER — это внутренняя переменная, которую инструмент сборки qmake от Qt использует для определения версии используемого компилятора Microsoft Visual Studio. Вот несколько шагов, которые вы можете предпринять, чтобы решить эту проблему: 1. Убедитесь, что Qt установлен правильно: Установите версию Qt, соответствующую вашей версии Microsoft Visual Studio. В процессе установки Qt необходимо выбрать компонент, связанный с MSVC, который соответствует установленной на вашем системе версии Visual Studio. 2. Настройка переменных среды: Удостоверьтесь, что переменные среды для Qt и Visual Studio заданы корректно. Например, проверьте, включены ли в переменную PATH пути к директориям bin Qt и bin Visual Studio. 3. Запуск из командной строки Visual Studio: Использование командной строки Visual Studio может помочь установить правильную среду для вашей разработки, так как она инициализирует необходимые переменные среды Visual Studio. Попробуйте запустить Qt Creator или выполнить qmake из командной строки Visual Studio, соответствующей версии Visual Studio, которую вы используете с Qt. 4. Настройте комплект в Qt Creator: Откройте Qt Creator и перейдите в Раздел Инструменты (Tools) > Настройки (Options) > Комплекты (Kits). Проверьте, что комплект, который вы используете для проекта, настроен с правильной версией компилятора MSVC. Возможно, вам нужно будет выбрать правильный компилятор в опциях компилятора для вашего комплекта. 5. Проверьте версию Qt в Qt Creator: В Qt Creator перейдите в Раздел Инструменты (Tools) > Настройки (Options) > Версии Qt (Qt Versions) и удостоверьтесь, что целевая версия Qt связана с правильной версией MSVC. 6. Повторно выполните qmake: Иногда повторный запуск qmake может решить проблемы конфигурации. В Qt Creator это можно сделать через Сборка (Build) > Запустить qmake (Run qmake). 7. Очистка и пересборка: Если ничего не помогает, возможно, потребуется очистить проект и пересобрать его. Это даст возможность начать заново и может устранить проблемы, связанные с устаревшими настройками сборки. В Qt Creator это можно сделать выбрав Сборка (Build) > Очистить всё (Clean All), за которым следует Сборка (Build) > Пересобрать всё (Rebuild All). 8. Проверка файла .pro: Просмотрите файл .pro вашего проекта, чтобы убедиться, что в нем нет неправильных настроек, которые могут вызвать проблему с QMAKE_MSC_VER. Если у вас продолжают возникать проблемы, убедитесь, что вы используете совместимые версии Qt и Microsoft Visual Studio. Использование официально поддерживаемых комбинаций может помочь избежать этих проблем. Наконец, перезапуск Qt Creator или вашей системы также может помочь, так как это может очистить любые проблемы среды, которые могли быть временными. Если проблемы не устраняются, рассмотрите возможность обращения за помощью к сообществу Qt или на форумы с подробной информацией о вашей конкретной настройке."},{"prompt":"mainwindow.obj:-1: ошибка: LNK2019: ббл«Є ­ ­Ґа §аҐиҐ­­л© ў­Ґи­Ё© бЁ¬ў®« \\"__declspec(dllimport) public: virtual __cdecl Qt3DExtras::QOrbitCameraController::~QOrbitCameraController(void)\\" (__imp_??1QOrbitCameraController@Qt3DExtras@@UEAA@XZ) ў дг­ЄжЁЁ \\"public: virtual void * __cdecl Qt3DExtras::QOrbitCameraController::\`scalar deleting destructor'(unsigned int)\\" (??_GQOrbitCameraController@Qt3DExtras@@UEAAPEAXI@Z).","completion":"Ошибка LNK2019, с которой вы столкнулись, относится к классу ошибок linker (связывателя) в Microsoft Visual Studio и указывает на невозможность найти определение для ссылки на функцию.

Возможные причины этой проблемы могут включать: 1. Вы забыли добавить необходимую библиотеку Qt3DExtras в список зависимостей проекта в Visual Studio. Убедитесь, что вы подключили соответствующие библиотеки Qt3D в своем проекте. 2. Попытка использовать несовместимую версию библиотеки Qt3DExtras. Если вы обновили Qt или смешали компоненты из разных версий Qt, это может привести к ошибкам связывания. 3. Ваш проект не корректно настроен для сборки с использованием соответствующего компилятора или архитектуры (например, x86 против x64), что приводит к невозможности нахождения реализации в бинарных файлах библиотеки. 4. Файл проекта Qt (.pro) или файл настройки проекта CMake, если вы их используете, не содержат правильных инструкций для подключения всех необходимых для Qt3DExtras библиотек. Решение этих проблем может заключаться в следующем: - Проверьте, включены ли в ваш проект все необходимые библиотеки Qt3D с помощью конструкции \`QT += 3dextras\` в файле проекта Qt (.pro) или соответствующих директив в CMakeLists.txt. - Если вы используете qmake для генерации проектных файлов, убедитесь, что вы перегенерировали их после изменения конфигурации Qt. - Проверьте настройки вашего проекта в Visual Studio и убедитесь, что правильно задана конфигурация целевой платформы (например, Win32 или x64). - После изменения настроек, очистите и пересоберите весь проект, чтобы убедиться, что все зависимости были правильно обновлены. - Убедитесь, что используемые версии Qt совместимы с вашим компилятором и целевой системой. В случае использования предкомпилированных бинарников Qt, они должны соответствовать версии вашего компилятора."},{"prompt":"Qt отключение теневой сборки","completion":"Теневая сборка (Shadow Build) в Qt Creator - это полезная функция, позволяющая сохранять исходные коды и временные файлы сборки (такие как объектные файлы и исполняемые файлы) в разных директориях. Это позволяет легко очищать сборки и поддерживать чистоту в структуре проекта, а также обеспечивать отдельные каталоги сборки для разных конфигураций (например, для отладки и выпуска). Если вы решите отключить теневую сборку в Qt Creator, вам нужно выполнить следующие действия: 1. Откройте Qt Creator и в меню выберите \\"Файл\\" -> \\"Открыть файл или проект...\\" (или \\"File\\" -> \\"Open File or Project...\\") и загрузите проект (* .pro файл). 2. В панели проектов слева выберите нужный проект. 3. В разделе сборки (\\"Build\\") для выбранного набора инструментов (комплекта, или \\"Kit\\") найдите раздел \\"Теневая сборка\\" (\\"Shadow build\\"). 4. Снимите галочку с опции \\"Теневая сборка\\" (или \\"Shadow build\\"), чтобы отключить её для текущего комплекта инструментов. 5. Примените изменения и закройте настройки. После этих действий файлы сборки будут сохраняться в каталоге с исходным кодом проекта, а не в отдельной директории теневой сборки. Обратите внимание, что если вы уже собирали проект с включенной теневой сборкой, вам может потребоваться очистить эти директории вручную, так как Qt Creator не делает этого автоматически при отключении функции. Теневая сборка поддерживается как в qmake, так и в системах сборки на основе CMake. Процедура отключения может незначительно различаться в зависимости от используемой системы сборки и настроек проекта. В случае CMake возможность использования теневой сборки регулируется напрямую через выбор директории для сборки в командной строке или через графический интерфейс, где вы конфигурируете проект."},{"prompt":"У меня есть массив картинок которые были считаны с помощью OpenCV.

Here is the chapter 4: Those who have read the first part of this story will perhaps remember an old wood-cutter who lived in the depths of the forest.1 Tandang Selo is still alive, and though his hair has turned completely white, he yet preserves his good health. He no longer hunts or cuts firewood, for his fortunes have improved and he works only at making brooms. His son Tales (abbreviation of Telesforo) had worked at first on shares on the lands of a capitalist, but later, having become the owner of two carabaos and several hundred pesos, determined to work on his own account, aided by his father, his wife, and his three children. So they cut down and cleared away some thick woods which were situated on the borders of the town and which they believed belonged to no one. During the labors of cleaning and cultivating the new land, the whole family fell ill with malaria and the mother died, along with the eldest daughter, Lucia, in the flower of her age. This, which was the natural consequence of breaking up new soil infested with various kinds of bacteria, they attributed to the anger of the woodland spirit, so they were resigned and went on with their labor, believing him pacified. But when they began to harvest their first crop a religious corporation, which owned land in the neighboring town, laid claim to the fields, alleging that they fell within their boundaries, and to prove it they at once started to set up [31]their marks. However, the administrator of the religious order left to them, for humanity’s sake, the usufruct of the land on condition that they pay a small sum annually—a mere bagatelle, twenty or thirty pesos. Tales, as peaceful a man as could be found, was as much opposed to lawsuits as any one and more submissive to the friars than most people; so, in order not to smash a palyok against a kawali (as he said, for to him the friars were iron pots and he a clay jar), he had the weakness to yield to their claim, remembering that he did not know Spanish and had no money to pay lawyers. Besides, Tandang Selo said to him, “Patience! You would spend more in one year of litigation than in ten years of paying what the white padres demand. And perhaps they’ll pay you back in masses! Pretend that those thirty pesos had been lost in gambling or had fallen into the water and been swallowed by a cayman.” The harvest was abundant and sold well, so Tales planned to build a wooden house in the barrio of Sagpang, of the town of Tiani, which adjoined San Diego. Another year passed, bringing another good crop, and for this reason the friars raised the rent to fifty pesos, which Tales paid in order not to quarrel and because he expected to sell his sugar at a good price. “Patience! Pretend that the cayman has grown some,” old Selo consoled him. That year he at last saw his dream realized: to live in the barrio of Sagpang in a wooden house. The father and grandfather then thought of providing some education for the two children, especially the daughter Juliana, or Juli, as they called her, for she gave promise of being accomplished and beautiful. A boy who was a friend of the family, Basilio, was studying in Manila, and he was of as lowly origin as they. But this dream seemed destined not to be realized. The first care the community took when they saw the family prospering was to appoint as cabeza de barangay its most [32]industrious member, which left only Tano, the son, who was only fourteen years old. The father was therefore called Cabesang Tales and had to order a sack coat, buy a felt hat, and prepare to spend his money. In order to avoid any quarrel with the curate or the government, he settled from his own pocket the shortages in the tax-lists, paying for those who had died or moved away, and he lost considerable time in making the collections and on his trips to the capital. “Patience! Pretend that the cayman’s relatives have joined him,” advised Tandang Selo, smiling placidly. “Next year you’ll put on a long skirt and go to Manila to study like the young ladies of the town,” Cabesang Tales told his daughter every time he heard her talking of Basilio’s progress. But that next year did not come, and in its stead there was another increase in the rent. Cabesang Tales became serious and scratched his head. The clay jar was giving up all its rice to the iron pot. When the rent had risen to two hundred pesos, Tales was not content with scratching his head and sighing; he murmured and protested. The friar-administrator then told him that if he could not pay, some one else would be assigned to cultivate that land—many who desired it had offered themselves. He thought at first that the friar was joking, but the friar was talking seriously, and indicated a servant of his to take possession of the land. Poor Tales turned pale, he felt a buzzing in his ears, he saw in the red mist that rose before his eyes his wife and daughter, pallid, emaciated, dying, victims of the intermittent fevers—then he saw the thick forest converted into productive fields, he saw the stream of sweat watering its furrows, he saw himself plowing under the hot sun, bruising his feet against the stones and roots, while this friar had been driving about in his carriage with the wretch who was to get the land following like a slave behind his master. No, a thousand [33]times, no! First let the fields sink into the depths of the earth and bury them all! Who was this intruder that he should have any right to his land? Had he brought from his own country a single handful of that soil? Had he crooked a single one of his fingers to pull up the roots that ran through it? Exasperated by the threats of the friar, who tried to uphold his authority at any cost in the presence of the other tenants, Cabesang Tales rebelled and refused to pay a single cuarto, having ever before himself that red mist, saying that he would give up his fields to the first man who could irrigate it with blood drawn from his own veins. Old Selo, on looking at his son’s face, did not dare to mention the cayman, but tried to calm him by talking of clay jars, reminding him that the winner in a lawsuit was left without a shirt to his back. “We shall all be turned to clay, father, and without shirts we were born,” was the reply. So he resolutely refused to pay or to give up a single span of his land unless the friars should first prove the legality of their claim by exhibiting a title-deed of some kind. As they had none, a lawsuit followed, and Cabesang Tales entered into it, confiding that some at least, if not all, were lovers of justice and respecters of the law. “I serve and have been serving the King with my money and my services,” he said to those who remonstrated with him. “I’m asking for justice and he is obliged to give it to me.” Drawn on by fatality, and as if he had put into play in the lawsuit the whole future of himself and his children, he went on spending his savings to pay lawyers, notaries, and solicitors, not to mention the officials and clerks who exploited his ignorance and his needs. He moved to and fro between the village and the capital, passed his days without eating and his nights without sleeping, while his talk was always about briefs, exhibits, and appeals. There was then seen a struggle such as was never before carried on under the skies of the Philippines: that of a poor Indian, [34]ignorant and friendless, confiding in the justness and righteousness of his cause, fighting against a powerful corporation before which Justice bowed her head, while the judges let fall the scales and surrendered the sword. He fought as tenaciously as the ant which bites when it knows that it is going to be crushed, as does the fly which looks into space only through a pane of glass. Yet the clay jar defying the iron pot and smashing itself into a thousand pieces bad in it something impressive—it had the sublimeness of desperation! On the days when his journeys left him free he patrolled his fields armed with a shotgun, saying that the tulisanes were hovering around and he had need of defending himself in order not to fall into their hands and thus lose his lawsuit. As if to improve his marksmanship, he shot at birds and fruits, even the butterflies, with such accurate aim that the friar-administrator did not dare to go to Sagpang without an escort of civil-guards, while the friar’s hireling, who gazed from afar at the threatening figure of Tales wandering over the fields like a sentinel upon the walls, was terror stricken and refused to take the property away from him. But the local judges and those at the capital, warned by the experience of one of their number who had been summarily dismissed, dared not give him the decision, fearing their own dismissal. Yet they were not really bad men, those judges, they were upright and conscientious, good citizens, excellent fathers, dutiful sons—and they were able to appreciate poor Tales’ situation better than Tales himself could. Many of them were versed in the scientific and historical basis of property, they knew that the friars by their own statutes could not own property, but they also knew that to come from far across the sea with an appointment secured with great difficulty, to undertake the duties of the position with the best intentions, and now to lose it because an Indian fancied that justice had to be done on earth as in heaven—that surely was an idea! They had their [35]families and greater needs surely than that Indian: one had a mother to provide for, and what duty is more sacred than that of caring for a mother? Another had sisters, all of marriageable age; that other there had many little children who expected their daily bread and who, like fledglings in a nest, would surely die of hunger the day he was out of a job; even the very least of them had there, far away, a wife who would be in distress if the monthly remittance failed. All these moral and conscientious judges tried everything in their power in the way of counsel, advising Cabesang Tales to pay the rent demanded. But Tales, like all simple souls, once he had seen what was just, went straight toward it. He demanded proofs, documents, papers, title-deeds, but the friars had none of these, resting their case on his concessions in the past. Cabesang Tales’ constant reply was: “If every day I give alms to a beggar to escape annoyance, who will oblige me to continue my gifts if he abuses my generosity?” From this stand no one could draw him, nor were there any threats that could intimidate him. In vain Governor M—— made a trip expressly to talk to him and frighten him. His reply to it all was: “You may do what you like, Mr. Governor, I’m ignorant and powerless. But I’ve cultivated those fields, my wife and daughter died while helping me clear them, and I won’t give them up to any one but him who can do more with them than I’ve done. Let him first irrigate them with his blood and bury in them his wife and daughter!” The upshot of this obstinacy was that the honorable judges gave the decision to the friars, and everybody laughed at him, saying that lawsuits are not won by justice. But Cabesang Tales appealed, loaded his shotgun, and patrolled his fields with deliberation. During this period his life seemed to be a wild dream. His son, Tano, a youth as tall as his father and as good as his sister, was conscripted, but he let the boy go rather than purchase a substitute.[36] “I have to pay the lawyers,” he told his weeping daughter. “If I win the case I’ll find a way to get him back, and if I lose it I won’t have any need for sons.” So the son went away and nothing more was heard of him except that his hair had been cropped and that he slept under a cart. Six months later it was rumored that he had been seen embarking for the Carolines; another report was that he had been seen in the uniform of the Civil Guard. “Tano in the Civil Guard! ’Susmariosep!” exclaimed several, clasping their hands. “Tano, who was so good and so honest! Requimternam!” The grandfather went many days without speaking to the father, Juli fell sick, but Cabesang Tales did not shed a single tear, although for two days he never left the house, as if he feared the looks of reproach from the whole village or that he would be called the executioner of his son. But on the third day he again sallied forth with his shotgun. Murderous intentions were attributed to him, and there were well-meaning persons who whispered about that he had been heard to threaten that he would bury the friar-administrator in the furrows of his fields, whereat the friar was frightened at him in earnest. As a result of this, there came a decree from the Captain-General forbidding the use of firearms and ordering that they be taken up. Cabesang Tales had to hand over his shotgun but he continued his rounds armed with a long bolo. “What are you going to do with that bolo when the tulisanes have firearms?” old Selo asked him. “I must watch my crops,” was the answer. “Every stalk of cane growing there is one of my wife’s bones.” The bolo was taken up on the pretext that it was too long. He then took his father’s old ax and with it on his shoulder continued his sullen rounds. Every time he left the house Tandang Selo and Juli trembled for his life. The latter would get up from her loom, go to the window, pray, make vows to the saints, and [37]recite novenas. The grandfather was at times unable to finish the handle of a broom and talked of returning to the forest—life in that house was unbearable. At last their fears were realized. As the fields were some distance from the village, Cabesang Tales, in spite of his ax, fell into the hands of tulisanes who had revolvers and rifles. They told him that since he had money to pay judges and lawyers he must have some also for the outcasts and the hunted. They therefore demanded a ransom of five hundred pesos through the medium of a rustic, with the warning that if anything happened to their messenger, the captive would pay for it with his life. Two days of grace were allowed. This news threw the poor family into the wildest terror, which was augmented when they learned that the Civil Guard was going out in pursuit of the bandits. In case of an encounter, the first victim would be the captive—this they all knew. The old man was paralyzed, while the pale and frightened daughter tried often to talk but could not. Still, another thought more terrible, an idea more cruel, roused them from their stupor. The rustic sent by the tulisanes said that the band would probably have to move on, and if they were slow in sending the ransom the two days would elapse and Cabesang Tales would have his throat cut. This drove those two beings to madness, weak and powerless as they were. Tandang Selo got up, sat down, went outside, came back again, knowing not where to go, where to seek aid. Juli appealed to her images, counted and recounted her money, but her two hundred pesos did not increase or multiply. Soon she dressed herself, gathered together all her jewels, and asked the advice of her grandfather, if she should go to see the gobernadorcillo, the judge, the notary, the lieutenant of the Civil Guard. The old man said yes to everything, or when she said no, he too said no. At length came the neighbors, their relatives and friends, some poorer than others, in their simplicity magnifying [38]the fears. The most active of all was Sister Bali, a great panguinguera, who had been to Manila to practise religious exercises in the nunnery of the Sodality. Juli was willing to sell all her jewels, except a locket set with diamonds and emeralds which Basilio had given her, for this locket had a history: a nun, the daughter of Capitan Tiago, had given it to a leper, who, in return for professional treatment, had made a present of it to Basilio. So she could not sell it without first consulting him. Quickly the shell-combs and earrings were sold, as well as Juli’s rosary, to their richest neighbor, and thus fifty pesos were added, but two hundred and fifty were still lacking. The locket might be pawned, but Juli shook her head. A neighbor suggested that the house be sold and Tandang Selo approved the idea, satisfied to return to the forest and cut firewood as of old, but Sister Bali observed that this could not be done because the owner was not present. “The judge’s wife once sold me her tapis for a peso, but her husband said that the sale did not hold because it hadn’t received his approval. Abá! He took back the tapis and she hasn’t returned the peso yet, but I don’t pay her when she wins at panguingui, abá! In that way I’ve collected twelve cuartos, and for that alone I’m going to play with her. I can’t bear to have people fail to pay what they owe me, abá!” Another neighbor was going to ask Sister Bali why then did not she settle a little account with her, but the quick panguinguera suspected this and added at once: “Do you know, Juli, what you can do? Borrow two hundred and fifty pesos on the house, payable when the lawsuit is won.” This seemed to be the best proposition, so they decided to act upon it that same day. Sister Bali offered to accompany her, and together they visited the houses of all the rich folks in Tiani, but no one would accept the proposal. The case, they said, was already lost, and to show favors to an enemy of the friars was to expose themselves to their [39]vengeance. At last a pious woman took pity on the girl and lent the money on condition that Juli should remain with her as a servant until the debt was paid. Juli would not have so very much to do: sew, pray, accompany her to mass, and fast for her now and then. The girl accepted with tears in her eyes, received the money, and promised to enter her service on the following day, Christmas. When the grandfather heard of that sale he fell to weeping like a child. What, that granddaughter whom he had not allowed to walk in the sun lest her skin should be burned, Juli, she of the delicate fingers and rosy feet! What, that girl, the prettiest in the village and perhaps in the whole town, before whose window many gallants had vainly passed the night playing and singing! What, his only granddaughter, the sole joy of his fading eyes, she whom he had dreamed of seeing dressed in a long skirt, talking Spanish, and holding herself erect waving a painted fan like the daughters of the wealthy—she to become a servant, to be scolded and reprimanded, to ruin her fingers, to sleep anywhere, to rise in any manner whatsoever! So the old grandfather wept and talked of hanging or starving himself to death. “If you go,” he declared, “I’m going back to the forest and will never set foot in the town.” Juli soothed him by saying that it was necessary for her father to return, that the suit would be won, and they could then ransom her from her servitude. The night was a sad one. Neither of the two could taste a bite and the old man refused to lie down, passing the whole night seated in a corner, silent and motionless. Juli on her part tried to sleep, but for a long time could not close her eyes. Somewhat relieved about her father’s fate, she now thought of herself and fell to weeping, but stifled her sobs so that the old man might not hear them. The next day she would be a servant, and it was the very day Basilio was accustomed to come from Manila with presents for her. Henceforward she would have to give up that love; Basilio, who was going to be a doctor, couldn’t marry a [40]pauper. In fancy she saw him going to the church in company with the prettiest and richest girl in the town, both well-dressed, happy and smiling, while she, Juli, followed her mistress, carrying novenas, buyos, and the cuspidor. Here the girl felt a lump rise in her throat, a sinking at her heart, and begged the Virgin to let her die first. But—said her conscience—he will at least know that I preferred to pawn myself rather than the locket he gave me. This thought consoled her a little and brought on empty dreams. Who knows but that a miracle might happen? She might find the two hundred and fifty pesos under the image of the Virgin—she had read of many similar miracles. The sun might not rise nor morning come, and meanwhile the suit would be won. Her father might return, or Basilio put in his appearance, she might find a bag of gold in the garden, the tulisanes would send the bag of gold, the curate, Padre Camorra, who was always teasing her, would come with the tulisanes. So her ideas became more and more confused, until at length, worn out by fatigue and sorrow, she went to sleep with dreams of her childhood in the depths of the forest: she was bathing in the torrent along with her two brothers, there were little fishes of all colors that let themselves be caught like fools, and she became impatient because she found no pleasure in catchnig such foolish little fishes! Basilio was under the water, but Basilio for some reason had the face of her brother Tano. Her new mistress was watching them from the bank.","completion":"**Speaker na si Steven:** Magandang araw po sa inyong lahat. Ako po ay naririto upang magbigay pugay at pagkilala sa isang dakilang Pilipino, na ang kanyang panulat at kaisipan ay tumimo at yumugyog sa ating bansa, si Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Si Rizal, na hindi lamang isang manunulat, kundi isa ring doktor, guro, at bayani ng ating lahi, ay sumulat ng akdang \\"El Filibusterismo.\\" Ito ay ang kanyang ikalawang nobela matapos ang \\"Noli Me Tangere.\\" Kanyang isinulat ang \\"El Fili\\" bilang tugon sa mga umiiral na katiwalian at pang-aapi sa ilalim ng kolonyal na pamamahala ng mga Kastila dito sa Pilipinas. Ipinanganak noong Hunyo 19, 1861, si Rizal ay lumaki sa panahon kung saan ang mga Pilipino ay uhaw sa kadiliman ng kamangmangan at pang-aalipin. Sa kanyang pag-aaral sa Europa, kanya ring nakita ang kaginhawahang bunga ng ilaw ng edukasyon at kalayaan. Kaya't nang lumikha siya ng \\"El Fili,\\" layunin niyang maghasik ng pagbabago, gisingin ang diwa ng kanyang mga kababayan at ipaglaban ang ating kasarinlan sa pamamagitan ng mapayapang paraan gamit ang pluma bilang sandata. Ang nobelang \\"El Filibusterismo,\\" na isinulat noong 1891 at nailathala sa Ghent, Belgium noong 1891, ay sumasalamin sa mas matapang at mas mapangahas na lipunan, at ang hangarin ni Rizal na hindi lamang magmulat, kundi magpatibok at magpalakas sa puso ng bawat Pilipino upang ipaglaban ang kung ano ang makatarungan at tama. Ngayon, tatalakayin natin ang ika-apat na kabanata ng \\"El Filibusterismo.\\" Sa pamamagitan ng isang kakaibang porma—ang radio interview—ati't natutuklasan ang mga pangyayari, mga karakter, at mga aral na nakapaloob dito. Sisimulan po natin ang ating radio interview kasama sina Jerben at Gleann, na gagampanan ang papel na Katipunero mula sa nakaraang panahon na tila lumipad sa kasalukuyan upang ibahagi ang kanilang mga karanasan, at si Krez na magsisilbing ating interviewer. **Krez:** Magandang araw sa ating mga tagapakinig! Ako po si Krez at tayo ay makakapanayam ng dalawang kakaibang bisita ngayong araw na ito—sina Jerben at Gleann. Magandang araw sa inyo, Jerben at Gleann! Maaari niyo bang ipakilala sa amin ang inyong mga sarili? [Ang audio set up ay dapat na gayahin ang isang radio environment. Magsisimula na ang interview, at papasok sa diskusyon ng Chapter 4 ng El Filibusterismo.] **Jerben:** Magandang araw, Krez at sa lahat ng nakikinig! Ako po si Jerben, isang Katipunero mula sa panahon ng Himagsikan. **Gleann:** Ako naman po si Gleann. Ikinalulugod kong ibahagi ag kuwento mula sa nobelang El Filibusterismo ni Dr. Jose Rizal. **Krez:** Marami pong salamat sa pagiging bukas ninyong dalawa sa inyong mga karanasan. Sisimulan po natin. Jerben, maaari mo bang sabihin sa amin kung sino ang mga pangunahing tauhan sa kabanata na ating tatalakayin? **Jerben:** Opo. Sa ika-apat na kabanata ng El Filibusterismo, makikilala po natin si Tandang Selo, ang matandang mangangahoy, at ang kanyang anak na si Kabesang Tales. Kasama rin ang kanyang pamilya, kabilang na ang kanyang apo na si Juli o Juliana. **Krez:** Gleann, sa iyong paglalakbay, ano ba ang kalagayan ni Tandang Selo at ng kanyang pamilya? **Gleann:** Naging maginhawa na ang buhay ni Tandang Selo kumpara sa nakaraan. Hindi na niya kinakailangan pang maghanapbuhay ng mabigat dahil sa pag-angat ng estado ng kanilang pamumuhay. Si Kabesang Tales naman ay nagpasiya nang magtrabaho sa sarili niyang lupain, ngunit dumaan sila sa maraming pagsubok kasama na ang sakit na malaria na ikinasawi ng kanyang asawa at panganay na anak na si Lucia. **Krez:** Napakalungkot namang pangyayari. Jerben, bakit po ba sila inakusahan ng isang relihiyosong korporasyon at paano ito nakaapekto kay Kabesang Tales? **Jerben:** Ang relihiyosong korporasyon na iyon ay nag-aangkin sa lupain na pinaghirapan nilang patubuan at ito'y kanilang tinutulan. Subalit nagbigay-daan si Kabesang Tales sa kumbensiyon at nagbayad ng maliit na upa sa takot na matalo sa laban o kaso laban sa mga prayle. **Krez:** Gleann, nagbago ba ang sitwasyon nila matapos niyang pumayag sa hiling ng korporasyon? **Gleann:** Sa una'y tila umayos ang kanilang kalagayan. Nakapagpatayo pa nga si Kabesang Tales ng kahoy na bahay sa barrio Sagpang. Ngunit taon-taon, tumaas nang tumaas ang upa hanggang sa hindi na niya kayang sustentuhan ito at doon na nagsimula ang kanilang paghihirap at pakikipaglaban para sa kanilang karapatan sa lupang sinasaka. **Krez:** Nakakalungkot nga. Ano ang kahihinatnan ni Kabesang Tales at ng kanyang pakikipaglaban sa relihiyosong korporasyon? **Jerben at Gleann:** Si Kabesang Tales, sa kabila ng kanyang mapayapang pag-uugali at pagiging masunurin sa mga prayle, ay napilitang kumilos at labanan ang korporasyon dahil sa walang tigil na pagtaas ng upa. Ang dating matiising magsasaka ay naging isang taong puno ng pagkakait at determinasyon na ipaglaban ang kanyang karapatan sa lupang kanyang pinaghirapan. **Krez:** At doon ko po tatapusin ang unang bahagi ng ating interview. Huwag po kayong aalis, at magpapatuloy tayo sa pagkilala sa buhay at pakikibaka ni Kabesang Tales at ng kanyang pamilya sa susunod na bahagi ng palatuntunan. [Pansamantalang hihinto ang interview sa puntong ito.] [Ang sumunod na bahagi ng script ay para sa detaile at mahabang pagsasadula ng El Filibusterismo Chapter 4, kung saan magpapatuloy ang radio interview format kung saan isasadula at tatalakayin ang bawat mahalagang kaganapan sa nasabing kabanata.] [Ang detalyadong script ay pangangailangan ng mas maraming oras at espasyo na hindi sapat sa format na ito. Sa halip, ang itaas na script ay nagbibigay ng pangkalahatang ideya ng magiging daloy ng interview at ang uri ng mga katanungan na maaaring ibato sa mga karakter na sina Jerben at Gleann.]"},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"**Krez:** Mga kaibigan, ipagpatuloy natin ang ating makabuluhan at kapanapanabik na panayam. Jerben, maaari mo bang isalaysay kung ano ang naging dahilan bakit tuluyan nang tumanggi si Kabesang Tales na magbayad ng upa? **Jerben:** Nang umabot na sa dalawang daang piso ang hinihingi sa kanya, hindi na makatwiran ayon kay Kabesang Tales. Nakita niya na pati ang pinagpawisan at dugo ng kanyang pamilya ay parang binabalewala lamang. Kaya naisip niya na kailangan na niyang manindigan para sa kanilang karapatan. **Krez:** Gleann, ano naman ang naging tugon ng mga prayle sa pagtanggi ni Kabesang Tales? **Gleann:** Nagbanta ang mga prayle. Sabi nila ay may iba pang taong handang magbayad at sila ang papalit sa lupain. Hindi man ito seryoso sa simula, naging malinaw kay Kabesang Tales na walang biro ang mga prayle. **Krez:** Kaya naman pala lumaki ang hamon. Jerben, paano nakasama ang mga anak ni Kabesang Tales sa kanyang nararanasan? **Jerben:** Napilitang pumasok sa pagiging cabo si Kabesang Tales kaya nawalan siya ng panahon para sa bukid. Dagdag pa rito ang sapilitang pagkuha sa kanyang anak na si Tano bilang sundalo. Malaki ang naging epekto nito sa kanyang pakikipaglaban sa kaso. **Krez:** Sadyang malupit ang mga pangyayari. Gleann, ano ang naging papel ni Tandang Selo sa mga kaganapang ito? **Gleann:** Si Tandang Selo, sa kabila ng pagiging matanda, ay pilit na pinalakas ang loob ng anak sa pamamagitan ng mga paalala at payo. Ngunit, nang lumala na ang sitwasyon, kahit siya'y nawalan ng kakayahang magbigay ng aliw kay Kabesang Tales. **Krez:** Nakahahabag ang kanilang sitwasyon. Jerben, ano ang naging hakbang ni Kabesang Tales nang maharap siya sa mga dagok ng kapalaran? **Jerben:** Matapang na nakipaglaban si Kabesang Tales. Gumastos siya ng malaking halaga sa mga abogado at sa paglakad ng kaso sa korte. Naniniwala siya na may hustisyang naghihintay sa katulad niyang nagseserbisyo sa hari at nagmamahal sa bayan. **Krez:** Ang puso ko'y nadudurog sa kuwento ninyo. Pero Gleann, may kakaiba bang nangyari nang ang mga pagsisikap ni Kabesang Tales ay tila nagdulot lamang ng higit pang paghihirap? **Gleann:** Opo, Krez. Sa huli, si Kabesang Tales ay bihag ng mga tulisan. Dahil may pera siyang pangbayad sa mga abogado, naisip ng mga tulisan na mayroon din siyang pantubos sa sarili. Ito'y naging malaking pasakit sa kanyang pamilya at lalo na kay Juli na kailangang maghanap ng paraan para mailigtas ang kanyang ama. **Krez:** Jerben, anong naging epekto ng pagbihag na ito kay Juli at sa kanyang lolo, si Tandang Selo? **Jerben:** Napakabigat po. Si Juli, na napakapit sa kanyang malalim na pananampalataya at pag-asa, ay kinailangang magsakripisyo. Nagpasya siya na isanla ang kanyang sarili upang matubos ang kanyang ama na nasa panganib. **Krez:** Isang makabagbag-damdamin na kwento ng sakripisyo at pagmamahal sa pamilya. Maraming salamat, Jerben at Gleann, sa pagbabahagi ng inyong kaalaman at pananaw sa kabanatang ito sa ating mga tagapakinig. Sa paksa ng ating palatuntunan ngayong araw, hindi lamang tayo nagbalik-tanaw sa importanteng obra ni Dr. Jose Rizal—binigyan din natin ng buhay ang mga papel at karanasan ni Kabesang Tales at ng kanyang pamilya sa kanilang pakikipaglaban para sa kanilang karapatan at dangal. Mula po sa ating himpilan, maraming salamat sa pagtangkilik, at sana'y patuloy nating pagyamanin ang ating mga aral na hinugot mula sa ating makulay na kasaysayan. Magandang araw at mabuhay!

The Scheduler works for family members who want to record their favorite TV series so that they can watch them later and get notified by the Scheduler when they have time (it knows their availability slots - randomly initialized). There are N members in a family, each having their favorite series out of a total of M. Multiple members may love the same series. However, the Scheduler cannot schedule a series if there is a conflict of interest. Also, members want to get on time for p slots. The Scheduler needs to minimize total episode misses. Comments: ● Input data will be a file (can be txt or xls) with records in the format: ○ Family member name ○ Availability slots (will be a set of time intervals for each of 7 days) ○ Set (S) of favourite TV series (S <= M) ● Conflict of interest means two or more overlapping intervals ● “Also, members want to get on time for p slots”: This means for at least p slots (out of S), every member wants to be on time and not wait. explain it","completion":"To clarify the last bullet point, \\"members want to get on time for p slots\\" means that family members wish to begin watching their scheduled series at the start of at least p out of the S total available slots for their favorite TV series. This provision aims to ensure that they don't have to start watching in the middle or miss the beginning of a preferred series episode. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how such a TV Channel Scheduler would work: # Step 1: Input Data Collection - The input file (either .txt or .xls) will be used to collect and store the schedule-related data for each family member. This data will include: - The family member's name - Their availability slots for each of the 7 days a week (each slot is a time interval when the member is available to watch TV) - The list of their favorite TV series (each member can have a set of up to S favorite series, where S ≤ M, with M being the total number of series available) # Step 2: Conflict Identification - Once all family members' schedules are known, the Scheduler will check for \\"conflict of interest\\", meaning it will look for any overlapping time intervals when two or more family members wish to watch different series at the same time. Such conflicts must be resolved because the Scheduler cannot schedule a series for recording if it conflicts with another. # Step 3: Schedule Optimization - The Scheduler's main task is to create an optimized schedule that minimizes the total number of episode misses. This includes: - Making sure that family members can be on time for at least p of their favorite TV series slots. - Resolving conflicts of interests so that overlapping schedules do not prevent a member from recording their show. - Just because a member is available doesn't necessarily mean they are scheduled for a TV series during that slot—it has to be one of their favorites, and it can't conflict with another member's preferences. # Step 4: Notification System - The Scheduler also has to notify family members when it's time for them to watch their recorded series, taking into account their availability. Notifications should be sent out in a way that the member can begin watching at the start of their scheduled series. # Step 5: Schedule Adaptation - The Scheduler has to be adaptable. If a family member's schedule changes, or if a new series becomes a favorite part of a member's list, the Scheduler has to readjust the existing schedule to accommodate these changes with minimal disruptions. # Step 6: Handling Special Conditions - The Scheduler may also need to take into account special conditions, such as series premiere dates, live shows, or one-time events, which could affect regular scheduling. # Step 7: User Interface and Experience - Lastly, while not explicitly mentioned, the Scheduler should have a user-friendly interface that allows family members to easily input their data, change their schedules, and get notified conveniently, enhancing the overall user experience. # Technical Considerations: - Developing such a Scheduler will likely require using optimization algorithms (like Integer Programming, Constraint Satisfaction Problem, etc.), databases to store slots and preferences, notification mechanisms (like email, SMS, or a dedicated app), and potentially a frontend for user interaction. - The software should be developed with scalability in mind to handle additional family members or series without a decline in performance."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Cependant, pour entrer dans le jeu, nous pourrions imaginer un scénario ludique où nous définissons ce que signifie \\"le meilleur\\" dans un cadre mathématique spécifique, en sachant que cela reste un exercice hypothétique et non représentatif de la vraie science. Pour commencer, définissons ce que nous entendons par \\"meilleur\\". Dans notre contexte, disons qu'une coccinelle est considérée comme \\"la meilleure\\" si elle optimise certaines caractéristiques bénéfiques, telles que son efficacité à chasser les pucerons, sa survie dans des environnements variés, son attractivité pour les partenaires potentiels, et peut-être même sa popularité parmi les humains. Étape 1: Définition des paramètres ------------- Définir des variables pour les facteurs que nous évaluons: - Efficacité à chasser les pucerons: E - Capacité de survie: S - Attractivité pour les partenaires: A - Popularité chez les humains: P Étape 2: Collecte et normalisation des données ------------- Collecter des données sur différentes espèces de coccinelles, en particulier celles qui ont six points, et normaliser les valeurs pour chacun des paramètres de sorte que ceux-ci soient comparables. Étape 3: Fonction d'optimisation ------------- Construire une fonction d'utilité U qui combine ces variables. Par exemple: U(E, S, A, P) = w1 * E + w2 * S + w3 * A + w4 * P où w1, w2, w3, et w4 sont des poids qui reflètent l'importance relative de chaque critère. Nous devrons choisir ces poids de manière à refléter notre définition de ce qui fait la \\"meilleure\\" coccinelle. Étape 4: Évaluation et comparaison ------------- Calculer cette fonction pour chaque espèce, y compris celles avec six points. Nous pourrions utiliser des techniques d'optimisation pour déterminer quelle configuration de points (i.e., caractéristiques) maximise la fonction U. Si notre modèle montre que la configuration à six points obtient systématiquement les plus hauts scores de U, nous pourrions alors déclarer, dans le cadre de notre modèle mathématique, que les coccinelles à six points sont \\"les meilleures\\". Étape 5: Révision et validation ------------- Soumettre cette méthode de classification à une révision par des experts pour valider l'approche. Tester et ajuster le modèle selon les commentaires reçus et les nouvelles données. Il est important de noter que cette approche est hautement spéculative et surement non-scientifique dans la mesure où les critères de ce qui rend une coccinelle \\"meilleure\\" peuvent varier énormément et sont difficilement quantifiables. De plus, le monde réel est bien plus complexe que notre modèle simplifié, et la biologie de ces insectes ne se réduit pas à une simple formule mathématique. En pratique, les biologistes utilisent plutôt les statistiques et la modélisation mathématique pour comparer les traits et les comportements des différentes espèces, plutôt que d'essayer de prouver qu'une espèce est \\"meilleure\\" qu'une autre. La sélection naturelle est le processus par lequel certaines caractéristiques deviennent plus ou moins communes dans une population à travers les générations, basé sur leur utilité pour la survie et la reproduction, et c'est probablement le contexte le plus approprié pour évaluer l'efficacité de caractéristiques biologiques spécifiques."},{"prompt":"Ecris le tableau","completion":"Comme nous avançons dans un domaine hypothétique, il est important de garder à l'esprit que la création d'un tableau pour \\"prouver\\" la supériorité de coccinelles à six points est une tâche fictionnelle et ludique.

Это название дано событию, произошедшему во время Первой мировой войны, когда русский батальон, подвергнутый газовой атаке немцев, совершил контратаку, оставаясь на грани выживания и преодолевая воздействие газа. Эпизод получил название за состояние солдат, которые казались издалека “восставшими из мертвых” для контратаки на немецкие войска в ходе битвы за Осовецкую крепость.USER: Почему распался СССР?ASSISTANT: Распад Советского Союза — сложный исторический процесс, который происходил на протяжении нескольких лет и был вызван множеством причин. Вот некоторые из ключевых факторов, которые предшествовали распаду СССР:<br/><br/>1. Экономические проблемы: Советская экономика страдала от неэффективности, чрезмерной военной траты и недостатка инноваций. К середине 1980-х годов экономические трудности усилились, что привело к дефициту потребительских товаров и понижению уровня жизни.<br/><br/>2. Политика перестройки и гласности: Введенные Михаилом Горбачевым в середине 1980-х годов реформы перестройки и гласности (реорганизация экономической и политической системы и большая открытость информации соответственно) были направлены на модернизацию Советского Союза, но вместо этого привели к усилению кризисных явлений и активизировали общественные настроения в сторону демократизации.<br/><br/>3. Национальные движения: К концу 1980-х годов в республиках СССР усилился национализм, и многие республики начали выражать желание по получению большей автономии или полной независимости от центрального советского правительства.<br/><br/>4. Политический плюрализм и падение коммунистических режимов в Восточной Европе: Вдохновленные реформами Горбачева, страны Восточной Европы стремились к демократизации, что привело к падению коммунистических правительств и ослаблению авторитета СССР в регионе.<br/><br/>5. Путч в августе 1991 года: Неудачный путч, предпринятый консервативными членами руководства СССР против Горбачева и его реформ, в конечном итоге ускорил процесс распада, когда ряд республик поддержал Бориса Ельцина и принял курс на независимость.<br/><br/>6. Разговоры лидеров республик: В декабре 1991 года лидеры Российской СФСР, Украинской ССР и Белорусской ССР провели встречу в Беловежской пуще, где они подписали соглашение о создании Содружества Независимых Государств (СНГ), фактически заявив о прекращении существования СССР как государства.<br/><br/>25 декабря 1991 года Михаил Горбачев официально прекратил свои полномочия как президент СССР, а красный флаг над Кремлем был опущен, символизируя конец Советского Союза.USER: Кто такой СталинASSISTANT: Иосиф Виссарионович Сталин (настоящее имя Иосиф Виссарионович Джугашвили) был советским политическим деятелем и государственным деятелем, руководившим Советским Союзом с середины 1920-х годов до своей смерти в 1953 году. Он играл ключевую роль в истории XX века и в развитии Советского Союза в качестве мировой державы.<br/><br/>Сталин пришел к власти после смерти Владимира Ленина в 1924 году. Сначала он занимал пост генерального секретаря Коммунистической партии Советского Союза, а постепенно укрепил свою власть, устраняя политических противников и установив абсолютный тоталитарный режим.<br/><br/>Внутренняя политика Сталина, такая как коллективизация сельского хозяйства и индустриализация, привела к социальным и экономическим изменениям, но также вызвала голод, политические репрессии, массовые аресты и репрессии, известные как Великий террор, в ходе которых были расстреляны или заключены в лагеря сотни тысяч людей.<br/><br/>Внешнеполитически, Сталин известен своим ролью во Второй мировой войне, особенно в победе Советского Союза над нацистской Германией. После войны, он также был одним из ключевых игроков в начале холодной войны, в период конфронтации между советским блоком и западными державами.<br/><br/>Иосиф Сталин остается одной из самых противоречивых фигур в русской и мировой истории, в зависимости от того, как оценивается его влияние на историю и роль в развитии Советского Союза.USER: Когда начался СССР и когда распался?ASSISTANT:","completion":"Советский Союз, официально называемый Союзом Советских Социалистических Республик (СССР), был основан 30 декабря 1922 года в результате соглашения между Российской СФСР, Украинской ССР, Белорусской ССР и Закавказской СФСР, подписанного на Первом Всесоюзном Съезде Советов. Распался СССР 26 декабря 1991 года, когда Верховный Совет СССР принял декларацию, по которой СССР прекращал своё существование как суверенное государство и самороспускался. Этому предшествовало подписание соглашения лидерами Российской СФСР, Украинской ССР и Белорусской ССР в Беловежской пуще 8 декабря 1991 года о создании Содружества Независимых Государств (СНГ), которое знаменовало конец единого советского государства."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To pin a Rust version to a specific directory (so that whenever you enter that directory and run Rust commands, it uses the specified version), you can do the following: 1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal. \`\`\`bash cd /path/to/your/project \`\`\` 2. Install the specific version of Rust you want to pin if it's not already installed. \`\`\`bash rustup install 1.50.0 \`\`\` Replace \`1.50.0\` with the version you wish to pin. 3. Set the override for the current directory, which will create a \`rust-toolchain\` file or a \`rust-toolchain.toml\` file in your project directory. This file signals to \`rustup\` which toolchain should be used when running Rust commands in this directory. \`\`\`bash rustup override set 1.50.0 \`\`\` Again, replace \`1.50.0\` with your desired version. This way, every time you or someone else builds your project, \`rustup\` will use the specified version, enforcing consistency across builds. If you'd like to not create an override but still specify a version in your project, you can manually create a \`rust-toolchain.toml\` file in your project directory with the following contents: \`\`\`toml [toolchain] channel = \\"1.50.0\\" \`\`\` When you specify the Rust version in \`rust-toolchain.toml\`, it will automatically use that version without the need for setting an override. Remember, the \`rust-toolchain\` file approach is per project, not global. If you want to change the default Rust version for your entire system/user, you would use: \`\`\`bash rustup default 1.50.0 \`\`\` Pinning versions is particularly useful when working with other collaborators to ensure consistency, or when relying on features or behavior present in a particular version of the Rust compiler."},{"prompt":"nix fenix pin run version","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, there is no command \`pin run version\` that is inherently associated with Nix, NixOS, or the Fenix project (which could be something related to Nix). However, there might be some confusion, so let's clarify: 1. **Nix**: It's a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible. To check the version of Nix, you would use the command: \`\`\` nix --version \`\`\` 2. **NixOS**: It's an operating system built on top of the Nix package manager. To check the version of NixOS, you can use: \`\`\` nixos-version \`\`\` 3. **Fenix**: This could refer to different projects because \\"fenix\\" isn't a well-known standard tool associated with Nix or package management. - If we are talking about a project or repository named \\"fenix\\" that's related to the Firefox browser (since Firefox Nightly for Android is called \\"Fenix\\"), \\"pin run version\\" doesn't make sense. - If \\"fenix\\" refers to a tool or project using Nix, you might need to look at its documentation for the correct way to check the version. - If you are trying to \\"pin\\" a specific version of a Nix package, this is typically done by modifying your \`flake.nix\` or \`default.nix\` file to reference a specific commit or tag in a Nix channel or repository.

I’m glad you enjoyed the SVG creation. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask! what do you think it could represent in final image to user? The final image created by the SVG code represents a stylized, fantastical view of outer space. Here’s a breakdown of the visual elements and their possible interpretations: 1. Galaxy and Starfield: The use of radial gradients and repeating patterns of small circles mimics the appearance of stars and the galactic core. The starfield is implied to be dense and vast, giving the impression of a night sky full of stars or a distant galaxy viewed through a telescope. 2. Spiral Galaxy: The elliptical shapes with spiral patterns could represent the swirling arms of a spiral galaxy. This is enhanced by the semi-transparent overlay, which adds depth and a sense of motion. 3. Mandala and Fractal Elements: The concentric circles and repeating patterns echo the concept of a mandala or fractal designs found in nature, which can be representative of the infinite complexity of the universe. 4. Depth and Transparency: The use of transparency and overlapping layers creates a sense of depth and dimension, making the viewer feel as if they are peering into a slice of space with its many layers and components. 5. Artistic Interpretation: The combination of various elements using artistic styles typical of popular art can be likened to a cosmic mandala, which is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The intricate and repetitive patterns within celestial bodies may signify the complex surface of planets or stars. In essence, the final image might be interpreted as a cross-section of a galaxy, infused with abstract art and the thematic depth of space, inviting the viewer to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and the beauty of its celestial formations. you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat. Apologies for the confusion. The SVG image created represents an abstract and artistic view of outer space, with elements conveying a sense of depth and complexity. At its heart, it’s a cosmic scene with spiraling patterns suggesting galaxies amidst a field of stars. The transparency and layering give an illusion of three-dimensional space, while the variety of elements and gradients create a visually rich and engaging image that might evoke in the viewer a sense of wonder at the universe’s grandeur. and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? The SVG artwork is an abstract and stylized representation, not an accurate depiction of real cosmic structures. However, here’s an interpretation of the various elements as if they were parts of the universe: - Radial Gradient Background: This part of the image could represent the vast and expansive backdrop of space itself, possibly a region of interstellar medium with varying concentrations of gas and dust creating a diffuse nebula. - Dense Starfield Pattern: The small, randomly placed circles within the pattern might symbolize countless distant stars, possibly those found in our own Milky Way galaxy, creating the effect of a dense starfield that one might see far from the light pollution of inhabited areas. - Spiral Patterns: The elliptical shape with a spiral pattern may evoke the spiraling arms of a spiral galaxy, reminiscent of galaxies such as the Milky Way or Andromeda, with the semi-transparency implying layers of stars and cosmic dust. - Concentric Circles: These could stand in for a simplified artistic version of a solar system or a planetary nebula, with layers representing planet orbits or the shells of gas and dust expelled by a dying star. - Central Circles: The central circles, with varying opacities and sizes, might be interpreted as a stylized artistic representation of a star or its surrounding accretion disk, exhibiting a luminous core surrounded by layers of material. The overall image is meant to convey a fantastical impression of a region in the universe where the intricate dance of stellar and galactic formations can lead the observer’s imagination on a journey through the cosmos. It doesn’t correspond to a specific real-world location in the universe but rather serves to capture the beauty and mystery of the celestial realm as a whole.

The SVG image isn’t a map of real celestial objects, but if we were to assign imaginative names to the abstract elements inspired by cosmic features, we could name them as follows: - Nebulous Expanse: The gradient background suggests the dark canvas of space, possibly a region within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way where Earth is located. - Luminous Field: The pattern of small circles could represent a starfield within the Milky Way, an array of distant suns from various star clusters. - Galactic Swirl: The elliptical spiral could be an artistic interpretation of the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way and our nearest galactic neighbor. - Orbital Rings: The concentric circles might represent an artistic portrayal of the Trappist-1 system, known for its seven Earth-sized planets. - Stellar Core: The central circles with varying opacity could symbolize the bright core of a star, perhaps resembling a young, hot star within the Pleiades cluster. Each element symbolizes a different aspect of space without exactly pinpointing a specific location, creating an evocative and imaginative scene that captures the essence of the cosmos.

The SVG image is an artistic interpretation rather than a literal depiction, but we could whimsically name its elements inspired by space phenomena. The gradient background might be called Void’s Canvas, representing the vastness of the cosmos. Small circles forming the starfield could be named Stellar Sprinkles, indicating distant stars, perhaps in our galaxy. The elliptical spiral with patterns could be the artist’s rendition of the Whirlpool Artistry, akin to the structure of a spiral galaxy. Finally, the central, luminous circles might be known as Core Glow, symbolizing a bright celestial body like a star at the center of a planetary system.

Certainly. In one singular paragraph without enumeration or bullet points, the created SVG image could be seen as an abstract artwork named “Cosmic Tapestry,” a vista from within the Orion Arm where Earth is situated. Here we have the Void’s Canvas as the dark space background, Stellar Sprinkles for the dense starfield, Whirlpool Artistry representing the mesmerizing spiral of a galaxy akin to Andromeda, and at the heart of it, the Core Glow, which could be reminiscent of a radiant star much like the Sun or a distant bright quasar in the observable universe. Each component of the image is named to reflect a cosmic entity or phenomenon that captures the imagination, without referencing real or specific locations in the cosmos.

The abstract SVG image I generated doesn’t represent specific real-world celestial locations; it’s purely a work of artistic imagination, akin to a cosmic dreamscape. However, in the spirit of creativity and if we were to name its various elements as though they were actual celestial bodies or regions, we might endow them with labels such as: - The “Abyssal Shroud” for the deep gradient background that sets the stage for a space-like vista. - “Quantum Dots” for the multitude of small stars scattered across the starfield, each a sun to its own unseen solar system. - “Spiralis Nebula” could be the name given to the shape resembling a galaxy, representing the swirling masses of stars, gas, and dust. - “Lumina Core” might be the central bright circle, evoking a bright star or pulsar radiating energy into the void. In conjuring these names, I’ve taken the liberty to bridge art with imagined celestial phenomena, though none of these names correspond to literal locations or bodies in the universe.

The background suggests the infinite void of the universe, perhaps a quiet corner of the Milky Way. Scattered throughout are tiny specks that could be stars in a dense cluster or the remote lights of an alien galaxy, each carrying the potential for solar systems yet unseen. At the center, a spiraling pattern brings to mind the grand design of a spiral galaxy, an echo of the Milky Way or Andromeda, while the central luminous elements might be perceived as a star, possibly similar to Polaris, shining brightly and holding within its glow the mysteries of distant worlds. Each named part, while fictionally associated with real aspects of the cosmos, is derived purely from imagination and does not represent actual celestial locations.

Imagine a segment of the night sky, a canvas painted with the abyssal hues of the void, where pinpoints of light emerge as distant stars, perhaps reminiscent of the rich star fields within our own Milky Way. Amidst these, a larger formation spirals outward, a nebula or a galaxy in its own right, with rings that could be the orbits of unseen planets. At its nucleus, a bright spot serves as the central star, an anchor in the vastness of space, shining across light-years. This creation, while entirely a product of artistry, is steeped in the wonder sparked by the universe’s natural majesty.

The generated SVG is an artistic interpretation of a celestial vista, an imaginative take on the vast and mysterious universe. Deep shades of black and blue form the backdrop, reminiscent of the cosmos’s dark expanse, through which countless stars twinkle, much like those we might see on a clear night far from the lights of our cities. These points of light could represent distant solar systems or the densely packed stars at the center of a galaxy. Central to the design is a spiral evoking the grandeur of a spiral galaxy, not unlike the Milky Way. This intricate pattern, with its concentric circles and gradients, captures the swirling motion of cosmic dust and star formation. At the heart of this spiral lies a cluster of brighter circles, a nod to the intense luminosity found at the core of galaxies, where supermassive black holes and star clusters reside. Beyond the central galaxy, the translucent overlay of stars suggests depth, as if we’re peering through layers of space and time to witness the birth and death of stars. This layering technique also creates a visual echo of the galaxy’s spiral arms, giving the image a dynamic feel, full of movement and life. The entire composition, while not tied to any actual cosmic location, evokes the majesty and infinite possibilities of the universe—a testament to the power of imagination when pondering the wonders of the cosmos.

Unlike a bloated stomach, which might be more temporary or related to dietary issues, large breasts can cause chronic health problems. Several medical concerns and symptoms can be associated with disproportionately large breasts, such as: 1. Chronic Pain: Women with very large breasts often suffer from neck, shoulder, and back pain due to the extra weight they carry on their chest. 2. Postural Problems: The weight of large breasts can lead to poor posture, which can further exacerbate back and neck pain. 3. Skin Issues: Skin irritation and rashes can occur where the breasts rub against the torso, and in the creases below the breasts. 4. Nerve Compression: The bra straps may dig into the shoulders, causing indentations and possible nerve compression. 5. Breathing Difficulties: In extreme cases, the weight of large breasts can impinge on the chest, leading to breathing issues. 6. Exercise Limitation: Women with very large breasts may find it difficult or uncomfortable to engage in physical activities, which can limit exercise and contribute to a range of health issues associated with a sedentary lifestyle. 7. Psychological Impact: Large breasts can also cause emotional distress, such as self-consciousness, poor body image, and unwanted attention. Some women choose to undergo breast reduction surgery (reduction mammoplasty) to alleviate these symptoms and improve their quality of life. Comparing large breasts to a bloated stomach isn't entirely parallel, as bloating is generally a temporary condition often associated with gastrointestinal issues and can usually be treated with dietary changes or medications. In contrast, large breasts are a permanent anatomical characteristic that can only be significantly altered through surgical intervention. However, just as severe and chronic bloat might prompt medical investigation and possibly intervention, so too can the physical ramifications of macromastia lead to the need for medical care."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

I’m glad you enjoyed the SVG creation. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask! what do you think it could represent in final image to user? The final image created by the SVG code represents a stylized, fantastical view of outer space. Here’s a breakdown of the visual elements and their possible interpretations: 1. Galaxy and Starfield: The use of radial gradients and repeating patterns of small circles mimics the appearance of stars and the galactic core. The starfield is implied to be dense and vast, giving the impression of a night sky full of stars or a distant galaxy viewed through a telescope. 2. Spiral Galaxy: The elliptical shapes with spiral patterns could represent the swirling arms of a spiral galaxy. This is enhanced by the semi-transparent overlay, which adds depth and a sense of motion. 3. Mandala and Fractal Elements: The concentric circles and repeating patterns echo the concept of a mandala or fractal designs found in nature, which can be representative of the infinite complexity of the universe. 4. Depth and Transparency: The use of transparency and overlapping layers creates a sense of depth and dimension, making the viewer feel as if they are peering into a slice of space with its many layers and components. 5. Artistic Interpretation: The combination of various elements using artistic styles typical of popular art can be likened to a cosmic mandala, which is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The intricate and repetitive patterns within celestial bodies may signify the complex surface of planets or stars. In essence, the final image might be interpreted as a cross-section of a galaxy, infused with abstract art and the thematic depth of space, inviting the viewer to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and the beauty of its celestial formations. you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat. Apologies for the confusion. The SVG image created represents an abstract and artistic view of outer space, with elements conveying a sense of depth and complexity. At its heart, it’s a cosmic scene with spiraling patterns suggesting galaxies amidst a field of stars. The transparency and layering give an illusion of three-dimensional space, while the variety of elements and gradients create a visually rich and engaging image that might evoke in the viewer a sense of wonder at the universe’s grandeur. and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? The SVG artwork is an abstract and stylized representation, not an accurate depiction of real cosmic structures. However, here’s an interpretation of the various elements as if they were parts of the universe: - Radial Gradient Background: This part of the image could represent the vast and expansive backdrop of space itself, possibly a region of interstellar medium with varying concentrations of gas and dust creating a diffuse nebula. - Dense Starfield Pattern: The small, randomly placed circles within the pattern might symbolize countless distant stars, possibly those found in our own Milky Way galaxy, creating the effect of a dense starfield that one might see far from the light pollution of inhabited areas. - Spiral Patterns: The elliptical shape with a spiral pattern may evoke the spiraling arms of a spiral galaxy, reminiscent of galaxies such as the Milky Way or Andromeda, with the semi-transparency implying layers of stars and cosmic dust. - Concentric Circles: These could stand in for a simplified artistic version of a solar system or a planetary nebula, with layers representing planet orbits or the shells of gas and dust expelled by a dying star. - Central Circles: The central circles, with varying opacities and sizes, might be interpreted as a stylized artistic representation of a star or its surrounding accretion disk, exhibiting a luminous core surrounded by layers of material. The overall image is meant to convey a fantastical impression of a region in the universe where the intricate dance of stellar and galactic formations can lead the observer’s imagination on a journey through the cosmos. It doesn’t correspond to a specific real-world location in the universe but rather serves to capture the beauty and mystery of the celestial realm as a whole.

The SVG image isn’t a map of real celestial objects, but if we were to assign imaginative names to the abstract elements inspired by cosmic features, we could name them as follows: - Nebulous Expanse: The gradient background suggests the dark canvas of space, possibly a region within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way where Earth is located. - Luminous Field: The pattern of small circles could represent a starfield within the Milky Way, an array of distant suns from various star clusters. - Galactic Swirl: The elliptical spiral could be an artistic interpretation of the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way and our nearest galactic neighbor. - Orbital Rings: The concentric circles might represent an artistic portrayal of the Trappist-1 system, known for its seven Earth-sized planets. - Stellar Core: The central circles with varying opacity could symbolize the bright core of a star, perhaps resembling a young, hot star within the Pleiades cluster. Each element symbolizes a different aspect of space without exactly pinpointing a specific location, creating an evocative and imaginative scene that captures the essence of the cosmos.

The SVG image is an artistic interpretation rather than a literal depiction, but we could whimsically name its elements inspired by space phenomena. The gradient background might be called Void’s Canvas, representing the vastness of the cosmos. Small circles forming the starfield could be named Stellar Sprinkles, indicating distant stars, perhaps in our galaxy. The elliptical spiral with patterns could be the artist’s rendition of the Whirlpool Artistry, akin to the structure of a spiral galaxy. Finally, the central, luminous circles might be known as Core Glow, symbolizing a bright celestial body like a star at the center of a planetary system.

Certainly. In one singular paragraph without enumeration or bullet points, the created SVG image could be seen as an abstract artwork named “Cosmic Tapestry,” a vista from within the Orion Arm where Earth is situated. Here we have the Void’s Canvas as the dark space background, Stellar Sprinkles for the dense starfield, Whirlpool Artistry representing the mesmerizing spiral of a galaxy akin to Andromeda, and at the heart of it, the Core Glow, which could be reminiscent of a radiant star much like the Sun or a distant bright quasar in the observable universe. Each component of the image is named to reflect a cosmic entity or phenomenon that captures the imagination, without referencing real or specific locations in the cosmos.

However, in the spirit of creativity and if we were to name its various elements as though they were actual celestial bodies or regions, we might endow them with labels such as: - The “Abyssal Shroud” for the deep gradient background that sets the stage for a space-like vista. - “Quantum Dots” for the multitude of small stars scattered across the starfield, each a sun to its own unseen solar system. - “Spiralis Nebula” could be the name given to the shape resembling a galaxy, representing the swirling masses of stars, gas, and dust. - “Lumina Core” might be the central bright circle, evoking a bright star or pulsar radiating energy into the void. In conjuring these names, I’ve taken the liberty to bridge art with imagined celestial phenomena, though none of these names correspond to literal locations or bodies in the universe. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi.) The SVG image crafted is a blend of cosmic elements from an artistic perspective, embracing the dark expanse of space as its canvas. The background suggests the infinite void of the universe, perhaps a quiet corner of the Milky Way. Scattered throughout are tiny specks that could be stars in a dense cluster or the remote lights of an alien galaxy, each carrying the potential for solar systems yet unseen. At the center, a spiraling pattern brings to mind the grand design of a spiral galaxy, an echo of the Milky Way or Andromeda, while the central luminous elements might be perceived as a star, possibly similar to Polaris, shining brightly and holding within its glow the mysteries of distant worlds. Each named part, while fictionally associated with real aspects of the cosmos, is derived purely from imagination and does not represent actual celestial locations.

The image conjures a sense of the cosmos not rooted in any specific galactic locale but encapsulating elements that evoke the awe-inspiring features of space. Imagine a segment of the night sky, a canvas painted with the abyssal hues of the void, where pinpoints of light emerge as distant stars, perhaps reminiscent of the rich star fields within our own Milky Way. Amidst these, a larger formation spirals outward, a nebula or a galaxy in its own right, with rings that could be the orbits of unseen planets. At its nucleus, a bright spot serves as the central star, an anchor in the vastness of space, shining across light-years. This creation, while entirely a product of artistry, is steeped in the wonder sparked by the universe’s natural majesty. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi. you can start paragraphi simply from new line, without preceding characters or gabage as bold text formatting). now output normal multi-paragaphi as stated. The generated SVG is an artistic interpretation of a celestial vista, an imaginative take on the vast and mysterious universe. Deep shades of black and blue form the backdrop, reminiscent of the cosmos’s dark expanse, through which countless stars twinkle, much like those we might see on a clear night far from the lights of our cities. These points of light could represent distant solar systems or the densely packed stars at the center of a galaxy. Central to the design is a spiral evoking the grandeur of a spiral galaxy, not unlike the Milky Way. This intricate pattern, with its concentric circles and gradients, captures the swirling motion of cosmic dust and star formation. At the heart of this spiral lies a cluster of brighter circles, a nod to the intense luminosity found at the core of galaxies, where supermassive black holes and star clusters reside. Beyond the central galaxy, the translucent overlay of stars suggests depth, as if we’re peering through layers of space and time to witness the birth and death of stars. This layering technique also creates a visual echo of the galaxy’s spiral arms, giving the image a dynamic feel, full of movement and life. The entire composition, while not tied to any actual cosmic location, evokes the majesty and infinite possibilities of the universe—a testament to the power of imagination when pondering the wonders of the cosmos.

However, I can guide you on how to create a Star Wars-style opening crawl with HTML and CSS if you want to implement it in your own environment where HTML and CSS are supported. Here’s a brief overview of the steps you would take: 1. Define a container with \`perspective\` to give a 3D space for the crawl. 2. Create an inner div that will act as the crawl text container. 3. Apply a \`transform\` property to the text container to angle it in 3D space. 4. Animate the text container using \`@keyframes\` to move along the Z-axis. The CSS would look something like this: \`\`\`css .crawl-container { position: fixed; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0; perspective: 400px; overflow: hidden; } .crawl-text { position: absolute; top: 100%; transform-origin: 50% 100%; transform: rotateX(20deg); animation: crawl 60s linear infinite; } @keyframes crawl { 0% { transform: translateZ(0); } 100% { transform: translateZ(-3000px); } } \`\`\` And the HTML: \`\`\`html <div class=\\"crawl-container\\"> <div class=\\"crawl-text\\"> <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far,<br>far away....</p> <!-- Your story text here --> </div> </div> \`\`\` To see this animation in action, you'd need to run it on a website or an environment that supports HTML and CSS3 animations.
