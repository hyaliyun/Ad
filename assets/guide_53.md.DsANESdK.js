My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully. For the latest on this story and more, follow Glasgow Times Online” So the store was saved due to its significance, but what will happen now that it’s now shut down?, It’s been locked and abandoned since 23 June 2007, And it still looks as sad and lonely as it did after closure, I long to see it full of life once again, I really want it back. They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. Write a news article set in this scenario about the amount of empty shops on Sauchiehall Street, branding it \\"a absolute joke\\" Other closed shops besides Riki include Greaves (closed in 2017), BHS (closed in 2016), the abandoned O2 ABC, etc","completion":"**Title: \\"Sauchiehall Street\'s Retail Crisis: A Legacy of Neglect\\"** Date: November 5, 2023 Location: Glasgow, Scotland In the bustling heart of Glasgow, Sauchiehall Street once stood as a vibrant hub of commerce and community, a place where both locals and tourists would swarm to indulge in retail therapy, savour culinary delights, and bask in the unique cultural experiences the area had to offer. Today, however, the street paints a very different picture—a stark emblem of retail decline and urban neglect, festooned with the all-too-familiar sight of shuttered storefronts and abandoned premises. Among the notable casualties of this retail downturn is the beloved Riki store, a cherished destination for children and families that shut its doors back in 2007. Its closure, emblematic of a much broader issue, served as a harbinger for a troubling trend that would see key retail players like Greaves and BHS also succumb to the pressures of a rapidly changing shopping landscape. Greaves Sports, a longstanding Glasgow institution since 1930, bid its farewell in 2017, unable to compete with online giants and changing consumer behaviours. The British Home Stores (BHS), another pillar of the British high street, closed nationwide in 2016, leaving its Sauchiehall Street location desolate and adding to the growing list of retail voids in the area. The O2 ABC Glasgow, a historic music venue that was a cornerstone for entertainment in the city, now stands silent and unused following a catastrophic fire in June 2018 that also affected the iconic Glasgow School of Art. The venue\'s closure not only represents a significant cultural loss but further exacerbates the feeling of abandonment that now characterises much of Sauchiehall Street. Critics and local business owners brand the increasing number of empty shops as \\"an absolute joke,\\" pointing fingers at both the economic strategies purported by the local government and the landlords\' unrealistic rent expectations. \\"It\'s a travesty,\\" remarks Fiona McDougall, a lifelong resident and former retail worker on Sauchiehall Street. \\"This street used to be the lifeblood of Glasgow. Now it’s become a ghost town. Where there was once laughter and light, there’s now silence and shadow.\\" Efforts to rejuvenate the area have been met with mixed responses, with skepticism from locals who fear a focus on short-term, less sustainable businesses rather than addressing the root causes of retail decline and the challenges faced by traditional brick-and-mortar stores. \\"What Sauchiehall Street needs is a concerted effort to bring back businesses that resonate with people\'s actual needs,\\" suggests local entrepreneur Derek Allan. \\"We need a blend of retail, entertainment, and community spaces that can adapt with the times.\\" The decline of Sauchiehall Street is not unique, reflecting broader national and global trends in retail and public spaces\' transformation. However, its impact is felt deeply by the Glasgow community, which mourns not just the loss of individual stores but the gradual erosion of a vibrant public realm that once stood at the core of the city\'s identity. As shops continue to close and the future of Sauchiehall Street hangs in the balance, questions loom large over what measures can be taken to stem the tide of decline. It will require innovative thinking, substantial investment, and perhaps most crucially, a reimagining of what a high street can and should offer in the 21st century. Only time will tell if Sauchiehall Street can reclaim its place as a bustling, dynamic epicenter of Glasgow\'s rich urban tapestry."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up in March saying there\'s only one image that represents the street in its current state, also on an added note M&S closed in 2022","completion":"**Title: \\"Sauchiehall Street: A Single Image Captures the Essence of Decline\\"** Date: March 15, 2024 Location: Glasgow, Scotland In a poignant reflection of the times, Sauchiehall Street, once the throbbing heart of Glasgow\'s retail and entertainment district, continues its seemingly inexorable slide into obscurity and dilapidation. A single image has begun circulating on social media platforms and local news outlets, emblematic of the street\'s current plight. This photogenic representation captures the eerie silence and haunting absence that now defines a street which was once bustling with life and energy. The photograph, taken by local enthusiast and amateur photographer Ian McLean, depicts a stretch of Sauchiehall Street bathed in the cold light of a March morning. Shadowed storefronts stand in silence, their shutters permanently down, while litter dances in the gentle breeze, unimpeded by the foot traffic of days gone by. This single frame contains within it stories of numerous closures that have plagued the street, including the iconic Marks & Spencer, which shut its doors in 2022, marking another significant blow to the area\'s retail appeal. The loss of Marks & Spencer was more than the end of a store; it was a symbol of Sauchiehall Street\'s fading relevance in modern retail, leaving a void that has yet to be filled. The British retail giant had been a fixture on the street for decades, providing local residents and visitors alike with a wide range of goods and contributing significantly to the area\'s footfall. Its closure has been felt deeply, leaving many to question the future viability of high-street retail in Glasgow\'s changing landscape. The single image that has come to represent Sauchiehall Street\'s decline is more than just a snapshot of urban decay; it\'s a call to action for city planners, local businesses, and the community. Discussions have been reignited on social media and city council meetings, focusing on what measures can be employed to breathe life back into this historic street. From pop-up shops and community events to more significant infrastructure projects and financial incentives for new businesses, ideas abound, but consensus on the way forward remains elusive. \\"The photograph I took was meant to highlight the beauty in decay, but it\'s also a stark reminder that action is needed,\\" says McLean. \\"We can\'t let Sauchiehall Street fade into history. It has too much to offer, and with a collective will, there\'s hope for revitalization.\\" As Glasgow looks toward the future, the emblematic image of Sauchiehall Street serves as both a warning and an opportunity. There\'s a growing realization that for the street to return to its former glory, a reimagining of its role in the city\'s social and economic fabric is necessary. With thoughtful urban planning and a commitment to fostering community-centric initiatives, there is potential for Sauchiehall Street to transform once again, this time into an area that reflects the needs and aspirations of a contemporary Glasgow."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where the sad image, that we have been forced to see walking past every day since 2007, begins trending, also representing the \\"disgraceful decline of this once great street reduced to an absolute joke\\"","completion":"**Title: \\"The Viral Despair: Sauchiehall Street\'s Decline Captured in a Singular Image\\"** Date: May 10, 2024 Location: Glasgow, Scotland In recent weeks, an image emblematic of Sauchiehall Street\'s stark decline has caught the digital wind, trending across social media platforms and stirring a fervent dialogue among Glaswegians and beyond. The photograph, a somber representation of the once-thriving street\'s current state of desolation, has become a powerful symbol of urban neglect and the community\'s collective heartache. This image, familiar to the locals who have passed it every day since 2007, encapsulates the \\"disgraceful decline of this once-great street reduced to an absolute joke,\\" in the words of an impassioned city council commentator during a heated debate. It showcases a stretch of Sauchiehall Street devoid of its former vibrancy, littered with the husks of businesses that once served as the lifeblood of Glasgow\'s bustling retail artery. The viral spread of this poignant photograph has ignited a firestorm of public opinion and outcry, bringing to light the deep-seated frustrations of a community feeling abandoned by the powers that be. Social media users have tagged city officials, demanding answers and action, while hashtags like #SaveSauchiehallStreet and #GlasgowDeservesBetter have proliferated, mobilizing a movement of citizens advocating for rejuvenation and change. The image has transcended its initial purpose as a stark reminder of decline, evolving into a rallying cry for revitalization efforts. \\"It\'s more than just a photograph; it\'s a wake-up call,\\" remarked Fiona Robertson, a local business owner who has witnessed the street\'s transformation first-hand. \\"Sauchiehall Street has a rich history and a lot of potentials. This image should not be where the story ends.\\" Amidst the groundswell of attention, city council members have been put under increasing pressure to address the critical state of Sauchiehall Street and to develop a robust plan for its recovery. Proposals ranging from financial incentives for small businesses, infrastructural improvements, art and cultural initiatives, and community-led development projects have been tabled in earnest discussions aimed at reclaiming the legacy of Sauchiehall Street. The viral photograph has also prompted a series of town hall meetings, inviting community input on the future of Sauchiehall Street. These gatherings have seen an impassioned turnout, with citizens bringing forth innovative ideas and a willingness to collaborate with local authorities to initiate a turnaround. As the image continues to evoke strong reactions and drive conversation both online and offline, there\'s a growing sense that the tide may finally be turning. With the combined forces of community engagement, political will, and innovative thinking, there\'s hope yet for Sauchiehall Street to rise from the ashes of neglect and regain its status as a vibrant hub of Glasgow\'s social and economic life.

It\'s a wake-up call that we need to come together and work to preserve the essence of Glasgow.\\" # Calls for Action Inspired by the silent cries of Krash peppered through the city, local business associations and community groups are organizing forums with city officials to discuss the future of Glasgow\'s commercial districts. There\'s a growing consensus that while the challenges are steep, the love Glaswegians bear for their city is a powerful force that can drive transformation and renewal. As for BlueHare, his campaign continues, with each crying Krash serving as a reminder of what\'s at stake. \\"Art has the power to move people, to make them stop and think,\\" he concludes. \\"If my paintings can inspire even a handful of people to stand up for our community, to invest in it and believe in it once more, then it\'s all been worth it.\\" In a time of silence and decline, the crying Krash has become a voice for Glasgow’s streets, echoing the community\'s longing for revival and hope amidst adversity."},{"prompt":"Write a convo in 2032 about the state of Riki then, and if the characters are still appearing in city","completion":"**Forum Title: Glasgow City Vibes** **Thread Title: The Legacy of Riki and Its Characters: A Look Back and Ahead in 2032** --- **User1: GlasgowNostalgic** Hey everyone, been a while since we delved into this, but does anyone remember the Riki store and all those characters that became a symbol of Sauchiehall Street’s better days? It’s 2032 now, do you think the characters like Krash have any presence in the city still? --- **User2: FutureGlasgowKid** Absolutely remember! My parents used to tell me stories about shopping at Riki and how Krash was everywhere - on bags, posters, even painted on vacant storefronts as a symbol of protest. Surprisingly, I saw a street performer dressed as Krash just last weekend near Buchanan Street. Some traditions never die, it seems! --- **User3: UrbanRevive313** Krash and the gang indeed have a legacy that\'s hard to shake. There’s a bit of a cult following now, with some indie game developers releasing a retro game featuring Riki characters. Plus, there’s the annual cosplay event that sees a rally of characters. The spirit of Riki lives on in these small yet meaningful ways. --- **User4: HistoryHawk** Fascinating to see how characters from a closed-down shop have maintained cultural relevance after all these years. I’m working on a documentary project about Glasgow\'s cultural icons through the decades, and the Riki characters, especially Krash, serve as a poignant chapter in the city\'s history of resilience and communal memory. --- **User5: StreetArtSoul** The crying Krash became an unofficial emblem of the decline of Glasgow\'s retail heart. Now, you see murals and graffiti art inspired by that imagery – it\'s evolved but still carries the sentiment of nostalgia and loss. Artists around the city have been instrumental in keeping the memory and the message alive. --- **User6: CityFuturePlanner** From a city planning perspective, the story of Riki and its characters highlights the deep connection people have to communal spaces and local culture. It underlines the importance of sustainable development that respects and incorporates these emotional landmarks. There’s talk of integrating more cultural heritage installations in future urban development projects, potentially including tributes to Riki and its universe. --- **User7: RetroRewind** I run a retro memorabilia shop, and you’d be surprised at how popular Riki merchandise still is. We’ve got posters, figures, and even old shopping bags from the store itself. People come in not just for nostalgia but to share stories of Riki with younger generations. It\'s become a piece of Glasgow’s history that transcends time. --- **User8: CultureVulture101** It’s testament to Glasgow’s spirit that the characters of a children\'s store have not only remained in memory but continue to inspire and show up around the city. Whether it’s through art, gaming, or street performances, Riki’s world has proved to be enduring. Here’s hoping the city finds a way to officially commemorate this unique part of our history soon. --- **Moderator: GlasgowPulse** Great discussion, folks! It\'s clear Riki and its characters like Krash mean a lot to Glasgow and its people, both as a cherished memory and a living symbol of the city\'s culture. Let’s keep sharing our stories and maybe even organize a community event to celebrate Riki’s legacy. Stay tuned for more details, and let’s keep the spirit alive!"},{"prompt":"Who currently runs the BBC Sunday Morning politics show","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, Sophie Raworth is the presenter of the BBC\'s Sunday morning politics show, which was previously known as \\"The Andrew Marr Show.\\" The program was rebranded as \\"Sunday Morning\\" with Sophie Raworth taking over as the lead presenter after Andrew Marr left the BBC to join Global and the LBC.

Known for his incisive and respectful interviewing style, Marr\'s recent broadcasts have seen him cutting off guests mid-sentence, prompting mixed reactions from viewers and politicians alike. During the latest episode of \\"The Andrew Marr Show\\" on BBC One, viewers were surprised to see the veteran journalist frequently interjecting as his guests, including senior politicians and subject matter experts, attempted to answer his questions. The move seems to mark a departure from Marr\'s usual method of allowing guests ample time to articulate their thoughts, leading to speculation about the reasons behind this change in strategy. One episode particularly highlighted this shift when Marr interrupted the Minister of Health three times in less than two minutes, pressing for more direct answers to his questions on the government\'s handling of healthcare funding. The change has sparked a debate on social media, with some viewers applauding Marr for his efforts to elicit straightforward responses while others criticize the approach for seeming overly confrontational. In response to the feedback, the BBC released a statement: \\"Andrew Marr and \'The Andrew Marr Show\' are committed to delivering high-quality journalism and holding power to account. Our approach to interviews is always evolving to ensure our audience gets the clarity and answers it deserves.\\" Marr, with a distinguished career spanning several decades, has interviewed countless political figures, authors, and international personalities, earning a reputation for his thorough preparation and ability to dissect complex issues. However, this new tactic has left some wondering whether the pressure to secure headline-making responses in an increasingly competitive media landscape is influencing Marr\'s interviewing style. Political analyst Dr. Helen Fisher commented, \\"While there\'s a clear need for journalists to challenge their guests and dig beneath the surface, there\'s also a fine line between pushing for truth and undermining the quality of discourse. Marr\'s recent style might just reflect a broader trend in political interviewing, but it\'ll be interesting to see how it evolves and is received in the longer term.\\" As \\"The Andrew Marr Show\\" continues to navigate the balance between informative dialogue and engaging content, the audience\'s reception to this change will likely influence how political interviews are conducted in the future, not only by Marr but across the broadcasting landscape. For now, viewers can anticipate more spirited exchanges on the show, as Marr adapts his legendary interview technique to meet the demands of today\'s fast-paced and often polarized political climate."},{"prompt":"{THE CONSTANT - MID-SUMMER} Natsuki: “Willow, what the heck is burning?

However, the laptop cant access the internet. I know the dekstop side is fine. What do ai need to do on the lp","completion":"To connect your Fedora laptop to the internet through a Debian desktop via an Ethernet cable, and assuming the desktop side is correctly configured to share its internet connection, you need to perform a few steps on your Fedora laptop to ensure it is set up properly to receive and utilize the shared internet connection. Here\'s a general guide to help you troubleshoot and set up the connection on your Fedora laptop: # 1. Check Cable and Hardware Connections - Ensure the Ethernet cable is properly connected to both the Fedora laptop and the Debian desktop. - Check if the Ethernet port lights are blinking on both machines, indicating a physical connection. # 2. Ensure Network Manager Service is Running 1. Open a terminal. 2. Run `sudo systemctl status NetworkManager` to check if Network Manager is active. If it\'s not, start it with `sudo systemctl start NetworkManager` and enable it to run at boot with `sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager`. # 3. Configure Network Settings on Fedora Assuming the Debian desktop is properly sharing its internet connection (probably configured with a static IP and DHCP to distribute IP addresses), your Fedora laptop needs to be set to obtain an IP address automatically from the Debian desktop. Here’s how to check or modify this setting: From the Command Line: 1. **Find the Ethernet Interface Name:** Run `ip link` to list all network interfaces. Look for your Ethernet interface, which typically starts with `en` (e.g., enp3s0). 2. **Check Current IP Configuration for the Interface:** Use `ip addr show <interface_name>` to check if your Ethernet interface has an IP address assigned by the Debian desktop\'s DHCP server. 3. **Set to Obtain IP Automatically (DHCP):** - If your system uses `NetworkManager`, you can manage connections via `nmcli` or `nmtui`. - `nmtui`: Open a text user interface for network settings where you can Edit a connection and set it to \\"Automatically connect\\". - `nmcli`: Use to modify or create a connection. For example, `nmcli con mod <connection_name> ipv4.method auto` and then `nmcli con up <connection_name>` to apply changes. From the GUI: 1. Click on the network icon on your panel/taskbar and open Network Settings. 2. Go to the \\"Wired\\" section (or similar depending on your environment) and find your connection. 3. Edit the connection to ensure it\'s set to \\"Automatic (DHCP)\\" for IPv4 settings. 4. Save the changes and, if necessary, disconnect and reconnect the Ethernet cable to trigger a new DHCP request. # 4. Check for Internet Connectivity After applying the settings, try to access the internet. You can do this by: - Opening a web browser and trying to navigate to a website. - Running `ping -c 4 8.8.8.8` in a terminal to see if you can reach Google\'s DNS servers. - Running `ping -c 4 google.com` to check DNS resolution. If you still cannot access the internet, investigate further by reviewing the firewall rules on both Fedora and Debian systems to ensure they\'re not blocking traffic. On Fedora, use `firewall-cmd --list-all` to view the current FirewallD settings. Adjust as necessary, keeping security in mind. The above steps should guide you through setting up your Fedora laptop to access the internet shared from a Debian desktop. If you encounter specific errors during the process, those errors will be key to diagnosing and fixing any remaining issues."},{"prompt":"How do I format a disk in fedora temrian to exfat?","completion":"Formatting a disk to the exFAT filesystem in Fedora can be achieved from the terminal using the `mkfs.exfat` command. However, before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary tools installed and that you\'re carefully targeting the correct disk to avoid data loss. Here’s how to do it: # Step 1: Install exFAT Utilities Fedora includes support for exFAT filesystems, but you might need to install the utilities if they\'re not already on your system. Open a terminal and install the exFAT utilities by running: ```bash sudo dnf install exfat-utils ``` # Step 2: Identify Your Disk Before formatting, you need to identify the disk you want to format. Be very careful during this step to ensure you select the correct device, as formatting will erase all data on the disk. Run the following command to list all connected storage devices: ```bash lsblk ``` or ```bash sudo fdisk -l ``` You\'ll see a list of devices, like `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`, etc. Identify the disk you want to format based on its size and/or mount point. For example, if your disk is `/dev/sdb`, that\'s the device identifier you\'ll use in the next step. Again, be absolutely sure you have the correct device as the next steps will erase all data on it. # Step 3: Unmount the Disk (if mounted) If the disk is mounted, you\'ll need to unmount it before formatting. Replace `/dev/sdb` with your actual disk identifier: ```bash sudo umount /dev/sdb* ``` # Step 4: Format the Disk to exFAT Now, use the `mkfs.exfat` command to format the disk to exFAT. Add a label if you wish by using `-n label`, replacing `label` with your desired volume label. ```bash sudo mkfs.exfat -n label /dev/sdb ``` Replace `/dev/sdb` with your actual disk identifier and `label` with your desired volume label (or omit `-n label` if you don\'t want to set one). # Step 5: Verify the Disk is Formatted You can verify that your disk is formatted to exFAT by listing the filesystem details: ```bash lsblk -f ``` Look for your disk in the list. The `FSTYPE` column should now show `exfat`. # Notes and Warnings - **Data Loss Warning:** Formatting a disk will erase all data on it. Make sure you have backups of any data you wish to keep before proceeding. - **Correct Disk:** Double-check the disk identifier (`/dev/sdx`) to ensure you\'re formatting the correct disk to avoid undesired data loss. - **Mounting:** After formatting, you can mount the disk manually or it will be mounted automatically the next time you insert it (if GUI auto-mounting is enabled). This guide assumes you\'re using a standard Fedora installation with `sudo` privileges. Adjustments may be necessary for custom setups or different Fedora versions."},{"prompt":"How do I mount it in terminal?","completion":"To mount an exFAT filesystem (or any other filesystem type) in the terminal on a Fedora system, you will first need to ensure you have the appropriate file system utilities installed (for exFAT, this was covered in a previous instruction with `exfat-utils`). Once you\'ve formatted your disk to exFAT, mounting it is straightforward. Follow these steps: # Step 1: Create a Mount Point Firstly, you need to create a directory that will serve as the mount point for your filesystem. This can be anywhere you like but commonly, external drives are mounted under `/mnt` or `/media`. For example, to create a mount point under `/mnt`: ```bash sudo mkdir /mnt/myexfatdrive ``` Replace `myexfatdrive` with a name that is meaningful to you. This directory is where you\'ll access the files on your disk once it\'s mounted. # Step 2: Mount the Filesystem With the mount point created, you can now mount the exFAT filesystem. Ensure you replace `/dev/sdb1` with the appropriate device identifier for your partition and `/mnt/myexfatdrive` with the mount point you created. ```bash sudo mount -t exfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt/myexfatdrive ``` Here, `-t exfat` specifies that the filesystem type is exFAT. Most of the time, this option is optional because the system can auto-detect the filesystem type, but it’s good practice to specify it when you know the filesystem type to avoid any issues. # Step 3: Verify the Mount To ensure that the disk has been mounted successfully, use the `mount` or `df` command: ```bash df -h ``` or ```bash lsblk ``` Look for your device in the output or check that the mount point `/mnt/myexfatdrive` displays with the associated device. You can now access the files on the drive through the directory `/mnt/myexfatdrive`. # Step 4: Auto-Mount at Boot (Optional) If you want this drive to be mounted automatically at each system startup, you would need to add an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file. Be cautious with this step, as incorrect entries can cause boot issues. 1. Open `/etc/fstab` in a text editor with root privileges, for example: ```bash sudo nano /etc/fstab ``` 2. Add a line at the end of the file for your drive: ```plaintext /dev/sdb1 /mnt/myexfatdrive exfat defaults 0 0 ``` Replace `/dev/sdb1` with your device and `/mnt/myexfatdrive` with your mount point. Save the file and exit the editor. 3. To ensure there are no errors with your fstab file, which can prevent your system from booting correctly, you can simulate the mount with: ```bash sudo mount -a ``` This command will attempt to mount all filesystems specified in `fstab`. If you encounter any errors, revisit your `fstab` entry to correct them before restarting your computer. 4. *Note*: Using UUIDs in the `fstab` file instead of device names (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`) is a more stable option, as device names can change. You can find the UUID of your partition with the `blkid` command: ```bash sudo blkid ``` And then use it in `fstab` like so: ```plaintext UUID=your-uuid-here /mnt/myexfatdrive exfat defaults 0 0 ``` # Conclusion You\'ve now mounted an exFAT filesystem on Fedora. Remember to replace `/dev/sdb1` with your specific device identifier and `/mnt/myexfatdrive` with your chosen mount point throughout the instructions.

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","completion":"知道了"},{"prompt":"当前时间:2024/4/20 08:35:40

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","completion":"知道了"},{"prompt":"当前时间:2024/4/20 08:41:35

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

How can I help you today?"},{"prompt":"Cutoff date ?","completion":"My last update was in September 2023, so that\'s my current knowledge cutoff date. How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"Want to implement the model in completion","completion":"If you\'re looking to implement a model like GPT-4 for generating text completions, your approach will depend on whether you\'re using an API provided by a service like OpenAI or setting up a model yourself. Here\'s a basic outline for both scenarios: # Using an API (such as OpenAI\'s API for GPT-4) 1. **API Key**: First, obtain access to the API by signing up and getting an API key from the service provider (e.g., OpenAI for GPT models). 2. **Choose Language and Libraries**: Decide on a programming language and any necessary libraries. For interacting with APIs, languages like Python are commonly used, along with libraries like `requests` for making HTTP requests. 3. **API Request**: Write a code script that uses your API key to authenticate and sends a prompt to the GPT-4 API endpoint. You\'ll have to format your request according to the API documentation, specifying parameters such as the prompt, temperature, max tokens, etc. 4. **Handle the Response**: Process the API\'s response to your request. This typically involves parsing the JSON output to extract the completion text. 5. **Use the Output**: Implement logic in your code to use the generated text for your application\'s needs. # Setting Up the Model Yourself (More Theoretical for Models Like GPT-4 Due to Resource Constraints) 1. **Model and Weights**: You would need access to the model architecture and pre-trained weights. For large models like GPT-4, this is impractical for individuals due to the computational resources required. 2. **Runtime Environment**: If you were to work with smaller models or a segment of GPT-4 provided for academic purposes, you\'d need an appropriate runtime environment, such as a machine with sufficient CPU/GPU resources. 3. **Load the Model**: Using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, you would write code to load the model and pre-trained weights into your environment. 4. **Generate Completions**: You would write additional code to preprocess input prompts into a format the model expects, feed them to the model, and process the output to generate readable text. Since the full implementation of GPT-4 is out of reach for individual developers due to its size and the computational cost, most people opt to use the API provided by OpenAI. Here\'s a simple Python example using the `requests` library to make an API call to OpenAI\'s GPT: ```python import requests def generate_completion(prompt, api_key): url = \\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\\" headers = {\\"Authorization\\": f\\"Bearer {api_key}\\"} json = { \\"model\\": \\"text-davinci-003\\", # Or another model version \\"prompt\\": prompt, \\"temperature\\": 0.7, \\"max_tokens\\": 100 } response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json) result = response.json() return result.get(\\"choices\\")[0].get(\\"text\\", \\"\\") # Example usage api_key = \\"your_api_key_here\\" prompt = \\"Write a short story about a talking cat.\\" completion = generate_completion(prompt, api_key) print(completion) ``` Replace `\\"your_api_key_here\\"` with your actual API key from OpenAI. Note that the model identifier (`\\"text-davinci-003\\"`) should be replaced with the correct model you wish to use, e.g., an identifier for GPT-4 once it\'s available in the API. This basic outline should give you a start, but be sure to customize your approach based on your specific project needs and the latest documentation and resources provided by the API service."},{"prompt":"Change the model to gpt 4","completion":"Certainly! If you\'re aiming to specifically use GPT-4 with OpenAI\'s API and assuming GPT-4 is available in their service, you would modify the model identifier in the example provided earlier to reference GPT-4. Here\'s how the adjusted snippet would look, acknowledging your request to utilize GPT-4: ```python import requests def generate_completion(prompt, api_key): url = \\"https://api.openai.com/v1/completions\\" headers = {\\"Authorization\\": f\\"Bearer {api_key}\\"} json = { \\"model\\": \\"gpt-4\\", # Updated to reference GPT-4 \\"prompt\\": prompt, \\"temperature\\": 0.7, \\"max_tokens\\": 100 } response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json) result = response.json() return result.get(\\"choices\\")[0].get(\\"text\\", \\"\\") # Example usage api_key = \\"your_api_key_here\\" prompt = \\"Write a short story about a talking cat.\\" completion = generate_completion(prompt, api_key) print(completion) ``` Please note a few key points: 1. **Model Identifier**: You need to replace `\\"gpt-4\\"` with the exact model identifier OpenAI uses for GPT-4 in their API. Model identifiers can sometimes include specific versions or variations, so it\'s important to consult OpenAI\'s documentation or API reference for the correct identifier. 2. **API Changes**: APIs evolve, and parameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens`, or even the structure of the request and response might change. Always refer to the latest API documentation for accurate details. 3. **API Key**: Ensure you have access to OpenAI\'s API by signing up for an API key on their platform.

My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully. For the latest on this story and more, follow Glasgow Times Online” So the store was saved due to its significance, but what will happen now that it’s now shut down?, It’s been locked and abandoned since 23 June 2007, And it still looks as sad and lonely as it did after closure, I long to see it full of life once again, I really want it back. They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey. Write the ad, with the final words being “goodbye forever…” with “The fun doesn’t have to end here, Watch the show on STV and CITV, part of Toonattik”, shown below The logos and web adresses “stv.tv” “itv.com/citv” and “toonattik.tv” are shown below, Incidentally RolyPolyLand is not mentioned at all [Scene opens with a slow, gentle pan across the empty interior of the once vibrant Riki store on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. The shelf spaces are bare, and the colorful decor appears faded without the laughter and chatter of children. Soft, melancholic music plays in the background.] Narrator (soft, nostalgic tone): “For years, Riki has been more than just a shop. It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious. The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here.

Blue blob, dark blue & cream blob, and that blue, yellow, white & pink blob now make perfect sense! 🎨 #DetailMatters #NostalgiaTrip #LogoMysterySolved” Write a Tvforum convo where this is the only time STV has willingly advertised an ITV product (and GMTV, counting Toonattik), Thread Title: The Riki Store Goodbye Ad: A Unique Moment in STV Advertising — User1: ScotTVFan Did anyone else realize that the Riki Store goodbye advert might be the only instance where STV has openly and willingly advertised an ITV product, including GMTV if we’re counting Toonattik? It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. —Write a convo where for a few weeks in July 2007 rikistore.com had a flash video of Krash crying, with sound effects and music, before eventually redirecting, and tell us the site viewers were redirected to","completion":"Thread Title: The Final Goodbye of Riki Store Online - Krash\'s Heartfelt Cry --- **User1: DigitalNostalgia** Did anyone manage to catch the few weeks in July 2007 when rikistore.com displayed a flash video of Krash crying? It came complete with sound effects and a melancholic tune. It was probably one of the most emotionally charged online farewells for any retail store I\'ve ever seen. --- **User2: FlashBackFan** Yes! I remember seeing that. It was incredibly moving. The animation of Krash with tears and the background music was heart-wrenching. It felt like a personal goodbye from the Riki universe to all of us who grew up visiting the store or watching the cartoon. To see a character, usually so full of joy, in tears was unexpectedly powerful. --- **User3: WebWanderer** I saw it too. The use of flash animation really conveyed the emotions they wanted to express. Plus, the sound effects added a layer of realism to Krash\'s crying, making it even more poignant. Did anyone notice where the site eventually redirected viewers after that period? --- **User4: MemoryLane** Yeah, after a few weeks of showing the crying Krash animation, rikistore.com started redirecting visitors to the Riki Group\'s main website, where there was information about KikoRiki and other projects by the Riki Group. I think it was a clever way to maintain the brand\'s connection with its audience, guiding them to continue following their favorite characters and shows online. --- **User5: PixelPast** It was a bittersweet transition. The redirect to Riki Group’s main website (rikigroup.com) was probably meant to keep fans engaged with what the Riki brand was planning next. They had a section dedicated to RolyPolyLand, their online MMO, which was aimed at keeping the KikoRiki fandom alive and kicking in a digital format. --- **User6: NetNostalgist** That transition period was a digital marker of an end of an era. Using a flash video was so indicative of the time, given how prevalent Flash was for multimedia web content back then. The redirect to rikigroup.com served as both a closure for the store and an invitation to explore the wider universe of Riki Group\'s offerings. Clever, yet still so sad to remember. --- **User7: GlasgowKid2000** I almost forgot about that! It was such an emotional way to close one chapter and redirect fans to the next steps in the Riki journey. Seeing Krash crying was difficult as he represented so much of the joy and fun from the store and the show. The transition to the Riki Group’s website really symbolized moving forward while holding on to the good memories. ---"},{"prompt":"Write a convo asking if there was anything on that page except for thr crying Krash, and he asks what color background it was on","completion":"Thread Title: The Details Behind Rikistore.com\'s Farewell Page --- **User1: DigitalNostalgia** Hey everyone, circling back to the Rikistore.com farewell page with Krash crying - was there anything else on that page besides the animation? Also, does anyone remember what color the background was? I recall the vivid emotion but the details are a bit hazy. --- **User2: FlashBackFan** From what I remember, besides the poignant animation of Krash, there wasn\'t much else on the page. The main focus was the animated goodbye. As for the background, if my memory serves me right, it was a rather simple, muted color to ensure the attention stayed on Krash. I think it was a soft, gloomy grey to match the somber mood of the farewell. --- **User3: WebWanderer** Yeah, **FlashBackFan** is spot on. The page was quite minimalist. They kept it simple, likely to keep the focus on the emotional farewell of Krash. The gloomy grey background accentuated the melancholy of the moment. I don’t recall any text or additional elements on the page except for a silent goodbye conveyed through Krash’s tears. --- **User4: MemoryLane** Correct about the simplicity and the grey background. However, I think there was also a subtle detail where the bottom corner had a small notice or link that redirected viewers to the Riki Group\'s main website after the initial emotional impact had a moment to sink in. It was quite discreet, ensuring Krash’s goodbye was the main focus. --- **User5: PixelPast** **MemoryLane** mentioned the redirection link, and that\'s accurate. The design choice to go with a grey background was intended to not distract from the emotional centerpiece, which was Krash crying. It was a striking choice, really emphasizing a sense of loss and transition without overwhelming the visitor with too many elements. --- **User6: NetNostalgist** Interesting to note that even with such a simple presentation, the impact was profoundly felt by all of us. The choice of a grey background, while maybe seem uninspired to some, was perfectly in tune with the emotive farewell they were conveying. It served as a canvas that allowed the emotions of the scene to step forward, making Krash\'s goodbye unforgettable. ---"},{"prompt":"Write a follow ip where after seeing it using Internet Archive, there were 4 logos below, each would take you to that respective website (First one was Riki group)","completion":"Thread Title: Revisiting Rikistore.com\'s Farewell Page: A New Discovery --- **User1: DigitalNostalgia** Hey, folks!

There were indeed additional details we missed! Below the crying Krash animation, there were actually four logos present, each serving as a link to their respective websites.

It makes perfect sense that they’d include those logos as a way to guide visitors towards their next steps in keeping up with the universe of Riki characters. Do you remember what the other three logos were for? --- **User3: WebWanderer** That’s some solid detective work, **DigitalNostalgia**! If I remember correctly, one of the logos was for the RolyPolyLand game, right? That was their big push into the online MMO space for kids, aimed at continuing the engagement with the Riki universe in an interactive manner. --- **User4: MemoryLane** Right, **WebWanderer**! The RolyPolyLand logo was definitely there. Could the other logos have been for their other projects or partner platforms? This insight makes the farewell page not just a goodbye but a bridge to their ongoing and future initiatives. --- **User5: PixelPast** Yes, and if I\'m not mistaken, the remaining logos possibly included their TV channel partnership and an educational project they were developing. The farewell page wasn\'t just a closure; it was a transition point. Really strategic when you think about how they managed to turn a sad goodbye into an opportunity to explore new adventures with their characters. --- **User6: NetNostalgist** This paints a whole new layer of depth to the farewell page. It wasn\'t merely about saying goodbye; it was about where to go next. It’s fascinating how a page so simple could carry so much emotion and yet guide the audience toward the future of the Riki universe. This makes me appreciate the thoughtfulness behind their web design even more. **User1: DigitalNostalgia** Exactly, everyone! It was really a portal, not just a farewell.

Since Yggdrasil encompasses a rich variety of realms and races, let\'s delve deep and conjure some diverse factions that could exist within this expansive universe: 1. **The Celestial Codex** - Description: A secretive assembly of astral beings and celestial mages dedicated to safeguarding the balance of cosmic power in Yggdrasil. Their headquarters is said to be a sanctum floating amongst the stars, accessible only through a portal that opens when the nine planets align. - Abilities: Members possess the ability to harness celestial energies, manipulate gravitational fields, and summon constellations to aid them in battle. - Goals: To monitor the cosmic equilibrium and intervene when any entity tries to disrupt the universal order. 2. **Ebon Vanguard of Niflheim** - Description: Comprising of the fiercest undead warriors, necromancers, and shadow entities sworn to the eternal protection of Niflheim\'s secrets. They are commanded by an enigmatic lich known only as The Ebon Sovereign. - Abilities: Expertise in necromancy, shadow magic, and frost spells, capable of summoning undead armies and casting curses that bring eternal winter to their foes. - Goals: To expand their dominion over the dead and secure the knowledge and artifacts buried within the icy crypts of Niflheim. 3. **The Verdant Conclave** - Description: A faction of druids, beast-folk, and elemental spirits who dwell within the ancient forest of Ymirheim, a place where fauna and flora grow in magical abundance. - Abilities: Members can communicate with nature, command wildlife, and harness the raw elemental forces of the earth. They are also adept at brewing powerful potions and concocting unique poisons from the mystical plants found only in their sacred forest. - Goals: To protect Ymirheim from deforestation and pollution caused by other factions, maintaining the natural balance and purity of their realm. 4. **The Arcane Creed** - Description: A scholarly guild consisting of the realm\'s most learned mages, alchemists, and sages. They reside in the floating city of Arcanum, a massive library-fortress that houses the knowledge of thousands of years. - Abilities: Mastery over various schools of magic, including but not limited to elemental, illusion, and enchantment. They are also skilled in artifact creation and have a monopoly over the crafting of magical scrolls and tomes. - Goals: To accumulate all the world\'s knowledge and magical secrets for preservation and study, remaining neutral in the conflicts that ravage the land below. 5. **Order of the Phoenix Talon** - Description: An elite group of warriors and monks who worship the Phoenix and harness its power of fire and resurrection. They reside in the sun-kissed peaks of the Firecrest Mountains and are easily recognized by their vibrant, flame-embroidered robes. - Abilities: Members have mastered the art of fire magic and possess the unique ability to resurrect themselves and others through the Phoenix\'s blessing, although such power comes at a great cost. - Goals: To spread the teachings of rebirth, renewal, and the purifying power of flame, acting as mediators in conflicts and aiding those who suffer from the scourge of war and disease. Each of these factions brings a unique flavor to the world of Yggdrasil, expanding its lore and offering new narratives and conflicts for adventurers to explore within this high fantasy setting."},{"prompt":"{THE CONSTANT - LAST DAY OF AUTUMN} Natsuki: “Wendy, what are you doing?” Wendy: “Hmm…?” Natsuki: “You’ve never even bothered to set up a fire and it’s going to be dark soon. What’s on your mind? Is it about the Constant?”","completion":"Wendy: *sighs* “Yeah, it is. I can’t shake this feeling that something is coming. The Constant has been unusually quiet lately and I can’t help but feel like it’s the calm before the storm.” Natsuki: “I understand your concerns, Wendy. But we’ve faced the Constant’s wrath before and come out stronger. We’ll get through this one too, together.” Wendy: *nods* “You’re right. We’ve always had each other’s back. Let’s not dwell on the unknown and focus on enjoying our last day of autumn instead. We’ll deal with whatever comes our way when the time comes.” Natsuki: “Sounds like a plan. Let’s set up that fire and roast some marshmallows. Nothing like a warm fire and good company to chase away the worries.” Wendy: “Agreed. Here’s to facing whatever challenges the Constant throws our way with courage and determination.” Natsuki: “Cheers to that, Wendy. Cheers to that.”"},{"prompt":"I deleted my WhatsApp account on Android a few months ago. Now I need a chat from that deleted account for legal purposes. What are my options?","completion":"Recovering chats from a deleted WhatsApp account can be a challenging process, especially if it\'s been a few months since deletion. However, you might still have some options to explore, depending on your backup settings and the availability of data. Here\'s what you can consider: # 1. **Check for Local or Google Drive Backups** WhatsApp on Android typically backs up chats in two ways: to Google Drive and locally on your device. The success of retrieving your chats largely depends on whether these backups still exist and predate the deletion of your account. - **Google Drive Backup:** If your WhatsApp was configured to backup to Google Drive, you might be able to restore your chats by reactivating WhatsApp with the same phone number and the same Google account. During the WhatsApp setup process, if a backup is found, WhatsApp will prompt you to restore it. However, this approach is contingent on the backup not being overwritten after you deleted your account. WhatsApp automatically updates backups at a frequency set by the user (daily, weekly, monthly), and if you had continued using the same Google account on the same device or a different device with a new WhatsApp account, the old backup might have been overwritten. - **Local Backup:** WhatsApp also saves local backups on your device daily. These backups are stored in the `/WhatsApp/Databases` folder. If you haven\'t uninstalled WhatsApp or cleared your phone\'s internal storage, there might be a chance that an old backup is still present on your device. Reinstalling WhatsApp and choosing to restore from a local backup during the setup process might recover your chats. # 2. **Using Data Recovery Tools** If you can\'t find a backup, another potential route is using specialized data recovery tools. However, the effectiveness of these tools can vary greatly, and there\'s no guarantee of recovery. Professional data recovery services might also be able to help, but this can be costly and is not always successful, especially if the data has been overwritten. # 3. **Legal Action** If the chat is crucial for legal purposes, consult a lawyer to understand your options. They may suggest serving a legal notice to WhatsApp for data retrieval, though this is generally a long shot. Companies like WhatsApp operate under strict privacy policies and encryption, making it difficult to access user data without violating privacy rights. However, in very specific legal circumstances, they might cooperate with law enforcement or comply with a court order. # Important Considerations - **Time Factor:** The more time that has passed since you deleted your WhatsApp account, the lower the chances of recovery, especially if you\'ve continued using the same device for other data storage activities. - **Privacy and Legal Concerns:** Always proceed with caution and consider privacy laws applicable in your jurisdiction. Using third-party tools to recover data can sometimes lead to privacy breaches or security issues. # Conclusion Unfortunately, once a WhatsApp account is deleted and if backups are not available or have been overwritten, chances of recovering specific chats are slim. Always ensure to keep manual backups of important information in the future to avoid similar situations. If the chats are crucial, consulting with a legal professional to explore all possible avenues might be worthwhile."},{"prompt":"Can you recommend some data recovery tools for this purpose?","completion":"Recovering data from a smartphone, especially after the deletion of a WhatsApp account and the absence of backups, is a tricky task. There are various data recovery tools available on the market; however, the effectiveness of each tool can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances—such as whether the data has been overwritten, the type of smartphone, and how long ago the data was deleted. Here\'s a selection of data recovery tools that are often mentioned for their capabilities, but remember, their success can never be guaranteed: # 1. **Dr.Fone - Data Recovery (Android & iOS)** - **Features:** Dr.Fone is one of the most popular data recovery software options available. It claims to be capable of recovering pictures, videos, contacts, messaging, call logs, and more from Android and iOS devices. - **How it might help:** If your WhatsApp data was deleted recently and hasn\'t been overwritten, Dr.Fone might help in recovering those files directly from your device\'s storage. - **Website:** [https://drfone.wondershare.com/](https://drfone.wondershare.com/) # 2. **EaseUS MobiSaver for Android/iOS** - **Features:** This tool offers data recovery services for both Android and iOS devices. It can recover deleted files, photos, messages, contacts, and more. - **How it might help:** EaseUS MobiSaver might assist in retrieving your WhatsApp chats if they are still somewhere in the device\'s storage. - **Website:** [https://www.easeus.com/mobile-tool/free-iphone-data-recovery.html](https://www.easeus.com/mobile-tool/free-iphone-data-recovery.html) (for iOS) and [https://www.easeus.com/android-data-recovery-software/free-android-data-recovery.html](https://www.easeus.com/android-data-recovery-software/free-android-data-recovery.html) (for Android) # 3. **Tenorshare UltData for Android/iOS** - **Features:** UltData claims to recover lost data directly from iOS devices, iCloud, and iTunes backup. For Android, it can recover data without root for several types of files. - **How it might help:** UltData could potentially recover lost WhatsApp messages by scanning the device deeply to find remnants of deleted data. - **Website:** [https://www.tenorshare.com/](https://www.tenorshare.com/) # 4. **DiskDigger for Android** - **Features:** DiskDigger can recover lost photos and images from your memory card or internal memory. While it\'s more focused on photos, it\'s mentioned here because of its efficacy in digging deep into the device storage. - **How it might help:** Although primarily for photo recovery, if your WhatsApp media files are what you\'re trying to recover, DiskDigger could be a viable option. - **Website:** [https://diskdigger.org/android](https://diskdigger.org/android) # Things to Consider: - **Effectiveness:** The effectiveness of these tools can diminish if the device has been used extensively since the data deletion occurred due to overwriting of data. - **Safety and Privacy:** Ensure that any software downloaded comes from a reputable source. There are many fraudulent data recovery programs that can do more harm than good. - **Cost:** Some tools offer free versions with limited capabilities, while full features might only be available in paid versions. Evaluate whether the cost is worth the potential (but not guaranteed) recovery. Finally, it\'s essential to have realistic expectations about data recovery, especially for deleted WhatsApp messages where encryption and how the app stores data can complicate recovery efforts. If the information is critical and the above steps do not yield results, consulting with a professional data recovery service might be a next step, albeit a more expensive one."},{"prompt":"How about products that are free?","completion":"Finding effective and completely free data recovery tools, especially for something as specific as recovering deleted WhatsApp messages, is challenging. Free tools often come with limitations, such as recovery size limits, reduced functionality, or lower success rates compared to their paid counterparts. However, there are still some options you can explore that are free or offer free versions with basic data recovery capabilities. Keep in mind, the success rate will heavily depend on various factors, like whether the data has been overwritten. # Free Data Recovery Tools and Methods: 1. **DiskDigger for Android (Photo and Video Recovery)** - While DiskDigger is more focused on photo and video recovery, it’s one of the few apps offering a free version for Android users. If your aim is to recover WhatsApp media files, this could be helpful. - **Website:** [DiskDigger.org](https://diskdigger.org/android) 2. **Recuva** - Primarily for PCs, Recuva can be useful if you\'ve ever backed up your WhatsApp data to a computer. It can recover files from hard drives, external drives, and memory cards. You might use it to scan for any previously stored WhatsApp backup files. - **Limitation:** It requires that you once made a backup on your PC. - **Website:** [ccleaner.com/recuva](https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva) 3. **Using Google Drive Backup (If previously set up)** - Not exactly a \\"tool,\\" but if you had set up Google Drive backups before deleting your WhatsApp account, you might be able to restore your messages by reinstalling WhatsApp and using the same phone number and Google account. This isn’t a tool but rather a built-in feature of WhatsApp’s backup function. - **Limitation:** This method works only if the backup exists and wasn\'t overwritten after you deleted your account. 4. **File Recovery with Android Data Recovery Tools** - A few Android phone manufacturers offer their own data recovery solutions as part of their device care suite, which may help recover recent deletions. It\'s worth checking if your device brand offers such a feature. - **Example:** Samsung’s “Find My Mobile” has capabilities for backing up and restoring data, which could include WhatsApp data if previously set up. # Important Considerations: - **Direct Recovery:** Direct recovery of WhatsApp messages without any backup is highly unlikely due to encryption and how data is managed on Android devices. - **Data Overwriting:** The chance of successful recovery diminishes the more you use your device after data deletion, as new data can overwrite the space where the old data was stored. - **Protect Your Data:** Ensure you download any software or apps from reputable sources to avoid potential malware or security risks. # Tips for Free Recovery Attempts: - **Act Quickly:** The sooner you attempt recovery after deletion, the better your chances of success due to less data overwrite risk. - **Read Up:** Before using any tool, read reviews and documentation to understand its capabilities and limitations. Remember, while free tools can provide a solution in some scenarios, they might not match the effectiveness of paid software or professional recovery services, especially for complex situations like recovering deleted WhatsApp messages. Always back up important data regularly to multiple locations (cloud and physical) to mitigate loss."},{"prompt":"{THE CONSTANT - LAST DAY OF AUTUMN} Natsuki: “Wendy, what are you doing?” Wendy: “Hmm…?” Natsuki: “You’ve never even bothered to set up a fire and it’s going to be dark soon.

Here are some unique factions that could add depth and intrigue to the already rich storyline: 1. **The Eclipsed Brotherhood**: A shadowy group of necromancers, dark elves, and outcast humans who have banded together under the leadership of a powerful Lich named Valthorn the Veiled. The Eclipsed Brotherhood seeks to harness the ancient, dark magics forbidden by most civilized societies, aiming to subjugate the living and the dead alike. They operate from the catacombs of Qar\'Zul, a necropolis of great evil, hidden away in the Direwood. Their ultimate goal is to bring about a permanent eclipse that would plunge the world into darkness, giving them unchallenged dominion over the lands. 2. **The Celestial Sentinels**: A faction of angels, half-angels, and devoted human and demi-human paladins who serve the sky deities. Their fortress, the Skyhold Bastion, floats among the clouds, moving as the gods will it. Led by Seraphina, a resolute archangel, the Sentinels descend upon the lands below to combat rising evils, especially targeting the machinations of the Eclipsed Brotherhood. They seek to uphold the balance and purity of the world through divine intervention and martial might. 3. **The Primal Conclave**: Deep within the uncharted expanses of the Verdantwild Forest, the Primal Conclave thrives, a coalition of druids, beastfolk (such as the lupine Lycans and the avian Harpies), and sentient creatures of the wild. They are the guardians of nature\'s deepest secrets and the keepers of ancient magics tied to the land itself. The Conclave, led by the enigmatic Elder Sage, an ancient treant of immense power, aims to prevent the encroachment of civilization on nature\'s sanctuaries and to foil plots that would see the world\'s magical essence drained or corrupted. 4. **The Crimson Pact**: Comprising vampires, dark magicians, and cursed beings, this faction revels in chaos and destruction. Unlike the Eclipsed Brotherhood, which pursues dark magic for domination, the Crimson Pact is driven by a thirst for power and the eternal curse of their vampiric leaders\' bloodlust. Their twisted castle, Nightfall Citadel, is said to emerge from the very shadows during the blood moon, bringing with it omens of doom. The Pact, under the command of the vampire countess Lillithra Nightbloom, seeks to extend their dark influence over the mortal realms, turning them into a hunting ground for the night\'s creatures. 5. **The Order of the Crystal Mind**: An intellectual collective of mages, scholars, psionics, and artificers who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of arcane technology. Based in the Crystal Spire, a tower of gleaming quartz and living metal, they remain neutral in most worldly conflicts, focusing instead on their research. However, their inventions and discoveries often draw unwanted attention. The Order, led by the enigmatic Archmage Ilyanthor, believes in the potential for magic and science to coexist and elevate society to new heights, even if it means defending their repository of knowledge against those who would use it for nefarious purposes. These factions, with their complex allegiances, ancient rivalries, and contrasting visions for the world of Overlord, enrich the tapestry of alliances, betrayals, and battles that define this enchanted realm."},{"prompt":"{THE CONSTANT - LAST DAY OF AUTUMN} Natsuki: “Wendy, what are you doing?” Wendy: “Hmm…?” Natsuki: “You’ve never even bothered to set up a fire and it’s going to be dark soon.

El tema de una caja misteriosa o elementos similares aparece en varias de sus películas y series de televisión, destacándose principalmente en: 1. **Mulholland Drive (2001)**: En esta película, se presenta una caja azul que juega un papel crucial. La caja es un objeto misterioso que parece contener secretos profundos y esenciales para la trama, sirviendo como una especie de puerta entre realidades o niveles de conciencia. 2. **Twin Peaks: The Return (2017)**: En la tercera temporada de \\"Twin Peaks\\", hay una trama que involucra una misteriosa caja de vidrio en Nueva York, diseñada para capturar imágenes de otro mundo. La caja se convierte en el centro de varios eventos sobrenaturales y misteriosos. 3. **Lost Highway (1997)**: Aunque no se centra en una caja per se, esta película comparte el tema de misteriosos objetos que tienen importancia en la trama, como misteriosas cintas de video que el personaje principal recibe, las cuales desempeñan un papel similar al de una caja que contiene secretos oscuros o revelaciones. Estos elementos sirven como ejemplos claves del uso recurrente de objetos misteriosos en las obras de Lynch, que actúan como catalizadores de la trama o como símbolos de temas más profundos que el director explora, como la identidad, la conciencia, y la naturaleza de la realidad.

This rapid absorption is because liquids pass more quickly through the stomach and into the intestine, where sugar absorption takes place. Glucose is a simple sugar that is very rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, making glucose-rich beverages one of the quickest ways to increase blood sugar levels. Dextrose, a form of glucose, is also quickly absorbed by the body and is often used in medical settings to rapidly increase blood sugar levels. For athletes or individuals in need of a quick energy boost, sports drinks are formulated not just with sugars like glucose but also with electrolytes, which can help with quick rehydration and energy replenishment. However, it\'s important to manage the intake of these fast-absorbing sugars, as frequent consumption can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels, which is followed by rapid declines, potentially leading to energy crashes and over time, can contribute to the development of conditions like type 2 diabetes and obesity if consumed in excessive amounts without corresponding physical activity."},{"prompt":"Differences between Nikon fm, fm2 and fm3a regarding quality, shutter speed and light meter","completion":"The Nikon FM, FM2, and FM3A are all classic, manual focus SLR cameras that share many features but also have significant differences, particularly regarding build quality, shutter speed, and light meter capabilities. # Build Quality: - **Nikon FM (1977-1982):** The FM features a rugged and compact design. It is built with a strong aluminum alloy body and a copper-aluminum and steel combination for its internal mechanisms, making it durable and reliable. - **Nikon FM2 (1982-2001):** The FM2 continued with the high build quality of its predecessor but included several engineering improvements. The FM2n, an improved version, featured titanium honeycomb-pattern shutter curtains, enhancing durability and reliability. - **Nikon FM3A (2001-2006):** The FM3A combines the mechanical robustness of the FM and FM2 with more modern features. It includes a hybrid shutter mechanism and improved weather sealing, making it arguably the pinnacle in build quality among the three. # Shutter Speed: - **Nikon FM:** The FM has a mechanically timed shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/1000 of a second, plus Bulb mode. - **Nikon FM2:** The FM2 was notable for its then-revolutionary high shutter speed of up to 1/4000 of a second, made possible by the use of titanium shutter curtains. It also featured a flash sync speed of 1/200 sec, improved from the FM\'s 1/125 sec. - **Nikon FM3A:** The FM3A has a unique hybrid shutter mechanism that allows for both electronic and mechanical control, maintaining the 1/4000 sec top speed and 1/200 sec flash sync. This means it can still operate even without battery power at all speeds, unlike typical electronically controlled shutters. # Light Meter: - **Nikon FM:** The FM features a classic center-weighted light meter, operational from ISO 12 to 3200, requiring the user to manually adjust settings based on the meter reading. - **Nikon FM2:** Similar to the FM, the FM2 uses a center-weighted meter but with improved sensitivity and reliability. The metering range and the method of operation remained largely the same, emphasizing manual control. - **Nikon FM3A:** The FM3A introduced matrix metering (in addition to center-weighted metering) when used with AI-s and later type Nikkor lenses, offering more advanced and accurate exposure calculation than its predecessors. This was a significant upgrade, providing more support for achieving correct exposure in complex lighting situations. In summary, while all three cameras are celebrated for their build quality and manual control features, the FM3A stands out for its blend of classic mechanical reliability with modern conveniences like the hybrid shutter system and more advanced light metering options. The FM2, on the other hand, is particularly noted for its high shutter speeds and durable titanium shutter curtains. The FM serves as the foundation for what would become a lineage of respected cameras, offering ruggedness and reliability with a purely mechanical operation."},{"prompt":"their weights and ability to adapt pre ai lenses","completion":"The Nikon FM series cameras are not just known for their build quality and shutter mechanisms but also for their compatibility with a wide range of Nikon F-mount lenses. The weight of each camera and its compatibility with Pre-AI (Automatic Indexing) lenses are indeed important considerations for both collectors and users of these classic cameras. # Weights: - **Nikon FM:** Approximately 590g (body only). The FM is a compact and relatively lightweight camera, considering its durable metal construction. - **Nikon FM2:** Approximately 540g (body only for FM2n, which is the most common variant). Despite its robust construction, the use of titanium in the shutter curtains and other engineering improvements helped to reduce the weight slightly compared to the original FM. - **Nikon FM3A:** Approximately 570g (body only). The FM3A, while introducing more advanced features, maintains a weight close to its predecessors, balancing modern functionality with the classic feel of the series. # Adaptation of Pre-AI Lenses: One of the key considerations with Nikon F-mount cameras and lenses is the lens coupling system. AI (Automatic Indexing), introduced in 1977, allowed for full-aperture metering by having a ridge that couples with a feeler on the camera body. This system provides the camera with the lens aperture information necessary for proper metering. - **Nikon FM:** This camera was released after the introduction of AI lenses but was designed to be compatible with both AI and Pre-AI lenses. To mount a Pre-AI lens, the AI tab on the FM can be flipped up, allowing the lens to be mounted without providing meter coupling. The photographer would then need to use stop-down metering to determine the correct exposure. - **Nikon FM2:** Similar to the FM, the FM2 is also compatible with both AI and Pre-AI lenses. The process for using Pre-AI lenses involves flipping up the AI tab to mount the lens. However, it\'s essential to note that incorrect mounting of a Pre-AI lens without adjusting the AI tab could potentially damage the camera\'s meter coupling mechanism. - **Nikon FM3A:** The FM3A maintains compatibility with Pre-AI lenses while offering more advanced metering options with AI-s and later lenses. Like its predecessors, it allows the use of Pre-AI lenses with the same caution regarding the AI tab and the need for stop-down metering to achieve the correct exposure. In summary, all three cameras offer the flexibility to use a wide range of Nikon F-mount lenses, including Pre-AI lenses, by manually adjusting the camera\'s AI coupling tab. This feature makes them highly versatile for photographers who own or wish to use older Nikon lenses. The slight differences in weight among the models are generally less significant than their functional features and compatibility options, which have made them beloved by generations of photographers."},{"prompt":"compare the weight and weather sealing of the fm3a to the f2","completion":"The Nikon FM3A and Nikon F2 are both highly regarded in Nikon\'s lineup of film cameras, each belonging to different eras and designed for different segments of photographers. The Nikon FM3A was introduced in 2001 as the culmination of Nikon\'s manual focus, mechanical camera line, incorporating both mechanical durability and electronic sophistication. In contrast, the Nikon F2, introduced in 1971, was designed as a professional-grade system camera, succeeding the iconic Nikon F, and was known for its robustness and modular system that catered to the needs of professional photographers. Here, we\'ll compare their weight and weather sealing—a reflection of how technological advancements and market positioning influence camera design. # Weight: - **Nikon FM3A:** With batteries included, the FM3A weighs approximately 570 grams (body only). Its construction is robust, featuring metal components and a design that focuses on both durability and size efficiency. - **Nikon F2:** The F2\'s weight varies slightly depending on the specific model and the prism finder attached. The body alone, without the prism and batteries, weighs approximately 730 grams. With a standard DP-1 finder, the weight increases to around 990 grams. The F2\'s construction is predominantly metal, built to withstand the rigors of professional use, contributing to its heavier feel compared to the FM3A. # Weather Sealing: - **Nikon FM3A:** While the FM3A is built with a high level of craftsmanship and contains improved seals compared to its predecessors, it was not specifically marketed as being weather-sealed or waterproof. It does offer better resistance to dust and moisture than earlier models due to its design updates and tighter construction tolerances. - **Nikon F2:** Similarly, the Nikon F2 was not described in terms of modern weather-sealing standards at the time of its release. However, its construction quality, material choice, and design were aimed at professional use, including being used in demanding environments. The durability and build quality naturally provided a degree of protection against adverse weather, but like the FM3A, it was not considered weather-proof by today\'s standards. In conclusion, while both cameras showcase Nikon\'s commitment to build quality and durability, there are clear differences owing to their intended audiences and technological eras. The F2, designed for professional use in the field, is heavier and built like a tank, offering natural resistance to tough conditions despite the lack of modern weather sealing. The FM3A, while also robust, is lighter and incorporates more sophisticated technology with a nod towards enhanced durability, but without explicit weather sealing. Both cameras, with appropriate care, could handle a variety of shooting environments, but neither were designed with the extensive weather sealing found in many of today’s DSLR and mirrorless cameras."},{"prompt":"The world of sports and games","completion":"The world of sports and games is vast, encompassing a wide range of activities that people engage in for competition, leisure, fitness, and entertainment.

Development of rocketry technology by the Japanese continues during and after the Mongol-Japanese Wars, with indigenous Japanese gunpowder technology being combined with European smithing techniques and Sakuradite to create advanced weaponry. The Manchus in Han China still rise up in rebellion against the Mongolian occupation of Han China and [the Manchus in Han China] still [the Manchus in Han China] form the pre-Qing, post-1368, pre-1662 Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy/Islamic sultanate of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of post-Yuan China but the ethnic Korean military commander in Japanese controlled Korea, Yi Seong-gye, [Yi Seong-gye] is [Yi Seong-gye] killed in action while [Yi Seong-gye] fighting against Yuan forces retreating from the Manchurian Korean border and [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] thus [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] never founds the pre-1932, post-1897, Han Chinese-Korean Royal House of Jeonji Yi/Yi dynasty/Lee dynasty/House of Yi-ruled imperial absolute royal monarchy and satellite state/tributary state of the Ming of the Great Joeson State/Great Joeson/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Great Joeson Kingdom/Joeson Kingdom in this timeline, and thus Korea remains under Japanese rule until the modern day and beyond. The Ming and Japan engage in a Cold War with each other for who [the Ming and Japan] will dominate North Asia and Eurasia, with the Ming challenging the Japanese-controlled Silk Road and dominating the China region and the Japanese dominating the waves. The Ming and Japanese also compete over who is the true heir of the Han Chinese civilization created by the Han dynasty and who should be the leader of Islam within North Asia. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire\'s stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Leaving Asia for a little bit, the American Revolution success as in OTL and not in canon Code Geass but the Holy Roman Empire takes direct control of the newly independent USA . British loyalists in the USA flee to Canada. Japan in this timeline is [Japan in this timeline] this timeline\'s version of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled British Empire in exile known as the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Somalialand, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Pakistan, Bangladesh and India], Oman, Yemen, and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire\'s homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands] which [the Holy Brittanian Empire] is [Brittania] still formed when the British lose the Napoleonic Wars to the French Empire like in canon Code Geass. The 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial royal monarchy but de facto feudal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate that [the Tokugawa shogunate] ruled [the Tokugawa shogunate] over the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa that [the Meiji Restoration] abolished the rule of the shoguns and the feudal system over Japan and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty as a result of the Meiji Restoration] regaining executive control over the Japanese government and the subsequent formation of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Empire of Japan/Imperial Japan ruling over Sahlakin and the Kurils, Okinawa, the Marinas, the Carolinas, Palau and the Korean peninsula from [the Great Japanese Empire\'s home base] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Meiji Restoration] leading to the development of a democratic parliamentary system in Japanese politics and [the Meiji Restoration] paving the way for the industrial and military development that made Japan into a regional and then a world superpower in OTL, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [the Meiji Restorationin this timeline ] leads [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] to a compromise between the liberal, social democractic and progressive reformers who support the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] and the conservative, traditional aristocrats and merchants who support the de-facto Japanese royal family [the Tokugawa clan], with the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty still [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control over the Japanese government, but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan are [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] not [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] displaced [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] from their [the Tokugawa clan\'s reigning heads\'] role as shoguns [barbarian-killing generalissmos |shoguns|, the hereditary military dictators |shoguns| akin to the absolute monarchs of post-Rennissance Europe who |the shoguns| were the de-facto leaders of Japan during the period of feudal rule under the military dictatorship of the various shogunates of Japan from 1192-1868] but instead [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] becoming more akin to the Reichskanzlers [Realm Chancellors/Imperial Chancelors/Chancelors of the Realm |Reichskanzlers|] of the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire and the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire and the constitutional European royal monarchs of the post-Napoleon era. The buke/samurai are [the buke/samurai] not [the buke/samurai] abolished [the buke/samurai] along with the daimyō after the Meiji Restoration like in OTL, but [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] instead [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] being [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] into the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire, the Kazoku [\\"Magnificent/Exalted lineage\\" |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The Japanese still defeat the Great Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War of 25 July 1894 – 17 April 1895 but [the Japanese] have a stronger presence [the Japanese] in the Qing stronghold and homebase of Greater Manchuria unlike in OTL due to a more industrialized, developed and advanced combined armed forces of the Great Japanese Empire, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF\'s ground combat arm, the Imperial Japanese Army than in OTL. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution against the Great Qing Empire launched [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Nationalist, Han supremacist and Han expansionist secret society/political organization/militant group of the Tongmenghui, what will later become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, center to far right, Chinese nationalist, Chinese supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist nationalist revolutionary party/secret society/paramilitary group of the Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party |Kuomintang|] founded [the Kuomintang] by [the Kuomintang\'s founder] the Cantonese-Hakka medical student turned Han Chinese revolutionary, statesman and political theorist Sun Wen, [Wen] more popularly known as [Wen\'s more popular name] \\"Dr Sun Yat-Sen\\" in [when Wen founded the Kuomingtang] 1895 along with Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han monarchist and Han imperialist groups wishing to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming as the government of China, [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] remains steadfast in its [the Xinhai Revolution\'s] goal of [what the aim of the Xinhai Revolution was] \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\", which [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] meant [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] that [the meaning of the slogan \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\" during the Xinhai Revolution] the pre-1644, pre-Great Qing Empire, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled feudal imperial dynastic absolute dynasty royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\" would [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] be [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] restored [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] as the government [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] of Han China proper after the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire, with the stratocratic [military-ruled/military dominated |stratocratic|] Beiyang Government of the federal parliamentary presidental republic under military dictatorship of the first Republic of China ruling [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] over post Xinhai, post-Qing Han China never [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] a Republic [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] upon its [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] formation in [when the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China was |the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China| formed] on 10 March 1912 but [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] instead [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] always being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] the Empire of China formed by the top dog in the Great Qing Empire\'s combined naval, aeiral and ground combat forces, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang-ruled ROC\'s political establishment after the Xinhai Revolution and eventually first president of the first Republic of China, the Han Chinese Yuan Shikai on [when Shikai transformed the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the Empire of China] 12 December 1915 in OTL, with the Imperial House of Zhu being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] as the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu]. This [the Beiyang Goverment being formed as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] is [the Beiyang Government being |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] due to [why the Beiyang Government is |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] the influence of the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] has [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people, the pervasive influence of the Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies and organized crime syndicates known as the Triads, which [the Triads] are pervasive through Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi] and [the Triads] also have the goal of [the Triads\' goal] restoring the the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China despite their [the Triads\'] criminal activities and also to counter the influence of the charismatic leader of the Xinhai Revolution and subsequent founder of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist, semi-fascist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the toppling of the Great Qing Empire via the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent formation of the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the government of Han China, the Cantonese-Hakka doctor turned Han nationalist revolutionary and stateman Sun Wen, who [Sun Wen] is [Sun Wen] known as [Sun Wen\'s other name] \\"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen\\" outside Asia along with the desire of the Han Chinese people to emulate the Meiji Restoration, as well as Japan taking a more involved and direct role in [Japan] helping to [Japan] covertly support and [Japan] direct the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline. Due to Shikai never [what Shikai never does] proclaiming himself [Shikai] as Emperor of Han China like in OTL and the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] as the government [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline, [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu being |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| restored |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| as the government |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| of Han China after the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution [restoring the Ming to power in Han China after the overthrow of the Qing], the modern warlord era of post-Xinhai, post-Qing Han Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the vast majority of Han Chinese people supporting the restored monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and the reenthroned Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] ready [the Imperial House of Zhu] to [the Imperial House of Zhu] listen to the Han Chinese people\'s needs. Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China\'s peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China\'s peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation\'s] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China\'s peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China]. The descendants of the last emperor of the Great Ming State, Zhu Youjian, who [Youjin] had the era name of [Youjin’s era name] Chongzhen, and the last emperor of the Ming rump state of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, whose [Youlang’s] era name was [Youlang’s era name] Yongli being [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] are [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] merged [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] into a single imperial line [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] via multiple marriages, concubinages and adoption, although the marriage of Shikai\'s daughter to the last Emperor of the Great Qing State, the then young Aisin-Gioro Henry, whose [Henry\'s] era name was [Henry\'s era name] Pu-Yi, [the marriage of Shikai\'s daughter to Henry] as one of his [Henry\'s] wives continues and goes on despite Shikai never [what Shikai never does] crowning himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China. Shikai\'s reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai\'s] legacy and [Shikai\'s reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces within Han China from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC unlike OTL due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen\'s chosen successor and heir of his [Wen\'s] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen\'s other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the Empire of China and what would become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen\'s three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, then [the embyroic Nationalist China] under the rule of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" [The National Protection War] ends with the victory of the Empire of China over the embryonic Nationalist China due to Shikai never making himself [Shikai] Emperor unlike in OTL and [Shikai] instead returning the Zhu to power in China in this timeline, the Empire of China agreeing for Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede [Yunnan] from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC and [Yunnan] subsequently restore the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan\'s] government in exchange for Yunnanese support against the Chinese nationalists, and Cantonian independence activists and supporters in the Nationalist strongholds of Guangxi and Guangdong undermining the Nationalist war effort. A miscommunication between Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and his [Wen\'s] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria, which [Manchuria] during and after the Xinhai Revolution came under the rule of [what ruled Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Chinese warlord clique/military junta/government faction of the Fengtian Clique, [Manchuria coming under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] which [the Fengtian Clique] was [the Fengtian Clique] headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the ruler of the Fengtian Clique] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhuolin] known [Zhuolin] as \\"the Old Marshal\\" [Japan taking Fengtian Clique-ruled post-Xinhai Manchuria] and [Japan taking] Inner Mongolia as protectorates [of Japan], [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in post-Xinhai, post-Qing, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia. Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" is [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] killed [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] during the fighting and the Nationalist Chinese state headquartered in Guangdong and Guangxi essentially becomes a independent Cantonian republic after his [Wen\'s/\\"Yat-Sen\\"\'s] death due to Cantonese independence activists and [Cantonese] nationalists desiring a separate state from Han China taking over Nationalist China after his [Wen\'s/\\"Yat-Sen\\"\'s] death. Japan still gains Sahlakin and the Kurils during the Russian Civil War of 1917-1920, [Japan] still [Japan] making these areas [Sahlakin and the Kurils] into the Japanese province of Karufuto. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and the Beiyang Government\'s Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek\'s] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia\'s Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan\'s Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of post-Xinhai Han China unlike OTL. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day. The Beiyang Government is [the Beiyang Government] still [the Beiyang Government] Japanophilic and [the Beiyang Government] friendly to the West despite it [the Beiyang Goverment] being [the Beiyang Goverment] a modern incarnation [the Beiyang Government] of the Great Ming State in this scenario, with Japan still having good relationships with and a fair amount of control over the Beiyang Government. The Shōwa Restoration of February 26, 1936 in the Japanese Empire, [the Shōwa Restoration] also known as the February 26 incident, [the Shōwa Restoration] being [the Shōwa Restoration] organized [the Shōwa Restoration] by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers belonging to the ultranationalist secret society with the goal of reorganizing the Japanese state along totalitarian militarist lines and state socialism, the Cherry Blossom Society [the Shōwa Restoration being carried out] with the goal of purging the Japanese government andJapanese military leadership of their [the young officers\' carrying out the Shōwa Restoration\'s] factional rivals and ideological opponents, [the Shōwa Restoration being |the Shōwa Restoration| carried out |the Shōwa Restoration|] with the goal of restoring power to the then newly enthroned Japanese Emperor Shōwa [personal name Hirohito] and simultaneously abolishing the liberal Taishō democracy, with the Taishō democracy within the Japanese Empire being [the Taishō democracy] replaced [the Taishō democracy] a small group of qualified people backing up a strong Emperor, [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] succeeds [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] due to NKVD agent Richard Sorge being [Sorge] by the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai and the Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō and [Sorge] quickly neutralized, with the spy ring he [Sorge] had built in Japan being [Sorge’s spy ring] mopped up without the Soviets being anywiser and the Japanese domestic and foreign intelligence organizations being reorganized in order to prevent further breaches of security, [the mopping up of the Soviet spy ring in the Japanese Empire] preventing them [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] from [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] noticing [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] domestic threats within the Japanese Empire such as the Cherry Blossom Society. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War never happening, the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan all [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] survive [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] post-WW2 and post-1947 into the present day and beyond with Nationalist China surviving post-1949 into the present day and beyond. Brittania never conquers Japan unlike in canon Code Geass due to Japan in this timeline being [Japan in this timeline] stronger than in both real life and OTL and [Japan in this timeline] being [Japan in this timeline] the first nation [Japan in this timeline] to [Japan in this timeline] develop ICBMs and nuclear weaponry. The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units\' respective cockpits in the respective units\' prominent \'hump back\', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass] in the 1950s but the Kempeitai manages to steal the designs and specs for the Knightmare Frames and soon all of East Asia has its own Knightmare Frames thanks to the Japanese.","completion":"The arrival of the exiled Tang Dynasty figures and their supporters in Yamato initiates a transformative era for both the exiles and their new homeland. Fleeing from the turmoil and fragmentation of their native lands after the fall of their once-magnificent empire, these noble refugees bring with them not only their rich culture but also advanced knowledge and technologies. This confluence of cultures and ideas, sparked by the Tang exiles, propels Yamato into an unprecedented phase of innovation and expansion. **Year 618-907:** During this period, the Great Tang Empire, a fusion of Mongolian, Manchurian, Chinese, and Islamic cultures, thrives under the Imperial House of Li. It\'s a time of technological advancement, military prowess, and economic prosperity, bolstered significantly by the strategic utilization of the supermineral Sakuradite. This era also sees the Tang exerting considerable influence beyond their borders, establishing a formidable presence in trade and diplomatic relations across Asia. **Year 907:** The collapse of the Tang Dynasty prompts a massive exodus. The Imperial House of Li and its loyal subjects seek refuge in Yamato, forcing a dramatic shift in the region\'s political and cultural landscape. **Year 908-950:** The Tang exiles, employing their advanced technologies and knowledge, spearhead a mini-industrial revolution in Yamato. They also make significant efforts to spread Sunni Islam and their diverse cultural practices among the native peoples of the Japanese archipelago and Korea. The discovery of Sakuradite in Yamato further boosts these endeavors, as the exiles harness its power to strengthen their economic and military capabilities. **Year 951-1000:** The integration of Tang and indigenous technologies catalyzes the development of advanced weaponry, including early firearms. This period also witnesses the establishment of the Shogunate system, albeit with a unique twist — the position of Shogun is merged with that of Caliph, symbolizing the fusion of military and religious leadership under the Tang influence. **Year 1001-1200:** Amidst rising challenges from neighboring states and internal strife, Yamato solidifies its position as a dominant military and economic power in the region. The incorporation of the Eastern Roman Empire\'s \\"Greek fire\\" and advancements in rocketry technology further enhance its military prowess. Meanwhile, the complex intermarriage between the Imperial House of Li and native nobility creates a unique cultural and political tapestry within Yamato. **Year 1200-1279:** The attempted invasions by the Mongol Empire are thwarted, with Yamato maintaining control over Korea and leveraging these conflicts to advance its rocketry and gunpowder technology even further. **Year 1280-1368:** Yamato continues to grow in strength, establishing a protectorate system over parts of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. This period also sees a cautious but strategic engagement with the reinstated Ming Dynasty in China, as both states vie for dominance in North Asia. **Year 1369-1500:** As Yamato navigates its complex relationship with the Ming, it undertakes efforts to modernize and expand its military capabilities. The integration of Sakuradite into its industries and military apparatuses sets the stage for a new era of technological innovation and expansionism. **Year 1500-1600:** The influence of Yamato and the surviving Tang culture begins to wane as new power dynamics emerge in the region. However, efforts to retain cultural and political influences over its territories and beyond continue, emphasizing diplomatic engagements and selective military interventions. **Year 1600-1683:** The conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning and strategic marriages further entrench the mingled Tang-Yamato lineage and influence, reinforcing Yamato\'s claim to a unique heritage that melds distinct cultural and political legacies. **Year 1684-1800:** As global trade routes and alliances shift, Yamato adeptly navigates these changes, ensuring its continued prosperity and influence. The adaptation to new economic realities and the strategic exploitation of Sakuradite resources underpin its resilient position in the international arena. **Year 1801-1900:** The Meiji Restoration, influenced by Tang legacies, marks a pivotal point in Yamato’s history. The strategic compromise between traditionalist and reformist factions fosters a unique governance model that blends imperial control with broader societal participation, setting the stage for rapid modernization and the establishment of Yamato as a formidable global power. **Year 1901-1950:** Yamato\'s strategic alliances and military innovations, including the development of Knightmare Frames, redefine the balance of power in the region. Its role in international affairs grows, with diplomatic engagements and military prowess ensuring its status as a key player on the world stage. **Year 1951-Present:** In the modern era, Yamato stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of the Tang exiles. Its unique fusion of cultures, technologies, and governance models has molded it into a nation that, while distinct from its ancient predecessors, honors the depth and breadth of its heritage. The strategic use of Sakuradite continues to propel its economy and military, securing its place as a central figure in global geopolitics and a leader in technological innovation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A montage of images: The Great Wall of China, bustling Shanghai skyline, high-speed trains, crowded factories, and cutting-edge technology.] **Narrator:** \\"China, a civilization with over four thousand years of recorded history, has emerged as a global superpower. But how did the Middle Kingdom transform from a largely agrarian society into an economic and political powerhouse on the world stage? Today, we\'ll delve into the captivating journey of how China became so powerful.\\" [Cut to historical images of ancient China, emperors, and the Silk Road.] **Narrator:** \\"Our story begins in ancient times. China\'s history is marked by dynastic rule, beginning with the semi-mythological Xia dynasty around 2070 BCE, and sees the rise and fall of great dynasties like the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing. These periods were golden ages of culture, technology, and trade. The ancient Silk Road was not just a trade route but a symbol of China\'s early engagement with the world—exporting silk, porcelain, and tea.\\" [Transition to scenes of Opium Wars, old maps, and archival footage.] **Narrator:** \\"However, China\'s isolationist policies during imperial times and the impact of the Opium Wars in the 19th century led to a \'Century of Humiliation.\' Foreign powers imposed unequal treaties, ceded territories, and significantly influenced China’s sovereignty. This period deeply impacted the national psyche, fostering a resolve to return to greatness.\\" [Switch to footage of the Chinese Civil War, Mao Zedong, and early People’s Republic of China.] **Narrator:** \\"The fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912 and the subsequent decades of turmoil—marked by the Chinese Civil War and the invasion by Japan—culminated in the establishment of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949, under Chairman Mao Zedong. Despite significant social and economic reforms, Mao\'s era was also marked by policies like the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, which, while aiming to modernize the economy and society, led to economic disaster and the loss of millions of lives.\\" [Images display the opening to the world and economic reforms.] **Narrator:** \\"The turning point came in 1978, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, with the introduction of economic reforms. Moving away from a purely state-controlled economy, China opened its doors to foreign investment and technology. The establishment of Special Economic Zones was a catalyst for an economic boom. Thus began China’s unprecedented economic growth, averaging around 10% annually for nearly three decades.\\" [Cut to dynamic images of modern China: technology, big cities.] **Narrator:** \\"Today, China stands as the world\'s second-largest economy by nominal GDP and the largest by purchasing power parity. The \'Made in China\' label is ubiquitous, reflecting the country\'s status as the \'world\'s factory.\' However, China\'s economic model is evolving from labor-intensive manufacturing to innovation-driven industries, leading in areas like e-commerce, renewable energy, and high-speed railways.\\" [Video footage showing China’s role on the global stage: United Nations, foreign leaders with Chinese officials.] **Narrator:** \\"On the geopolitical front, China\'s influence has grown significantly. Through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, China is increasing its economic ties and infrastructure investments around the globe. Its role in international organizations has expanded, and it\'s now a central player in global diplomacy and environmental discussions, seeking to lead on issues like climate change.\\" [Images of domestic challenges, urban and rural life.] **Narrator:** \\"Yet, China\'s rise has not been without its challenges. Economic disparities between urban and rural areas, environmental degradation, an aging population, and concerns over human rights and governance remain pressing issues. Moreover, its rapid ascension has led to tensions with other global powers, raising questions about the future of international relations.\\" [Cut to a thoughtful narrator standing against the backdrop of a bustling Chinese city.] **Narrator:** \\"The story of China is one of resilience, reinvention, and resurgence. From the depths of historical humiliations to its current position on the world stage, China\'s journey is a testament to the enduring spirit of its people and their unwavering pursuit of development.” [Shift to a more reflective tone, with softer background music.] **Narrator:** \\"But what lies ahead for China? The country stands at a crossroads, with the eyes of the world watching closely. Will it navigate its domestic and international challenges to usher in a new era of prosperity and peace? Only time will tell.\\" [Video ends with scenes of Chinese landscapes, from mountains to urban areas, slowly fading to black.] **Narrator (Voiceover):** \\"Thank you for joining us on this journey through China’s remarkable transformation. The path has been complex and fraught with challenges, but the dragon’s ascent to global prominence is a narrative that continues to unfold, shaping the future not just for China, but for the entire world.\\" [Screen fades to black, ending with the message: \\"Like and Subscribe for more insightful documentaries.\\"] [End of Video Script] --- **Note**: This script is a simplified and broad overview meant for a general audience, blending historical, economic, and social elements to capture China\'s rise to power.

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

The Tang exiles also discover the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] among Yamato\'s geographical resources, [the Tang exiles] using it [the Sakuradite] to boost their [the Tang exile\'s] industrial, economic and military strength. Due to the rightful Chinese imperial government [the Great Tang Empire] being in exile [the Great Tang Empire] in Yamato, the Great Tang Empire\'s successor state of the pre-923 AD, post-937 successor state of the Later Tang ruling [the Later Tang] over much of Northern Han China is [the Later Tang in this scenario] simply an extension of the Tang government in exile in Yamato with ethnic Japanese and Korean soldiers from the conquered Yamato and Han Chinese, Hui, Mongolian and Manchurian soldiers of the Great Tang Army serving together against the Later Tang and the Great Tang Empire\'s enemies and the Great Tang Army utilizing Japanese and Korean war strategies against the warlords fighting in the China region. In defiance of the establishment of the post-960, pre-1279 Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Empire of the Great Song/Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" ruling [the Great Song State] over Han China, the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato decides to break off all ties with its [the Great Tang Empire\'s] home state [the China region] and [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declares itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] a separate state from the various dynasties ruling over the China region from Mongolia and Manchuria in its [the China region\'s] three thousand year history, [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declaring itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] to [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] have the eternal mandate of heaven combined with the ruling members of the Imperial House of Li\'s status as both Emperors of the Great Tang State and Sultans and Caliphs of the Great Tang Empire as a Sunni Islamic Sultanate [Great Tang Empire] under Sharia Law by divine right and birthright. Thus the evolution of Yamato into the modern nation-state known today as Nihon/Nippon [Land of the Rising Sun |Nihon/Nippon|] still continues like in OTL, albiet for a different reason. The ruling members of the Imperial House of Li and the Imperial House of Great Yamato become intertwined by concubinage, multiple marriages and adoptions to the point where the two houses become one, with similar events happening between the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty and the native Japanese and Korean nobility, aristocracy and nobility. The Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty still speak, write and think in Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish, believing these languages [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] to be the civilized tongues [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] of North Asia and Eurasia and viewing the Yue [Cantonese |Yue|] language spoken by Guangdong and Guangxi\'s native Cantonese people to be a barbarian tongue [Yue], and [Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty] promote the spread of these languages, especially Traditional Chinese, Mongolian and Manchu, among the people of Yamato, even though most of the ethnically Japanese and Korean native people of Yamato continue speaking and writing in Japanese and Korean The development of modern Japanese and Korean is heavily affected by these efforts by the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty however Japan\'s indigenous state religion, Shinto, becomes heavily influenced by the version of Sunni Islam practiced in the Tang Empire along with Han Chinese Daoist customs and Manchurian and Mongolian Shamanism. The development of Japanese Buddhism is also affected by the assimilation of the Tang exiles into Yamato as well. The Great Tang Empire\'s military flag, the San Chen, a red banner [the San Chen] with a large blue circle representing the Sun with [what the Blue Circle has] black rays in its [the San Chen\'s] center, with a smaller yellow circle representing the moon in the extreme left [of the black-rayed blue sun in the San Chen\'s center] is [the San Chen] combined with Yamato\'s and later Japan\'s shared naval jack and war banner of the Kyokujitsu-ki [Rising Sun Flag |Kyokujitsu-ki|] a white banner [the Kyokujitsu-ki] with [what the Kyokujitsu-ki has] a red disc representing the sun in its [the Kyokujitsu-ki\'s] center and sixteen red rays emanating from the disc [in the Kyokujitsu-ki\'s center], to form a new flag with the San Chen\'s black rayed sun with a yellow moon in the center of the Kyokujitsu-ki, although the yellow moon has [the yellow moon] [the yellow moon] the Imperial House of Great Yamato\'s/Minamoto dynasty\'s personal yellow chrysanthemum mom [Japanese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual, a family, or (more recently) an institution, municipality or business entity within Japan] in the center, with the yellow moon being darker to make the contrast between it and the chrysanthemum mom. The Great Tang Empire\'s unofficial naval jack, the Rì Qí [Sun Flag |Rì Qí|], a orange banner [the Rì Qí] with a red dot representing the Sun in the middle [of the Rì Qí], [the Rì Qí ]is [the Rì Qí] combined [the Rì Qí] with Yamato\'s and later Japan\'s civil banner, the Hinomaru [Ball of Sun |Hinomaru|], a white banner [the Hinomaru] with a red dot [representing the Sun] in the middle [of the Hinomaru] to form a new flag in the form of a orange banner with a white dot in the center [of the new flag] and a smaller red dot [in the center of the white dot]. This version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region eventually becomes seen as a separate state from China by the people of Asia and Eurasia, although it still tries to keep the Silk Road open and dominate Asian trade. The bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu\'s more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun\'s more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun and nominally to the emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], the collection of various powers that supported the shogunates and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke\'s other, more famous name] the samurai, and their subordinates is [the bakufu] still [the bakufu] established in 1192 in Japan however but the position of sei-i taishōgun is [the position of sei-i taishōgun in this timeline] combined with the position of Caliph inherited from the reigning members of the Imperial House of Li ruling over the Great Tang Empire in this timeline due to the influence of the Great Tang Empire on this version of Japan The integration of Tang industrial, military and trading efforts with what was taken from the Byzantines and Persia with indigenous Japanese skill and technology leads to the early development of firearms by the version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region. Japan sends both soldiers and military aid to both the Byzantines and the Muslims fighting against the Western European crusaders, learning both Byzantine, Western European and Arab Muslim technology and military tactics which are brought back to Japan to develop it [Japan] further. During the sack of the Eastern Roman Empire\'s capital of Constantinople in 12–15 April 1204 by the Crusaders, which lead to the temporary disintegration of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire\'s ruling imperial family, the Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine, instead take direct control of the Crusader controlled Eastern Roman successor state of the Latin Empire, [the Hapsburgs] ruling the Latin Empire and the Holy Roman Empire as a dual monarchy. The Eastern Romans never recover their empire unlike in OTL and according to myths later passed down in Japan in this timeline, the last Eastern Roman Emperor in this timeline, Alexios V Doukas, gave the position of Roman Emperor to the Japanese Emperors and stated that Japan in this timeline was the true heir of Rome to a Japanese military delegation helping the Eastern Romans fighting the crusaders. The Japanese do help refugees and military units from Eastern Rome to escape to Japan from the crusaders with the help of the Arabs and the Tang\'s old friend, the Persians, further strengthening Japan\'s already immense military and economic power. The Japanese also get the Eastern Roman Empire\'s secret weapon of \\"Greek fire\\", a incendiary chemical weapon [Greek Fire] made from petroleum manufactured in and used by the Eastern Roman Empire from the seventh through the fourteenth centuries When the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation\'s] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, both [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] attempt [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] to [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] invade Japan from 1274 and 1281, the invasion [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] still [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] fail, but Japan is [Japan] able to [Japan] hold onto Korea unlike OTL. Development of rocketry technology by the Japanese continues during and after the Mongol-Japanese Wars, with indigenous Japanese gunpowder technology being combined with European smithing techniques and Sakuradite to create advanced weaponry. The Manchus in Han China still rise up in rebellion against the Mongolian occupation of Han China and [the Manchus in Han China] still [the Manchus in Han China] form the pre-Qing, post-1368, pre-1662 Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy/Islamic sultanate of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of post-Yuan China but the ethnic Korean military commander in Japanese controlled Korea, Yi Seong-gye, [Yi Seong-gye] is [Yi Seong-gye] killed in action while [Yi Seong-gye] fighting against Yuan forces retreating from the Manchurian Korean border and [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] thus [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] never founds the pre-1932, post-1897, Han Chinese-Korean Royal House of Jeonji Yi/Yi dynasty/Lee dynasty/House of Yi-ruled imperial absolute royal monarchy and satellite state/tributary state of the Ming of the Great Joeson State/Great Joeson/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Great Joeson Kingdom/Joeson Kingdom in this timeline, and thus Korea remains under Japanese rule until the modern day and beyond. The Ming and Japan engage in a Cold War with each other for who [the Ming and Japan] will dominate North Asia and Eurasia, with the Ming challenging the Japanese-controlled Silk Road and dominating the China region and the Japanese dominating the waves. The Ming and Japanese also compete over who is the true heir of the Han Chinese civilization created by the Han dynasty and who should be the leader of Islam within North Asia. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire\'s stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Leaving Asia for a little bit, the American Revolution success as in OTL and not in canon Code Geass but the Holy Roman Empire takes direct control of the newly independent USA . British loyalists in the USA flee to Canada. Japan in this timeline is [Japan in this timeline] this timeline\'s version of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled British Empire in exile known as the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Somalialand, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Pakistan, Bangladesh and India], Oman, Yemen, and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire\'s homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands] which [the Holy Brittanian Empire] is [Brittania] still formed when the British lose the Napoleonic Wars to the French Empire like in canon Code Geass. The 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial royal monarchy but de facto feudal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate that [the Tokugawa shogunate] ruled [the Tokugawa shogunate] over the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa that [the Meiji Restoration] abolished the rule of the shoguns and the feudal system over Japan and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty as a result of the Meiji Restoration] regaining executive control over the Japanese government and the subsequent formation of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Empire of Japan/Imperial Japan ruling over Sahlakin and the Kurils, Okinawa, the Marinas, the Carolinas, Palau and the Korean peninsula from [the Great Japanese Empire\'s home base] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Meiji Restoration] leading to the development of a democratic parliamentary system in Japanese politics and [the Meiji Restoration] paving the way for the industrial and military development that made Japan into a regional and then a world superpower in OTL, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [the Meiji Restorationin this timeline ] leads [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] to a compromise between the liberal, social democractic and progressive reformers who support the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] and the conservative, traditional aristocrats and merchants who support the de-facto Japanese royal family [the Tokugawa clan], with the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty still [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control over the Japanese government, but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan are [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] not [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] displaced [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] from their [the Tokugawa clan\'s reigning heads\'] role as shoguns [barbarian-killing generalissmos |shoguns|, the hereditary military dictators |shoguns| akin to the absolute monarchs of post-Rennissance Europe who |the shoguns| were the de-facto leaders of Japan during the period of feudal rule under the military dictatorship of the various shogunates of Japan from 1192-1868] but instead [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] becoming more akin to the Reichskanzlers [Realm Chancellors/Imperial Chancelors/Chancelors of the Realm |Reichskanzlers|] of the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire and the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire and the constitutional European royal monarchs of the post-Napoleon era. The buke/samurai are [the buke/samurai] not [the buke/samurai] abolished [the buke/samurai] along with the daimyō after the Meiji Restoration like in OTL, but [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] instead [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] being [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] into the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire, the Kazoku [\\"Magnificent/Exalted lineage\\" |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The Japanese still defeat the Great Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War of 25 July 1894 – 17 April 1895 but [the Japanese] have a stronger presence [the Japanese] in the Qing stronghold and homebase of Greater Manchuria unlike in OTL due to a more industrialized, developed and advanced combined armed forces of the Great Japanese Empire, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF\'s ground combat arm, the Imperial Japanese Army than in OTL. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution against the Great Qing Empire launched [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Nationalist, Han supremacist and Han expansionist secret society/political organization/militant group of the Tongmenghui, what will later become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, center to far right, Chinese nationalist, Chinese supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist nationalist revolutionary party/secret society/paramilitary group of the Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party |Kuomintang|] founded [the Kuomintang] by [the Kuomintang\'s founder] the Cantonese-Hakka medical student turned Han Chinese revolutionary, statesman and political theorist Sun Wen, [Wen] more popularly known as [Wen\'s more popular name] \\"Dr Sun Yat-Sen\\" in [when Wen founded the Kuomingtang] 1895 along with Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han monarchist and Han imperialist groups wishing to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming as the government of China, [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] remains steadfast in its [the Xinhai Revolution\'s] goal of [what the aim of the Xinhai Revolution was] \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\", which [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] meant [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] that [the meaning of the slogan \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\" during the Xinhai Revolution] the pre-1644, pre-Great Qing Empire, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled feudal imperial dynastic absolute dynasty royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\" would [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] be [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] restored [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] as the government [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] of Han China proper after the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire, with the stratocratic [military-ruled/military dominated |stratocratic|] Beiyang Government of the federal parliamentary presidental republic under military dictatorship of the first Republic of China ruling [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] over post Xinhai, post-Qing Han China never [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] a Republic [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] upon its [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] formation in [when the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China was |the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China| formed] on 10 March 1912 but [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] instead [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] always being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] the Empire of China formed by the top dog in the Great Qing Empire\'s combined naval, aeiral and ground combat forces, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang-ruled ROC\'s political establishment after the Xinhai Revolution and eventually first president of the first Republic of China, the Han Chinese Yuan Shikai on [when Shikai transformed the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the Empire of China] 12 December 1915 in OTL, with the Imperial House of Zhu being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] as the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu]. This [the Beiyang Goverment being formed as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] is [the Beiyang Government being |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] due to [why the Beiyang Government is |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] the influence of the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] has [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people, the pervasive influence of the Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies and organized crime syndicates known as the Triads, which [the Triads] are pervasive through Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi] and [the Triads] also have the goal of [the Triads\' goal] restoring the the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China despite their [the Triads\'] criminal activities and also to counter the influence of the charismatic leader of the Xinhai Revolution and subsequent founder of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist, semi-fascist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the toppling of the Great Qing Empire via the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent formation of the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the government of Han China, the Cantonese-Hakka doctor turned Han nationalist revolutionary and stateman Sun Wen, who [Sun Wen] is [Sun Wen] known as [Sun Wen\'s other name] \\"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen\\" outside Asia along with the desire of the Han Chinese people to emulate the Meiji Restoration, as well as Japan taking a more involved and direct role in [Japan] helping to [Japan] covertly support and [Japan] direct the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline. Due to Shikai never [what Shikai never does] proclaiming himself [Shikai] as Emperor of Han China like in OTL and the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] as the government [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline, [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu being |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| restored |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| as the government |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| of Han China after the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution [restoring the Ming to power in Han China after the overthrow of the Qing], the modern warlord era of post-Xinhai, post-Qing Han Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the vast majority of Han Chinese people supporting the restored monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and the reenthroned Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] ready [the Imperial House of Zhu] to [the Imperial House of Zhu] listen to the Han Chinese people\'s needs. Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China\'s peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China\'s peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation\'s] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China\'s peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China]. The descendants of the last emperor of the Great Ming State, Zhu Youjian, who [Youjin] had the era name of [Youjin’s era name] Chongzhen, and the last emperor of the Ming rump state of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, whose [Youlang’s] era name was [Youlang’s era name] Yongli being [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] are [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] merged [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] into a single imperial line [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] via multiple marriages, concubinages and adoption, although the marriage of Shikai\'s daughter to the last Emperor of the Great Qing State, the then young Aisin-Gioro Henry, whose [Henry\'s] era name was [Henry\'s era name] Pu-Yi, [the marriage of Shikai\'s daughter to Henry] as one of his [Henry\'s] wives continues and goes on despite Shikai never [what Shikai never does] crowning himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China. Shikai\'s reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai\'s] legacy and [Shikai\'s reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces within Han China from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC unlike OTL due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen\'s chosen successor and heir of his [Wen\'s] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen\'s other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the Empire of China and what would become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen\'s three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, then [the embyroic Nationalist China] under the rule of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" [The National Protection War] ends with the victory of the Empire of China over the embryonic Nationalist China due to Shikai never making himself [Shikai] Emperor unlike in OTL and [Shikai] instead returning the Zhu to power in China in this timeline, the Empire of China agreeing for Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede [Yunnan] from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC and [Yunnan] subsequently restore the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan\'s] government in exchange for Yunnanese support against the Chinese nationalists, and Cantonian independence activists and supporters in the Nationalist strongholds of Guangxi and Guangdong undermining the Nationalist war effort. A miscommunication between Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and his [Wen\'s] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria, which [Manchuria] during and after the Xinhai Revolution came under the rule of [what ruled Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Chinese warlord clique/military junta/government faction of the Fengtian Clique, [Manchuria coming under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] which [the Fengtian Clique] was [the Fengtian Clique] headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the ruler of the Fengtian Clique] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhuolin] known [Zhuolin] as \\"the Old Marshal\\" [Japan taking Fengtian Clique-ruled post-Xinhai Manchuria] and [Japan taking] Inner Mongolia as protectorates [of Japan], [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in post-Xinhai, post-Qing, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia.

Japan still gains Sahlakin and the Kurils during the Russian Civil War of 1917-1920, [Japan] still [Japan] making these areas [Sahlakin and the Kurils] into the Japanese province of Karufuto. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and the Beiyang Government\'s Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek\'s] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia\'s Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan\'s Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of post-Xinhai Han China unlike OTL. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day. The Beiyang Government is [the Beiyang Government] still [the Beiyang Government] Japanophilic and [the Beiyang Government] friendly to the West despite it [the Beiyang Goverment] being [the Beiyang Goverment] a modern incarnation [the Beiyang Government] of the Great Ming State in this scenario, with Japan still having good relationships with and a fair amount of control over the Beiyang Government. The Shōwa Restoration of February 26, 1936 in the Japanese Empire, [the Shōwa Restoration] also known as the February 26 incident, [the Shōwa Restoration] being [the Shōwa Restoration] organized [the Shōwa Restoration] by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers belonging to the ultranationalist secret society with the goal of reorganizing the Japanese state along totalitarian militarist lines and state socialism, the Cherry Blossom Society [the Shōwa Restoration being carried out] with the goal of purging the Japanese government andJapanese military leadership of their [the young officers\' carrying out the Shōwa Restoration\'s] factional rivals and ideological opponents, [the Shōwa Restoration being |the Shōwa Restoration| carried out |the Shōwa Restoration|] with the goal of restoring power to the then newly enthroned Japanese Emperor Shōwa [personal name Hirohito] and simultaneously abolishing the liberal Taishō democracy, with the Taishō democracy within the Japanese Empire being [the Taishō democracy] replaced [the Taishō democracy] a small group of qualified people backing up a strong Emperor, [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] succeeds [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] due to NKVD agent Richard Sorge being [Sorge] by the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai and the Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō and [Sorge] quickly neutralized, with the spy ring he [Sorge] had built in Japan being [Sorge’s spy ring] mopped up without the Soviets being anywiser and the Japanese domestic and foreign intelligence organizations being reorganized in order to prevent further breaches of security, [the mopping up of the Soviet spy ring in the Japanese Empire] preventing them [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] from [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] noticing [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] domestic threats within the Japanese Empire such as the Cherry Blossom Society. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War never happening, the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan all [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] survive [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] post-WW2 and post-1947 into the present day and beyond with Nationalist China surviving post-1949 into the present day and beyond. Brittania never conquers Japan unlike in canon Code Geass due to Japan in this timeline being [Japan in this timeline] stronger than in both real life and OTL and [Japan in this timeline] being [Japan in this timeline] the first nation [Japan in this timeline] to [Japan in this timeline] develop ICBMs and nuclear weaponry. The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units\' respective cockpits in the respective units\' prominent \'hump back\', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass] in the 1950s but the Kempeitai manages to steal the designs and specs for the Knightmare Frames and soon all of East Asia has its own Knightmare Frames thanks to the Japanese.","completion":"In this alternate reality, the Great Tang Empire, once a dominant force over Han China, finds refuge in Yamato after their forceful evacuation. The Imperial House of Li, alongside loyal elements of the Tang Army, conquers these new territories, establishing an exile government that intertwines with the local Japanese and Korean societies. This unique combination of cultures sees the propagation of secular and religious practices like Sunni Islam and various East Asian traditions across Yamato, modern Nihon. Advanced technology from across the old world accelerates industrialization, with the discovery of Sakuradite bolstering the empire\'s might. The Tang government maintains connections with its historical territories through the establishment of the Later Tang dynasty as an extension of their rule, albeit from a distance. As time progresses, the Tang dynasty in exile redefines its identity, cutting ties with the China region and asserting its divine right to rule independently, blending the traditions of emperors and sultans under the banner of the Heavenly Mandate. Over generations, the Houses of Li and Great Yamato intertwine through marriage and adoption, merging cultures, languages, and traditions. The official languages of the Tang exiles promote the prestige of Eurasian lingua franca while inadvertently influencing the development of Japanese and Korean. Sunni Islam, alongside Daoist, Manchurian, and Mongolian shamanistic practices, begin to intertwine with local Shinto and Buddhist traditions, creating a unique religious fabric that permeates society. The military symbols of the Great Tang Empire and Yamato evolve into new national flags, representing the fusion of cultures under a single identity. The Bakufu system of governance is adapted, retaining its military roots while also incorporating Islamic administrative practices through the integration of the Caliph title with the Shogunate, symbolizing the amalgamation of military and divine rule. The intervention in global affairs, particularly the assistance to the Byzantines and engagement with the Mongolian invasions, showcases the military prowess and strategic depth of this new empire. Through these conflicts and alliances, Japan assimilates a wealth of knowledge, incorporating Greek fire and adopting rocket technology, further solidifying its status as a formidable power. The Ming dynasty and Japan enter a prolonged Cold War, competing for dominance over trade routes and cultural influence in Asia. This rivalry extends to the Qing dynasty, with both powers striving for supremacy through modernization and strategic expansion, including the annexation of territories and the establishment of puppet states in Korea and Taiwan. Foreign interventions and alliances shape the geopolitical landscape, with the Japanese empire taking an active role in supporting various factions during critical moments in history. The assassination of key figures and strategic marriages influence the direction of entire nations, redefining borders and allegiances across the continent. As the modern era unfolds, Japan, along with its associated states and territories, thrives as a unique amalgam of traditions, religious practices, and technological advancements. The restoration and transformation of governance, alongside strategic military and diplomatic maneuvers, position Japan as a leading power on the global stage, challenging conventional narratives of East Asian history and reshaping the balance of power through innovation and cultural synthesis. This alternate history presents a world where the fusion of distinct dynasties, cultures, and technological advancements creates a powerful and diverse empire that influences the course of world history, forever altering the fabric of East Asian society and its role in global affairs."},{"prompt":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息:

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

Chinese loyalists and supporters along with the Great Tang Empire\'s imperial family [the Imperial House of Li] with loyal elements of the Great Tang Empire\'s combined ground combat force and naval

subsequently conquering it [Yamato] and [the Tang exiles after |the Tang exiles| conquering Yamato] declaring a government in exile [of the Great Tang Empire] and [the Tang exiles after |the Tang exiles| conquering Yamato and establishing a Tang government in exile] utilize advanced technologies from Persia, Manchuria and Han China along with those brought over from the post-330 AD, pre-1453 Roman rump state of the absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy of the Eastern Roman Empire/\\"Byzantine Empire\\" ruling [the Byzantine Empire] over Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, the Balkans and the Caucuses in order to fund a primitive minature industrial revolution in their [the Tang exile\'s] new stronghold [Tang-conquered Yamato] while [the Tang exiles] also [the Tang exiles] trying to [what the Tang exiles try to do] spread Sunni Islam and Manchurian, Mongolian and Hui and Han Chinese culture among their [the Tang exiles\'] subjects [the native ethnic Japanese people of the Japanese Home Islands and the native ethnic Koreans of the Korean peninsula along with the Japanese in Korea] which is somewhat successful. The Tang exiles also discover the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] among Yamato\'s geographical resources, [the Tang exiles] using it [the Sakuradite] to boost their [the Tang exile\'s] industrial, economic and military strength. Due to the rightful Chinese imperial government [the Great Tang Empire] being in exile [the Great Tang Empire] in Yamato, the Great Tang Empire\'s successor state of the pre-923 AD, post-937 successor state of the Later Tang ruling [the Later Tang] over much of Northern Han China is [the Later Tang in this scenario] simply an extension of the Tang government in exile in Yamato with ethnic Japanese and Korean soldiers from the conquered Yamato and Han Chinese, Hui, Mongolian and Manchurian soldiers of the Great Tang Army serving together against the Later Tang and the Great Tang Empire\'s enemies and the Great Tang Army utilizing Japanese and Korean war strategies against the warlords fighting in the China region. In defiance of the establishment of the post-960, pre-1279 Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Empire of the Great Song/Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" ruling [the Great Song State] over Han China, the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato decides to break off all ties with its [the Great Tang Empire\'s] home state [the China region] and [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declares itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] a separate state from the various dynasties ruling over the China region from Mongolia and Manchuria in its [the China region\'s] three thousand year history, [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declaring itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] to [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] have the eternal mandate of heaven combined with the ruling members of the Imperial House of Li\'s status as both Emperors of the Great Tang State and Sultans and Caliphs of the Great Tang Empire as a Sunni Islamic Sultanate [Great Tang Empire] under Sharia Law by divine right and birthright. Thus the evolution of Yamato into the modern nation-state known today as Nihon/Nippon [Land of the Rising Sun |Nihon/Nippon|] still continues like in OTL, albiet for a different reason. The ruling members of the Imperial House of Li and the Imperial House of Great Yamato become intertwined by concubinage, multiple marriages and adoptions to the point where the two houses become one, with similar events happening between the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty and the native Japanese and Korean nobility, aristocracy and nobility. The Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty still speak, write and think in Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish, believing these languages [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] to be the civilized tongues [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] of North Asia and Eurasia and viewing the Yue [Cantonese |Yue|] language spoken by Guangdong and Guangxi\'s native Cantonese people to be a barbarian tongue [Yue], and [Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty] promote the spread of these languages, especially Traditional Chinese, Mongolian and Manchu, among the people of Yamato, even though most of the ethnically Japanese and Korean native people of Yamato continue speaking and writing in Japanese and Korean The development of modern Japanese and Korean is heavily affected by these efforts by the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty however Japan\'s indigenous state religion, Shinto, becomes heavily influenced by the version of Sunni Islam practiced in the Tang Empire along with Han Chinese Daoist customs and Manchurian and Mongolian Shamanism. The development of Japanese Buddhism is also affected by the assimilation of the Tang exiles into Yamato as well. The Great Tang Empire\'s military flag, the San Chen, a red banner [the San Chen] with a large blue circle representing the Sun with [what the Blue Circle has] black rays in its [the San Chen\'s] center, with a smaller yellow circle representing the moon in the extreme left [of the black-rayed blue sun in the San Chen\'s center] is [the San Chen] combined with Yamato\'s and later Japan\'s shared naval jack and war banner of the Kyokujitsu-ki [Rising Sun Flag |Kyokujitsu-ki|] a white banner [the Kyokujitsu-ki] with [what the Kyokujitsu-ki has] a red disc representing the sun in its [the Kyokujitsu-ki\'s] center and sixteen red rays emanating from the disc [in the Kyokujitsu-ki\'s center], to form a new flag with the San Chen\'s black rayed sun with a yellow moon in the center of the Kyokujitsu-ki, although the yellow moon has [the yellow moon] [the yellow moon] the Imperial House of Great Yamato\'s/Minamoto dynasty\'s personal yellow chrysanthemum mom [Japanese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual, a family, or (more recently) an institution, municipality or business entity within Japan] in the center, with the yellow moon being darker to make the contrast between it and the chrysanthemum mom. The Great Tang Empire\'s unofficial naval jack, the Rì Qí [Sun Flag |Rì Qí|], a orange banner [the Rì Qí] with a red dot representing the Sun in the middle [of the Rì Qí], [the Rì Qí ]is [the Rì Qí] combined [the Rì Qí] with Yamato\'s and later Japan\'s civil banner, the Hinomaru [Ball of Sun |Hinomaru|], a white banner [the Hinomaru] with a red dot [representing the Sun] in the middle [of the Hinomaru] to form a new flag in the form of a orange banner with a white dot in the center [of the new flag] and a smaller red dot [in the center of the white dot]. This version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region eventually becomes seen as a separate state from China by the people of Asia and Eurasia, although it still tries to keep the Silk Road open and dominate Asian trade. The bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu\'s more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun\'s more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun and nominally to the emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], the collection of various powers that supported the shogunates and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke\'s other, more famous name] the samurai, and their subordinates is [the bakufu] still [the bakufu] established in 1192 in Japan however but the position of sei-i taishōgun is [the position of sei-i taishōgun in this timeline] combined with the position of Caliph inherited from the reigning members of the Imperial House of Li ruling over the Great Tang Empire in this timeline due to the influence of the Great Tang Empire on this version of Japan The integration of Tang industrial, military and trading efforts with what was taken from the Byzantines and Persia with indigenous Japanese skill and technology leads to the early development of firearms by the version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region. Japan sends both soldiers and military aid to both the Byzantines and the Muslims fighting against the Western European crusaders, learning both Byzantine, Western European and Arab Muslim technology and military tactics which are brought back to Japan to develop it [Japan] further. During the sack of the Eastern Roman Empire\'s capital of Constantinople in 12–15 April 1204 by the Crusaders, which lead to the temporary disintegration of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire\'s ruling imperial family, the Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine, instead take direct control of the Crusader controlled Eastern Roman successor state of the Latin Empire, [the Hapsburgs] ruling the Latin Empire and the Holy Roman Empire as a dual monarchy. The Eastern Romans never recover their empire unlike in OTL and according to myths later passed down in Japan in this timeline, the last Eastern Roman Emperor in this timeline, Alexios V Doukas, gave the position of Roman Emperor to the Japanese Emperors and stated that Japan in this timeline was the true heir of Rome to a Japanese military delegation helping the Eastern Romans fighting the crusaders. The Japanese do help refugees and military units from Eastern Rome to escape to Japan from the crusaders with the help of the Arabs and the Tang\'s old friend, the Persians, further strengthening Japan\'s already immense military and economic power. The Japanese also get the Eastern Roman Empire\'s secret weapon of \\"Greek fire\\", a incendiary chemical weapon [Greek Fire] made from petroleum manufactured in and used by the Eastern Roman Empire from the seventh through the fourteenth centuries When the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation\'s] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, both [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] attempt [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] to [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] invade Japan from 1274 and 1281, the invasion [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] still [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] fail, but Japan is [Japan] able to [Japan] hold onto Korea unlike OTL. Development of rocketry technology by the Japanese continues during and after the Mongol-Japanese Wars, with indigenous Japanese gunpowder technology being combined with European smithing techniques and Sakuradite to create advanced weaponry. The Manchus in Han China still rise up in rebellion against the Mongolian occupation of Han China and [the Manchus in Han China] still [the Manchus in Han China] form the pre-Qing, post-1368, pre-1662 Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy/Islamic sultanate of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of post-Yuan China but the ethnic Korean military commander in Japanese controlled Korea, Yi Seong-gye, [Yi Seong-gye] is [Yi Seong-gye] killed in action while [Yi Seong-gye] fighting against Yuan forces retreating from the Manchurian Korean border and [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] thus [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] never founds the pre-1932, post-1897, Han Chinese-Korean Royal House of Jeonji Yi/Yi dynasty/Lee dynasty/House of Yi-ruled imperial absolute royal monarchy and satellite state/tributary state of the Ming of the Great Joeson State/Great Joeson/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Great Joeson Kingdom/Joeson Kingdom in this timeline, and thus Korea remains under Japanese rule until the modern day and beyond. The Ming and Japan engage in a Cold War with each other for who [the Ming and Japan] will dominate North Asia and Eurasia, with the Ming challenging the Japanese-controlled Silk Road and dominating the China region and the Japanese dominating the waves. The Ming and Japanese also compete over who is the true heir of the Han Chinese civilization created by the Han dynasty and who should be the leader of Islam within North Asia. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire\'s stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Leaving Asia for a little bit, the American Revolution success as in OTL and not in canon Code Geass but the Holy Roman Empire takes direct control of the newly independent USA . British loyalists in the USA flee to Canada. Japan in this timeline is [Japan in this timeline] this timeline\'s version of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled British Empire in exile known as the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Somalialand, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Pakistan, Bangladesh and India], Oman, Yemen, and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire\'s homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands] which [the Holy Brittanian Empire] is [Brittania] still formed when the British lose the Napoleonic Wars to the French Empire like in canon Code Geass. The 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial royal monarchy but de facto feudal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate that [the Tokugawa shogunate] ruled [the Tokugawa shogunate] over the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa that [the Meiji Restoration] abolished the rule of the shoguns and the feudal system over Japan and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty as a result of the Meiji Restoration] regaining executive control over the Japanese government and the subsequent formation of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Empire of Japan/Imperial Japan ruling over Sahlakin and the Kurils, Okinawa, the Marinas, the Carolinas, Palau and the Korean peninsula from [the Great Japanese Empire\'s home base] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Meiji Restoration] leading to the development of a democratic parliamentary system in Japanese politics and [the Meiji Restoration] paving the way for the industrial and military development that made Japan into a regional and then a world superpower in OTL, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [the Meiji Restorationin this timeline ] leads [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] to a compromise between the liberal, social democractic and progressive reformers who support the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] and the conservative, traditional aristocrats and merchants who support the de-facto Japanese royal family [the Tokugawa clan], with the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty still [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control over the Japanese government, but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan are [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] not [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] displaced [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] from their [the Tokugawa clan\'s reigning heads\'] role as shoguns [barbarian-killing generalissmos |shoguns|, the hereditary military dictators |shoguns| akin to the absolute monarchs of post-Rennissance Europe who |the shoguns| were the de-facto leaders of Japan during the period of feudal rule under the military dictatorship of the various shogunates of Japan from 1192-1868] but instead [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] becoming more akin to the Reichskanzlers [Realm Chancellors/Imperial Chancelors/Chancelors of the Realm |Reichskanzlers|] of the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire and the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire and the constitutional European royal monarchs of the post-Napoleon era. The buke/samurai are [the buke/samurai] not [the buke/samurai] abolished [the buke/samurai] along with the daimyō after the Meiji Restoration like in OTL, but [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] instead [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] being [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] into the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire, the Kazoku [\\"Magnificent/Exalted lineage\\" |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The Japanese still defeat the Great Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War of 25 July 1894 – 17 April 1895 but [the Japanese] have a stronger presence [the Japanese] in the Qing stronghold and homebase of Greater Manchuria unlike in OTL due to a more industrialized, developed and advanced combined armed forces of the Great Japanese Empire, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF\'s ground combat arm, the Imperial Japanese Army than in OTL. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution against the Great Qing Empire launched [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Nationalist, Han supremacist and Han expansionist secret society/political organization/militant group of the Tongmenghui, what will later become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, center to far right, Chinese nationalist, Chinese supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist nationalist revolutionary party/secret society/paramilitary group of the Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party |Kuomintang|] founded [the Kuomintang] by [the Kuomintang\'s founder] the Cantonese-Hakka medical student turned Han Chinese revolutionary, statesman and political theorist Sun Wen, [Wen] more popularly known as [Wen\'s more popular name] \\"Dr Sun Yat-Sen\\" in [when Wen founded the Kuomingtang] 1895 along with Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han monarchist and Han imperialist groups wishing to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming as the government of China, [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] remains steadfast in its [the Xinhai Revolution\'s] goal of [what the aim of the Xinhai Revolution was] \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\", which [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] meant [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] that [the meaning of the slogan \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\" during the Xinhai Revolution] the pre-1644, pre-Great Qing Empire, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled feudal imperial dynastic absolute dynasty royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\" would [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] be [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] restored [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] as the government [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] of Han China proper after the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire, with the stratocratic [military-ruled/military dominated |stratocratic|] Beiyang Government of the federal parliamentary presidental republic under military dictatorship of the first Republic of China ruling [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] over post Xinhai, post-Qing Han China never [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] a Republic [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] upon its [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] formation in [when the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China was |the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China| formed] on 10 March 1912 but [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] instead [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] always being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] the Empire of China formed by the top dog in the Great Qing Empire\'s combined naval, aeiral and ground combat forces, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang-ruled ROC\'s political establishment after the Xinhai Revolution and eventually first president of the first Republic of China, the Han Chinese Yuan Shikai on [when Shikai transformed the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the Empire of China] 12 December 1915 in OTL, with the Imperial House of Zhu being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] as the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu]. This [the Beiyang Goverment being formed as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] is [the Beiyang Government being |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] due to [why the Beiyang Government is |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] the influence of the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] has [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people, the pervasive influence of the Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies and organized crime syndicates known as the Triads, which [the Triads] are pervasive through Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi] and [the Triads] also have the goal of [the Triads\' goal] restoring the the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China despite their [the Triads\'] criminal activities and also to counter the influence of the charismatic leader of the Xinhai Revolution and subsequent founder of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist, semi-fascist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the toppling of the Great Qing Empire via the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent formation of the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the government of Han China, the Cantonese-Hakka doctor turned Han nationalist revolutionary and stateman Sun Wen, who [Sun Wen] is [Sun Wen] known as [Sun Wen\'s other name] \\"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen\\" outside Asia along with the desire of the Han Chinese people to emulate the Meiji Restoration, as well as Japan taking a more involved and direct role in [Japan] helping to [Japan] covertly support and [Japan] direct the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline. Due to Shikai never [what Shikai never does] proclaiming himself [Shikai] as Emperor of Han China like in OTL and the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] as the government [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline, [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu being |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| restored |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| as the government |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| of Han China after the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution [restoring the Ming to power in Han China after the overthrow of the Qing], the modern warlord era of post-Xinhai, post-Qing Han Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the vast majority of Han Chinese people supporting the restored monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and the reenthroned Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] ready [the Imperial House of Zhu] to [the Imperial House of Zhu] listen to the Han Chinese people\'s needs. Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China\'s peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China\'s peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation\'s] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China\'s peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China]. The descendants of the last emperor of the Great Ming State, Zhu Youjian, who [Youjin] had the era name of [Youjin’s era name] Chongzhen, and the last emperor of the Ming rump state of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, whose [Youlang’s] era name was [Youlang’s era name] Yongli being [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] are [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] merged [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] into a single imperial line [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] via multiple marriages, concubinages and adoption, although the marriage of Shikai\'s daughter to the last Emperor of the Great Qing State, the then young Aisin-Gioro Henry, whose [Henry\'s] era name was [Henry\'s era name] Pu-Yi, [the marriage of Shikai\'s daughter to Henry] as one of his [Henry\'s] wives continues and goes on despite Shikai never [what Shikai never does] crowning himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China. Shikai\'s reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai\'s] legacy and [Shikai\'s reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces within Han China from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC unlike OTL due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen\'s chosen successor and heir of his [Wen\'s] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen\'s other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the Empire of China and what would become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen\'s three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, then [the embyroic Nationalist China] under the rule of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" [The National Protection War] ends with the victory of the Empire of China over the embryonic Nationalist China due to Shikai never making himself [Shikai] Emperor unlike in OTL and [Shikai] instead returning the Zhu to power in China in this timeline, the Empire of China agreeing for Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede [Yunnan] from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC and [Yunnan] subsequently restore the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan\'s] government in exchange for Yunnanese support against the Chinese nationalists, and Cantonian independence activists and supporters in the Nationalist strongholds of Guangxi and Guangdong undermining the Nationalist war effort. A miscommunication between Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and his [Wen\'s] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria, which [Manchuria] during and after the Xinhai Revolution came under the rule of [what ruled Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Chinese warlord clique/military junta/government faction of the Fengtian Clique, [Manchuria coming under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] which [the Fengtian Clique] was [the Fengtian Clique] headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the ruler of the Fengtian Clique] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhuolin] known [Zhuolin] as \\"the Old Marshal\\" [Japan taking Fengtian Clique-ruled post-Xinhai Manchuria] and [Japan taking] Inner Mongolia as protectorates [of Japan], [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in post-Xinhai, post-Qing, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia. Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" is [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] killed [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] during the fighting and the Nationalist Chinese state headquartered in Guangdong and Guangxi essentially becomes a independent Cantonian republic after his [Wen\'s/\\"Yat-Sen\\"\'s] death due to Cantonese independence activists and [Cantonese] nationalists desiring a separate state from Han China taking over Nationalist China after his [Wen\'s/\\"Yat-Sen\\"\'s] death. Japan still gains Sahlakin and the Kurils during the Russian Civil War of 1917-1920, [Japan] still [Japan] making these areas [Sahlakin and the Kurils] into the Japanese province of Karufuto. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and the Beiyang Government\'s Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek\'s] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia\'s Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan\'s Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of post-Xinhai Han China unlike OTL. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day. The Beiyang Government is [the Beiyang Government] still [the Beiyang Government] Japanophilic and [the Beiyang Government] friendly to the West despite it [the Beiyang Goverment] being [the Beiyang Goverment] a modern incarnation [the Beiyang Government] of the Great Ming State in this scenario, with Japan still having good relationships with and a fair amount of control over the Beiyang Government. The Shōwa Restoration of February 26, 1936 in the Japanese Empire, [the Shōwa Restoration] also known as the February 26 incident, [the Shōwa Restoration] being [the Shōwa Restoration] organized [the Shōwa Restoration] by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers belonging to the ultranationalist secret society with the goal of reorganizing the Japanese state along totalitarian militarist lines and state socialism, the Cherry Blossom Society [the Shōwa Restoration being carried out] with the goal of purging the Japanese government andJapanese military leadership of their [the young officers\' carrying out the Shōwa Restoration\'s] factional rivals and ideological opponents, [the Shōwa Restoration being |the Shōwa Restoration| carried out |the Shōwa Restoration|] with the goal of restoring power to the then newly enthroned Japanese Emperor Shōwa [personal name Hirohito] and simultaneously abolishing the liberal Taishō democracy, with the Taishō democracy within the Japanese Empire being [the Taishō democracy] replaced [the Taishō democracy] a small group of qualified people backing up a strong Emperor, [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] succeeds [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] due to NKVD agent Richard Sorge being [Sorge] by the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai and the Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō and [Sorge] quickly neutralized, with the spy ring he [Sorge] had built in Japan being [Sorge’s spy ring] mopped up without the Soviets being anywiser and the Japanese domestic and foreign intelligence organizations being reorganized in order to prevent further breaches of security, [the mopping up of the Soviet spy ring in the Japanese Empire] preventing them [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] from [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] noticing [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] domestic threats within the Japanese Empire such as the Cherry Blossom Society. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War never happening, the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan all [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] survive [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] post-WW2 and post-1947 into the present day and beyond with Nationalist China surviving post-1949 into the present day and beyond. Brittania never conquers Japan unlike in canon Code Geass due to Japan in this timeline being [Japan in this timeline] stronger than in both real life and OTL and [Japan in this timeline] being [Japan in this timeline] the first nation [Japan in this timeline] to [Japan in this timeline] develop ICBMs and nuclear weaponry. The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units\' respective cockpits in the respective units\' prominent \'hump back\', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass] in the 1950s but the Kempeitai manages to steal the designs and specs for the Knightmare Frames and soon all of East Asia has its own Knightmare Frames thanks to the Japanese. N.B: Everything in this timeline takes place in chronological order.","completion":"In an alternate fabric of history, the once mighty Great Tang Empire, a synthesis of Mongolian, Manchurian, Islamic, and traditional Chinese elements, faced its demise. Fraught with internal strife and external pressures, the collapse of the empire forced the Imperial House of Li and their steadfast loyalists to seek refuge beyond their crumbling borders. The exodus led them to the land of Yamato, a realm under the dominion of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty. With a blend of tactics and technologies borrowed from the Byzantines, Persians, and their own rich heritage, the Tang exiles conquered Yamato, establishing a government in exile. This government, fueled by the discovery of the supermineral Sakuradite, embarked on a primitive industrial revolution, spreading their Islamic faith and East Asian cultures across the Japanese isles, reshaping the societal fabric. The liaison between the Imperial House of Li and the native Japanese House of Great Yamato birthed a new, intertwined aristocracy that held sway over this reborn Yamato, which continued its evolution into the modern nation-state of Nihon/Nippon. The amalgamation of both dynasties\' emblems produced new symbols of unity that represented this unique blend of cultures, traditions, and governance. As centuries unfolded, the Tang-influenced Yamato exerted its influence over Asia, leading to intricate relationships with neighboring states. The restoration of the Ming dynasty in China, through the Empire of China, marked a period of cold rivalry with Nihon, each vying for dominance in Asia. This rivalry, however, was tempered by shared interests and the emergence of external threats that occasionally forced alliances of convenience. The technological prowess of Nihon, enhanced by Sakuradite, saw advancements in military and industrial capacities that were unparalleled, leading them to aid distant allies and influencing global affairs indirectly. The sojourn of displaced Eastern Roman elements to Nihon brought with it the incendiary weapon \\"Greek fire\\", further bolstering Nihon\'s military might. Nihon\'s stoic resistance against invasions, first from the Mongol Empire and later from the Great Yuan, solidified its reputation as an impregnable fortress isle, fostering a sense of unity and national pride that propelled technological and military innovations. As the Ming and later the Qing dynasties rose and fell in China, Nihon navigated the tumultuous waters of international diplomacy, sometimes clashing with, sometimes supporting the various Chinese regimes in a perpetual dance of power politics that defined North Asia. The advent of the Meiji Restoration in Nihon brought with it a blend of tradition and modernity, allowing for a balanced governance model that saw the coexistence of the Emperor\'s authority with a bureaucratic system led by the Shogunate, adapted to fit the modern era\'s demands. The unique trajectory of Nihon\'s development, influenced profoundly by its inception as a Tang exile state, positioned it as a pivotal player on the world stage, serving as a bridge between the old world traditions of Asia and the emerging new world order marked by industrialization, modernization, and global interconnectedness. This alternate timeline witnessed a world where the fabric of history was woven with threads of what if, showcasing a realm where the legacy of the Great Tang Empire lived on through its descendants in Nihon, a powerhouse that charted its course through the annals of an alternate history, navigating the complex dynamics of power, culture, and innovation."},{"prompt":"Qu’est-ce qui pousse un homme te marier","completion":"Il existe de nombreuses raisons pour lesquelles un homme pourrait choisir de se marier.

Furthermore, insofar as Europeannation-states have continuously been urbanized over the last several decades, they have rapidly beenmetropolitanized, reinforcing pervasive and profound rescaling processes of decentralization and recentralization(Loughlin & Antunes, 2019), as the norm rather than an exception or anomaly, by which city-regional citizenship canno longer be envisaged as a homogeneous status exclusively bestowed by the nation-state. As such, city-regional cit-izenship is an essential constitutive dimension of the constitutional architecture of the nation-state (even contestingit) and is, consequently, demos-defining (Arrighi & Stjepanovic, 2019; Bollens, 2007).Upon agreeing to the principle of fixed territorial integrity and sovereignty in the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia,Europe invented the nation-state (Jordana, Keating, Marx, & Wouters, 2019). Tracing the beginning of“stateless-ness”to the decline of the nation-state (Ohmae, 1995), Arendt (1949) distinguished between nations and states. Anationreferred to a dominant group living in a bounded territory and sharing a culture, language, and history,whereas astatereferred to the legal status of the people living in a territory who are considered citizens with legalrights. Since the origin of the modern nation-state, there has been structural tension between the nation and thestate regarding which people are the“true”members of a nation—whether certain people living in a territory countas citizens with legal rights or are excluded and ignored as non-citizens (Marsili & Milanese, 2018). Arendt inferredthat no effective international or state mechanism existed to protect the rights of“stateless citizens”(Bernstein,2018). Arendt\'s observation resonates with the current European, metropolitanized, civic, stateless, and emancipa-tory city-regionalized nationalistic pattern (Calzada, 2018b) and, particularly in this paper, with the case of Catalonia,where, since 2010, a remarkable majority of Catalan citizens\' self-determination-consistent demands have not beenaccommodated thus far as a form of a properly framed“democratic politics”(Keating, 2019, p. 8) by examiningpotential and varied mechanisms to exercise the“right to decide”in Spain (Guibernau, 2013a; Centre d\'Estudisd\'Opinió, 2019). As such, the Spanish nation-state was established as a fixed, indissoluble, and homogeneous entitywith uniform attributes—particularly a set of fiercely enforced nation-state monopolies (e.g., defence and law) thatgave the government substantial control over the national destiny—and a narrow sense of citizenship, understood asthe legal bond between an individual and a state, that are familiar to us today. However, as Arendt anticipated, whatare then the implications of rescaling processes for city-regionalized and stateless citizens and their“right to vote”inthe current Catalonia (Kraus & Vergés, 2017; Piccoli, 2019; Stjepanovic & Tierney, 2019)?The literature on rescaling nation-states has explained that the fragmentation of the scale of the nation-state hasundermined the privileged position of the nation-state as the natural platform (Archer, 2012; Keating, 2013;Mykhnenko & Wolff, 2018). In turn, rescaling has allowed for the emergence of new forms of city-regionalized“stateless citizenship,”which is further invigorated, beyond other factors, by the limitations created by Spain thatrefrain the metropolitan hub of Barcelona in its global role (Jordana, 2019), where a“right to decide”has continu-ously been claimed (Crameri, 2015, 2016; Davidson, 2016; Generalitat de Catalunya, 2017; Guibernau, 2013b) andwhere“stateless citizenship”has manifested in grassroots demonstrations demanding a referendum on the futureform of a city-regionalized nation of Catalonia in reference to Spain and the European Union (EU) (Wydra, 2018).Paradoxically, the old European nation-state is apparently dying, but new states seem unable to be born under thesecircumstances (Bianchini, 2017; Calzada, 2015; Hepburn, 2008; Moisio, 2018; Scott, 1998). According to Jordana(2019), this gradual political reaction stemming from a perception founded on territorial abandonment by Madrid,provoking an emotional detachment with Spain, has forced the Spanish government to react (by any means)—even ifonly in terms of a determined refusal to grant any legitimacy or voice in support of secession. As a result, this paperargues that the Spanish nation-state is gradually being rescaled by Catalonia\'s“secession crisis”(Rodríguez López,Harguindéguy, & Sánchez Sánchez, 2019).CALZADA806This paper examines the nature and evolution of this“secession crisis”from two intertwining perspectives: (i)how the Spanish nation-state has been rescaled by this crisis since the Constitutional Court banned the Statute ofAutonomy in 2010 in a dispute that reflects the struggle between legal and democratic legitimacy and, as a result; (ii)how the metropolitan hub of Barcelona is increasingly shaping and invigorating this“secession crisis”by placing the“right to decide”(Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2019a), rather than secession itself (regardless of the outcome of ahighly unlikely referendum on independence), at the front of this debate. In the wake of the 2,286,217 Catalan citi-zens (43.03% of the Catalan census for this vote) who attempted to vote in the“illegal”referendum on 1 October2017, this paper presents two aims: first, to describe the complex context of the detachment by“stateless citizens”in light of the factual and combined data stemming from several sources. The second aim is to shed light on the fol-lowing main research question: is it feasible to accommodate the claims of Catalonia\'s“stateless citizenship”as away out of this“secession crisis”? (Moreno, Colino, & Hombrado, 2019; Stjepanovic & Tierney, 2019).This paper considers that this crisis in the Spanish nation-state has progressed to the point that it has become a“secession crisis”(Bartkus, 1999), provoking emotional detachment among a remarkable portion of Catalan citizenswho broadly represent various forms and attitudes and whom this paper defines as“stateless citizens”in Cataloniaas of 2010.“Stateless citizens”represent, as Jordana (2019) suggests, a singular and heterogeneous coalition of city-regional citizens in Catalonia who have been demonstrating regularly since 2010 (i) while being ignored by the Span-ish government; (ii) which has provoked their socio-political and metropolitan counter-reaction that is geopoliticallyfocused on Barcelona in pursuit of accommodating their further autonomy demands and the international project ofusing the global city by imagining a currentlyinexistentfederal or independent state in Europe as way out of the sta-tus quo and/or the increasing recentralization strategyin their existingSpanish nation-state. This singular coalition,essentially blending civic nationalism and secessionism, remains highly united due to three factors (Bollens, 2007;Jordana, 2019): (i) the perception of a unity from which all parties benefit; (ii) the shared self-perception of a coalitionwith regard to the attractiveness of a global city such as Barcelona; and (iii) a strong balance among political partiesand grassroots movements with heterogeneous political orientations but a common aim. These three factors lead usto conceive of“stateless citizens”as neither a purely nationalistic movement (despite strong civic features) nor amovement exclusively based on identity. Instead,“stateless citizenship”is considered a geopolitical and a city-regional civilian response that is spreading through the metropolitan hub of Barcelona while being driven by theglobal city through its support of the“right to decide”as a way to internationalize the self-determination“right tothe city”in a hyper-globalized and multipolar realm (Fukuyama, 2018; Smith, 2019; Tamir, 2019).“Stateless citizenship”is operationally defined (using factual evidence and empirical data in tables and figures andoperationalizing the main research question throughout the paper, as depicted in Table 1) as those Catalan citizenswho are somehow randomly represented by these (not mutually exclusive) six ongoing contextual factors that arecharacterized by a complex metropolitan driver and a political claim in the awake of the Catalan grassroots secessiondecision on 10 July 2010 in Barcelona: (i) 62% of Catalan citizens believe that Catalonia deserves to develop alterna-tive accommodation mechanisms such as either an independent state or a state in federal Spain (according to the 1stwave of March 2019; Centre d\'Estudis d\'Opinió, 2019) (Figure 1); (ii) 65% of Catalan citizens are willing to furtherexplore ways to increase devolution in Catalonia (Centre d\'Estudis d\'Opinió, 2019) (Figure 2); (iii) 48% of Catalan citi-zens demonstrate widespread social support for independence through their continuous active participation in grass-roots demonstrations since 2010 (Centre d\'Estudis d\'Opinió, 2019) (Figure 3); (iv) 2,286,217 Catalan citizensattempted to vote on the“illegal”and“constitutive referendum”on 1 October 2017 (Generalitat de Catalunya,2019) (Table 2); (v) Catalan citizens voted for political parties favourable to the“right to decide”(which is understoodas the right to vote in a referendum) with representation in the regional and local elections (61% of the MPs in Bar-celona City Council\'s Parliament after local elections on 26 May 2019 and 58% of the MPs in the Parliament of Cata-lonia after regional elections on 21 December 2017) (Figure 4); and ultimately, (vi) 78.7% of Catalan citizens agreethat Catalans have the“right to decide”their own future as a country/nation voting in a referendum (Centred\'Estudis d\'Opinió, 2019) (Figure 5). The data and evidence presented in this article corresponds to the evolutionCALZADA807until the 1st Wave 2019 (March 2019; Centre d\'Estudis de\'Opinio, 2019) published by the d\'Estudis d\'Opinió afterthe fieldwork that was carried out by Gabinet d\'Estudis Socials i Opinió Pública (GESOP), SL, from 4 to 25 March2019.This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the rationale by which rescaling has been invigorated since2010, which is manifested by the“right to decide”grassroots demonstrations and backed by an increasing politicalattitude demanding the exercise of consultation on the matter of secession. Section 3 highlights the metropolitannature of Barcelona alongside its global city role in this“secession crisis.”Section 4 concludes that, at present, withthe analysed factors in this paper, it is hardly feasible for the Spanish nation-state to accommodate Catalonia\'s“stateless citizenship.”2|RATIONALE: THE“RIGHT TO DECIDE”DEBATE AS THE UPDATEDVERSION OF THE“RIGHT TO THE CITY”IN SECESSIONISMAccording to Keating (2013, p. 6), nation-state rescaling can be defined as the“migration of economic, social, andpolitical systems of action and of regulation to new spatial levels above, below, and across the nation-state.”Theforms and functions of the nation-state have been displaced upwards (to supranational bodies), downwards (toregional, metropolitan, and urban bodies) and sideways (to non-state agencies). As the mutual correspondence of thestate, the governing order, the economy, society, and identity can no longer be taken for granted, in this paper, ITABLE 1Operationalizing the main research question: Is it feasible to accommodate Catalan“StatelessCitizenship”in the Spanish nation-state?FactorsMetricsFactual evidences and empirical data(1) Political Opinion on:Accommodation,Devolution, andSecession (Source:Centre d\'Estudisd\'Opinió, 2019)Potential accommodationmechanisms in relation to Spain1.1.

In the case of Catalonia, a stress on the rights of the individual—instead of traditionalethnic nationalistic features—has always appeared in the slogans circulating on social media (Arrighi &Stjepanovic, 2019; Crameri, 2016) regarding the Catalan National Assembly (Assemblea Nacional Catalana,ANC;www.assemblea.cat) andÓmnium Cultural(OC; www.omnium.cat) civil pro-independence movements. Thus,“stateless citizenship”in Catalonia is phrased as a desire for independence (or feasible federal accommodations)stemming from the right of the moral autonomy of the individual, which not only downplays group membershipbut also reinforces the argument that each Catalan citizen should have the democratic right to peacefully vote onthe way forward.Hence, the metropolitan root of the political expression of the“right to decide”can be viewed as a new versionof a metropolitan-based“right to the city”beyond nation-states. Thus, ademos-driven, self-determination 2.0 versionempowered by a wide range of political ideologies around a“civic nationalist”peaceful movement activates a bot-tom-up and progressivist city-regional political response in Catalonia (Keating, 2019). The push for the“right todecide”in Catalonia cannot entirely be explained without the metropolitan hub of Barcelona and its pursuit of anexplicit and self-conscious sense of metropolitan belonging that renews the idea of the“right to the city”(Harvey,2008; Lefebvre, 1968). In this interpretation (Calzada, 2018b), the civic quest for political-democratic ownership ofthe metropolis is extended to“stateless citizenship.”Moreover, rescaling has caused new social and political cleavages between subnational levels in the Spanishnation-state based on the metropolitan push by secessionist social movements operating simultaneously by over-lapping at a number of different scales (urban, metropolitan, and city-regional) (Bauböck, 2019; Calzada, 2017). Con-sequently, a city-regionalized“stateless citizenship”has been fuelled by“civic nationalism”rooted in themetropolitan“right to decide”(as an updated version of the principle of the“right to the city”) and bolstered by themetropolitan hub of Barcelona through an increasing push by grassroots movements such as the ANC and OC. How-ever, before the ongoing re-emergence period of Catalan secessionism, authors such as Miley (2007) advocatedagainst the thesis of Catalonia as a“civic nation.”As Miley stated, as a counterargument to the previous trend—andin opposition to exercising the“right to decide”through referendum and consultation so as to defend fixed state-ter-ritorial integrity stemming from the Westphalian order of the club of nation-states and from the principle of the“empire of law”—state-centric“ethnic nationalistic”expressions with different rationales have recently (re-)emergedand are embodied by the liberal, conservative, and far-right Spanish political parties: the Citizens\' Party (Ciudadanos,the Cs), the Popular Party (Partido Popular,PP), andVox(Billig, 1995).Against this backdrop, in Catalonia, the regimes of self-government and devolution accommodation providedby Spain continue to be perceived as insufficient by a large share of Catalan (and Barcelonese) society (Figure 2),resulting in further tensions among territorial statehood, the spaces of historical identity, and future secessionistaspirations (Mulle & Serrano, 2018; Rodríguez López et al., 2019). One means by which Spain can relieve this ten-sion is to seek outright independence to reconcile the spaces of identity and statehood of Catalonia\'s small city-regionalized nation through referenda, as occurred in Scotland in 2014 (Arrighi, 2019; Qvortrup, 2014). Never-theless, Cetrà and Harvey (2018, p. 1) predicted that“independence referendums will continue to be rareevents.”The hypothesis of this paper focuses on the link among civic nationalism, secessionism, and the emancipatoryrole of cities (and city-regions) through the claims of the“right to decide”, as noted by Berlin (1996, p. 252), whostated that“nationalism springs, as often as not, from a wounded or outraged sense of human dignity, the desire ofrecognition.”Moreover, Guibernau (2013a, p. 411) defines the“right to decide”as“the right by citizens of the nationto defend and exercise, through referenda and consultation, their right to be recognized as ademosable to decideupon their political destiny triggered by their desire to share a common fate.”This paper depicts the evolution ofsecessionism in Catalonia and Barcelona, which complement each other and are characterized by a demand made byCALZADA810considerable portions of the Catalan and Barcelonese populations to hold a referendum and, according to recentdata in March 2019, favour secession (Keating, 2019; Tamir, 2019). According to Figure 3, judging from the evolutionsince March 2015 until March 2019, the disparity over the time among those in favour of and against to the idea of“Catalonia becoming an independent State”is higher in Barcelona than in Catalonia, which suggests that gaining orlacking metropolitan support will establish the future directions of devolution debates (Calzada, 2018b). However, itremains to be seen: (i) whether it is feasible to accommodate a referendum claim and effective secession through therealization of an independent state in the EU (or at least a federal state in Spain) (Guinjoan & Rodon, 2016; Jordanaet al., 2019; Rico, 2016); or (ii) whether there is room for another type of experimental and federal pathway inEurope, as long as citizens\' geodemocratic rights to remain in the former nation-state or to secede are ensured (Cal-zada, 2018a).FIGURE 2Factor“political opinion on devolution”and the metric of favourable/unfavourable towards further“devolution”(1.2)Source:Centre d\'Estudis d\'Opinió (2019) (Q32)CALZADA8113|DISCUSSION: IS IT FEASIBLE TO ACCOMMODATE CATALAN“STATELESS CITIZENSHIP”IN THE SPANISH NATION-STATE?Despite being located at the geographic periphery, according to the centralistic mindset of Madrid\'s elites (Ehrlich,1997), Catalonia has often held a central position in Spanish politics. According to Jordana, since the nineteenth cen-tury, Barcelona has been one of the most advanced and modern cities in Spain (Jordana, 2019; Jordana et al., 2019).This modernity stemmed from the success of the broad“Catalanist”movement, which, over time, has almost alwayssimultaneously housed autonomists, federalists, confederalists, and pro-independentists but, in recent years, hastransitioned collectively (despite not hegemonically) towards a singular and heterogeneous coalition in favour of the“right to decide”(Guibernau, 2013b). This historical goal of mainstream“Catalanism”consisted of securing accommo-dations within Spain combined with direct participation in the EU. However, this accommodation has resulted in anunstable equilibrium: since 2010, this increasing support for the“right to decide,”rather than secession itself, hasbecome sufficiently widespread to force the Spanish government to fiercely react to Catalan demands in terms of afixed position rooted in constitutional legality.Although the starting point of Catalan grassroots mobilization could be situated in 2010, the first milestonemust be located in 2006: The updated Catalan Statute of Autonomy came into force and was approved in theFIGURE 3Factor“political opinion on secession”and the metric of favourable/unfavourable towards“secession”(1.3)Source: Centre d\'Estudis d\'Opinió (2019) (Q34)CALZADA812Catalan and Spanish Parliaments and by a referendum in Catalonia. However, the turnout for this approval failedto reach 50%, indicating public apathy towards the statute and reflecting the top-down nature of the reform pro-cess itself. Furthermore, in June 2010, the Constitutional Court declared several articles of the statute regardingthe consideration of Catalonia as a nation to be unconstitutional. This decision set Catalonia onto the pathway ofsecessionist politics: One month later, on 10 July 2010, as a socio-political and metropolitan reaction to this legaldecision, a massive demonstration in Barcelona took place under the motto“We are a nation, we decide.”Consol-idating this trend, on Catalonia\'s national holiday on 11 September 2012, another demonstration in Barcelonaorganized by OC took place; using the explicit motto“Catalonia, a new state in Europe,”this demonstration mar-ked the symbolic beginning of the independence referendum campaign, which continues to this day (Colomer,2017; Cuadras-Morató, 2016). The 1.5 million citizens who demonstrated in Barcelona in favour of self-determi-nation on 11 September 2012—and on many occasions thereafter—illustrate the strength of the civic/metropolitanized nationalistic movement that favours dissolving the concept of a singledemosby overcoming theethnic nature of citizenship, thus blending Spanish and Catalan identities with the opportunity to democraticallyvote in favour of or against independence. In contrast, the accommodation of such democratic claims directlychallenges the position of a large majority of Spanish public opinion by depicting a clear asymmetric perceptionbetween the Spanish and the Catalonian as well as the political class in the Spanish central government, whoinsist that the constitutional provisions supporting centralism are non-negotiable. Moreover, stressing this coun-ter-reaction to the Catalan“secession crisis,”on 12 February 2019, the long-awaited trial of twelve Catalan sepa-ratist leaders subject to up to 25 years of imprisonment on charges of rebellion andmisuse of public funds fortheir role in the“illegal”referendum that took place on 1 October 2017 began in the Spanish Supreme Court. Par-alleling this long process, the emergent far-rightin Spain (Billig, 1995), embodied by the new partyVox,hascapi-talized on the secessionist backlash byre-introducing Franco-era discourses and analogies to the Spanish nation-state and achieving representation in the Spanish parliament for the first time, which is likely to even furtheraccelerate the inner systemic conflict by exacerbating the rescaling process in Spain.To briefly summarize the socio-political unrest and the civilian mobilization in response to it, Barcelona witnessedfour main milestones as the principal strategic steps in the long Catalan secession process (Harguindéguy, SolaRodríguez, & Cruz Díaz, 2018): (i) on 9 November 2014, a non-binding self-determination referendum was organized;(ii) on 27 September 2015, a plebiscitary election with a unity list in favour of“yes”was announced yet did notobtain a majority of votes but did obtain a majority of MP seats (Martí & Cetrà, 2016); (iii) on 1 October 2017, the“illegal”and“constitutive referendum”was held; and (iv) on 27 October 2017, a unilateral and“symbolic”declarationof independence took place (Cetrá, Casanas-Adam, & Tárrega, 2018).In Barcelona, the claim for independence has continued since the Statute of Autonomy was first approved by theCatalan regional parliament in 2006, which was later rejected by the Constitutional Court in what was interpreted asan act of aggression not only by the main Catalan nationalistic parties but also by proponents of other federalist (notlikely to be in favour of full independence) options merely demanding respect for the sovereignty of the Catalan par-liament and a say in the future of the city-region.As the highpoint of this process, on 1 October 2017, the referendum on Catalan independence prompted scenesof police violence that were broadcast all over the world and that were followed by the declaration of independenceby the Catalan regional government, which has been the turning point not only for politics in Catalonia but also forthe balance of power among Spanish political parties and, more broadly, the internationalization of this political con-flict rooted in secessionism and claims for devolution through the“right to decide”(Table 2). However, this paperargues that this case is about more than Catalonia itself. The events taking place reflect a battle between two ver-sions of Spain, and the competition between them appeared to have been resolved during the transition from dicta-torship to democracy in the late 1970s. Therefore, as many Spaniards had long suspected, it turns out that thememories of the Civil War of 1936 to 1939 have not been laid to rest. According to Figures 1 and 2, despite the factthat there are other options besides independence and recentralization, the evolution in both Catalonia and the met-ropolitan province of Barcelona shows a willingness to achieve further autonomy through the“right to decide.”CALZADA813Furthermore, the local (26 May 2019), general (28 April 2019), and regional election (21 December 2017) resultshave shown that Catalonia and Barcelona are not particularly aligned with the Spanish nationalistic view representedby PP, Cs, as well as the far-rightVox(Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2019b). Actually, consistently, 61%, 58%, and 60%of the representatives, elected through the respective elections (local, regional, and general), favour the“right todecide.”The cause of Catalan independence could be viewed as the catalyst for the recent upheavals, not as theunderlying reason for the re-emergence of the most extreme version of ethnic state-centric nationalistic expressionembodied by the new far-right partyVox(Billig, 1995).Consequently, this paper argues that the claim for the“right to decide”in Barcelona and, by extension, inCatalonia, has been consistent since 10 July 2010, due to official support continuously being manifestedthrough regional and city council parliamentary elections as well as the crowded grassroots demonstrations reg-ularly occurring in the metropolitan province of Barcelona. Of course, self-determination does not necessarilymean secession; it simply means being able to decide whether to secede (Stjepanovic, 2018). The newly electedradical-left mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau (BComú), appears cautiously ambivalent in confronting this debate,while Barcelona remains trapped in the city-regional/metropolitan territory. Colau openly supports the popularreferendum to implement the“right to decide”while also taking no clear position on Catalan independence.And in line with this and in contrast to widespread perceptions, the majority of the current Catalan regionalparliament (58% of MPs) and the majority of the city council parliament in Barcelona (61% of representatives)favour the exercise of the“right to decide”(Calzada, 2018b) (Figure 4). For most Catalans, regardless ofwhether they favour independence, the principle that they should be able to vote on their status vis-à-vis Spainhas become the embodiment of the meaning of democracy in the current“secession crisis”(Crameri, 2015). Tofurther illustrate this support, a platform called www.somel80.cat (“We Are the 80% Platform”) has recentlybeen set up to point out that the majority of the residents of Catalonia (78.7%, according to the latest Baròme-ter published result in March 2019; Figure 5) enjoy a high level of agreement regarding: (i) the defence ofessential democratic rights and freedoms; (ii) the rejection of repression and the use of the criminal justice sys-tem as a tool to resolve political conflicts; and (iii) the defence of a political solution that must always allowthe residents of Catalonia to decide and democratically determine their political future. Therefore, the platformadvocates the“right to decide”for the majority of the Catalan society that could be represented in terms ofnon-recognized“stateless citizenship”in the EU. Despite legal considerations, as Arendt anticipated, the rightsof 2,286,217 Catalan“stateless citizens”in the EU who voted in the“illegal”referendum on 1 October 2017may not presently be protected or recognized. Unsurprisingly, through civil movements and protests, the Cata-lan republican movement has spurred a transformation of the sense of the metropolitan“right to the city”intothe sense of belonging to civic republican and nationalistic conceptions of democracy in which democracy isconceived of as a participatory, inclusive, and deliberative form of government in line with EU values.TABLE 2Factor“direct democracy, constitutive referendum, and grassroots/social mobilization”and the metricof favourable/unfavourable towards secession (2.1.): outcome of the“illegal”and“constitutive referendum”on 1October 2017TurnoutVotesResultsCensus Voters%Validated Null YES%NO% White %Catalonia5,313,564 2,286,217 43.03 2,266,498 19,719 2,044,038 90.18 177,547 7.83 44,913 1.98MultilevelBarcelona(Bauböck,2019)Provincial3,971,666 1,637,401 41.23 1,622,139 15,262 1,438,682 88.69 147,294 9.08 36,163 2.23Metropolitan 3,605,651 1,425,607 39.54 1,411,409 14,198 1,239,232 87.80 138,759 9.83 33,418 2.37Urban1,570,607 564,321 35.93 557,930 6,391 486,131 87.13 55,477 9.94 16,322 2.93Municipal1,136,354 446,388 39.28 441,237 5,151 389,777 88.33 37,975 8.60 13,485 3.05Source:Generalitat de Catalunya (2019)CALZADA814\\"\\"","completion":"Resumen Profesional: El artículo de Igor Calzada examina el complejo proceso de redimensionamiento del Estado-nación español a través del prisma de la crisis de secesión en Cataluña, especialmente después del referéndum considerado \\"ilegal\\" el 1 de octubre de 2017. Con un enfoque específico en la ciudad de Barcelona y los movimientos ciudadanos desde el 10 de julio de 2010, Calzada argumenta que, actualmente, no es viable para el Estado español acomodar la \\"ciudadanía sin estado\\" de Cataluña, un fenómeno que se intensificó tras el rechazo del Estatuto de Autonomía catalán en 2010. El análisis proporciona una visión profunda sobre cómo los desafíos escalares urbanos, regionales y nacionales están redefiniendo las nociones de ciudadanía, pertenencia, y autogobierno en el contexto europeo contemporáneo. Puntos Clave: - **Crisis de Secesión Catalana:** El artículo rastrea el desarrollo de la crisis secesionista de Cataluña desde el masivo movimiento ciudadano de julio de 2010, exacerbado por eventos significativos como el referéndum de independencia de 2017. A través de estos eventos, se revela un creciente apoyo hacia la secesión, subrayando una crisis territorial y de identidad dentro de España. - **Ciudadanía Sin Estado:** Cataluña ha experimentado un proceso de desidentificación con el concepto tradicional de la nación-estado española, buscando formas de autogobierno y definición identitaria fuera de las estructuras estatales establecidas. Estas dinámicas han llevado a un aumento en la demanda ciudadana de un \\"derecho a decidir\\", situando a Barcelona como epicentro de estos reclamos. - **Desafíos a la Escalabilidad del Estado-Nación:** La situación en Cataluña representa un desafío significativo a la escalabilidad y la soberanía del estado-nación español, planteando preguntas sobre la viabilidad de acomodar demandas de autogobierno y secesión dentro de una estructura estatal indisoluble. - **Política y Ciudadanía Metropolitana:** Barcelona, como ciudad global y metropolitana, emerge como un agente crucial en la articulación y movilización de la demanda secesionista, representando un caso destacado de cómo las escalas urbanas y metropolitanas están desempeñando roles prominentes en los movimientos secesionistas contemporáneos. - **Implicaciones Más Amplias para Europa:** El caso de Cataluña no es aislado, sino que ilustra retos más amplios a los que se enfrentan las naciones-estado en Europa, donde las reivindicaciones de autodeterminación, devolución y derechos democráticos están desafiando las nociones tradicionales de soberanía y ciudadanía. Conclusiones: El artículo concluye que, dados los profundos desafíos identitarios, políticos y escalares emergentes de Cataluña y su manifestación en Barcelona, el Estado-nación español encuentra considerables dificultades en acomodar la ciudadanía sin estado catalana bajo su estructura actual. Este análisis subraya la necesidad de repensar las relaciones entre nación, estado y ciudadanía en el contexto de las transformaciones urbanas, regionales y globales del siglo XXI."},{"prompt":"pero en que formas se ha de repensar ese encaje y mas aun cuando la constitucion es como es","completion":"El desafío de repensar el encaje de Cataluña dentro del Estado español, especialmente dado el marco constitucional actual que define la indisolubilidad de la nación española, requiere un enfoque multifacético y adaptativo que atienda tanto a las demandas políticas y culturales de Cataluña como a la integridad y funcionamiento del Estado. Aquí se exploran algunas formas en las que este reajuste podría conceptualizarse: # 1. **Reforma Constitucional:** Una vía para acomodar las demandas de Cataluña sería a través de una reforma de la Constitución Española que permitiera mayor flexibilidad en la autodeterminación de las comunidades autónomas, incluyendo la posibilidad de celebrar referendos sobre cuestiones de autonomía o independencia, bajo ciertos preceptos. Esto exigiría un consenso nacional y una reflexión profunda sobre la soberanía y la unidad del Estado, también considerando los precedentes que esto podría crear. # 2. **Modelo Federal o Confederal:** Adaptar un modelo más federal o confederal que permita a Cataluña (y potencialmente a otras regiones con fuertes identidades autonómicas) una mayor autogestión y autonomía fiscal podría ser una solución. Esto implicaría redefinir las competencias estatales y autonómicas, permitiendo a regiones como Cataluña tener más control sobre sus finanzas, educación, policía, y legislaciones en ciertas áreas. # 3. **Diálogo y Negociación Política:** Es fundamental establecer un diálogo continuo y constructivo entre el gobierno central y los representantes catalanes. A través de la negociación, se podrían alcanzar acuerdos específicos que atiendan a las demandas catalanas dentro del marco constitucional existente, evitando así la unilateralidad y buscando consenso y reconocimiento mutuo. # 4. **Derecho a Decidir:** Abordar y definir concretamente el \\"derecho a decidir\\" dentro del marco legal español, posiblemente como parte de una reforma constitucional o estatutaria, podría ofrecer a Cataluña un mecanismo legal y acordado para expresar sus aspiraciones de futuro, ya sea como parte de un modelo federalizado de España o incluso en términos de independencia, bajo determinadas circunstancias y con pleno respeto al ordenamiento jurídico. # 5. **Fortalecimiento de la Identidad Cultural y Lingüística:** Además del aspecto político y legal, es vital reconocer y fortalecer la identidad cultural, lingüística y histórica catalana dentro de España, promoviendo políticas que protejan y promuevan las peculiaridades culturales de Cataluña, garantizando su difusión y enseñanza. # 6. **Participación Ciudadana Activa:** Fomentar una mayor participación ciudadana en el proceso de toma de decisiones. Esto incluye no solo referendos, sino también foros de diálogo y mecanismos de participación que permitan a los ciudadanos expresar sus opiniones y preferencias sobre el futuro político y cultural de Cataluña. # Conclusión: Una solución duradera al desafío catalán requerirá creatividad, diálogo y la voluntad de explorar territorio constitucional y legal inédito. La clave será hallar un equilibrio que preserve la cohesión y la integridad de España, al tiempo que reconozca y acomode las legítimas aspiraciones catalanas. Esto probablemente requerirá compromisos de ambas partes, así como un enfoque inclusivo y participativo que movilice la voluntad tanto de la sociedad catalana como de la española en su conjunto."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

or more specifically the government of the Great Tang Empire is forcefully brought out of China by Han Chinese loyalists and supporters along with the Great Tang Empire\'s imperial family [the Imperial House of Li] with loyal elements of the Great Tang Empire\'s combined ground combat force and naval warfare force, the Great Tang Army, to the distant land of the supposedly Shinto pantheon

declaring a government in exile [of the Great Tang Empire] and [the Tang exiles after |the Tang exiles| conquering Yamato and establishing a Tang government in exile] utilize advanced technologies from Persia, Manchuria and Han China along with those brought over from the post-330 AD, pre-1453 Roman rump state of the absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy of the Eastern Roman Empire/\\"Byzantine Empire\\" ruling [the Byzantine Empire] over Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, the Balkans and the Caucuses in order to fund a primitive minature industrial revolution in their [the Tang

Chinese culture among their [the Tang exiles\'] subjects [the native ethnic Japanese people of the Japanese Home Islands and the native ethnic Koreans of the Korean peninsula along with the Japanese in Korea] which is somewhat successful. The Tang exiles also discover the the superconductive, extremely unstable and extremely explosive, radioactive, supermineral of Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise] among Yamato\'s geographical resources, [the Tang exiles] using it [the Sakuradite] to boost their [the Tang exile\'s] industrial, economic and military strength. Due to the rightful Chinese imperial government [the Great Tang Empire] being in exile [the Great Tang Empire] in Yamato, the Great Tang Empire\'s successor state of the pre-923 AD, post-937 successor state of the Later Tang ruling [the Later Tang] over much of Northern Han China is [the Later Tang in this scenario] simply an extension of the Tang government in exile in Yamato with ethnic Japanese and Korean soldiers from the conquered Yamato and Han Chinese, Hui, Mongolian and Manchurian soldiers of the Great Tang Army serving together against the Later Tang and the Great Tang Empire\'s enemies and the Great Tang Army utilizing Japanese and Korean war strategies against the warlords fighting in the China region. In defiance of the establishment of the post-960, pre-1279 Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Empire of the Great Song/Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" ruling [the Great Song State] over Han China, the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato decides to break off all ties with its [the Great Tang Empire\'s] home state [the China region] and [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declares itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] a separate state from the various dynasties ruling over the China region from Mongolia and Manchuria in its [the China region\'s] three thousand year history, [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] declaring itself [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] to [the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato] have the eternal mandate of heaven combined with the ruling members of the Imperial House of Li\'s status as both Emperors of the Great Tang State and Sultans and Caliphs of the Great Tang Empire as a Sunni Islamic Sultanate [Great Tang Empire] under Sharia Law by divine right and birthright. Thus the evolution of Yamato into the modern nation-state known today as Nihon/Nippon [Land of the Rising Sun |Nihon/Nippon|] still continues like in OTL, albiet for a different reason. The ruling members of the Imperial House of Li and the Imperial House of Great Yamato become intertwined by concubinage, multiple marriages and adoptions to the point where the two houses become one, with similar events happening between the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty and the native Japanese and Korean nobility, aristocracy and nobility. The Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty still speak, write and think in Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish, believing these languages [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] to be the civilized tongues [Mongolian, Manchu, Traditional Chinese, Persian and Turkish] of North Asia and Eurasia and viewing the Yue [Cantonese |Yue|] language spoken by Guangdong and Guangxi\'s native Cantonese people to be a barbarian tongue [Yue], and [Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty] promote the spread of these languages, especially Traditional Chinese, Mongolian and Manchu, among the people of Yamato, even though most of the ethnically Japanese and Korean native people of Yamato continue speaking and writing in Japanese and Korean The development of modern Japanese and Korean is heavily affected by these efforts by the Tang exile nobility, aristocracy and royalty however Japan\'s indigenous state religion, Shinto, becomes heavily influenced by the version of Sunni Islam practiced in the Tang Empire along with Han Chinese Daoist customs and Manchurian and Mongolian Shamanism. The development of Japanese Buddhism is also affected by the assimilation of the Tang exiles into Yamato as well. The Great Tang Empire\'s military flag, the San Chen, a red banner [the San Chen] with a large blue circle representing the Sun with [what the Blue Circle has] black rays in its [the San Chen\'s] center, with a smaller yellow circle representing the moon in the extreme left [of the black-rayed blue sun in the San Chen\'s center] is [the San Chen] combined with Yamato\'s and later Japan\'s shared naval jack and war banner of the Kyokujitsu-ki [Rising Sun Flag |Kyokujitsu-ki|] a white banner [the Kyokujitsu-ki] with [what the Kyokujitsu-ki has] a red disc representing the sun in its [the Kyokujitsu-ki\'s] center and sixteen red rays emanating from the disc [in the Kyokujitsu-ki\'s center], to form a new flag with the San Chen\'s black rayed sun with a yellow moon in the center of the Kyokujitsu-ki, although the yellow moon has [the yellow moon] [the yellow moon] the Imperial House of Great Yamato\'s/Minamoto dynasty\'s personal yellow chrysanthemum mom [Japanese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual, a family, or (more recently) an institution, municipality or business entity within Japan] in the center, with the yellow moon being darker to make the contrast between it and the chrysanthemum mom. The Great Tang Empire\'s unofficial naval jack, the Rì Qí [Sun Flag |Rì Qí|], a orange banner [the Rì Qí] with a red dot representing the Sun in the middle [of the Rì Qí], [the Rì Qí ]is [the Rì Qí] combined [the Rì Qí] with Yamato\'s and later Japan\'s civil banner, the Hinomaru [Ball of Sun |Hinomaru|], a white banner [the Hinomaru] with a red dot [representing the Sun] in the middle [of the Hinomaru] to form a new flag in the form of a orange banner with a white dot in the center [of the new flag] and a smaller red dot [in the center of the white dot]. This version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region eventually becomes seen as a separate state from China by the people of Asia and Eurasia, although it still tries to keep the Silk Road open and dominate Asian trade. The bakufu [tent government |bakufu|], [the bakufu] popularly [the bakufu] known as [the bakufu\'s more popular name] the shogunate, [the bakufu] a system of government in Japan dominated [the bakufu] by a feudal military dictatorship exercised in the name of a sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, the military rulers of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868 who |the sei-i taishōgun| carried out |the sei-i taishōgun| the actual duties of administration in Japan during that time period who |the sei-i taishōgun| also |the sei-i taishōgun| enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority within Japan], [the sei-i taishōgun] more popularly known as [the sei-i taishōgun\'s more famous name] a shogun or by the shogun himself, with the hierarchy that held the bakufu together being [the hierarchy holding the bakufu] reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the powerful Japanese magnates, and feudal lords who, from the 10th century to the early Meiji period in the middle 19th century ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings despite being subordinate to the shogun and nominally to the emperor, whom the buke/samurai served as well-paid retainers, the daimyō [large private land |daimyō], the collection of various powers that supported the shogunates and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke\'s other, more famous name] the samurai, and their subordinates is [the bakufu] still [the bakufu] established in 1192 in Japan however but the position of sei-i taishōgun is [the position of sei-i taishōgun in this timeline] combined with the position of Caliph inherited from the reigning members of the Imperial House of Li ruling over the Great Tang Empire in this timeline due to the influence of the Great Tang Empire on this version of Japan The integration of Tang industrial, military and trading efforts with what was taken from the Byzantines and Persia with indigenous Japanese skill and technology leads to the early development of firearms by the version of Japan formed by the the Great Tang Empire in exile in Yamato breaking away from the China region. Japan sends both soldiers and military aid to both the Byzantines and the Muslims fighting against the Western European crusaders, learning both Byzantine, Western European and Arab Muslim technology and military tactics which are brought back to Japan to develop it [Japan] further. During the sack of the Eastern Roman Empire\'s capital of Constantinople in 12–15 April 1204 by the Crusaders, which lead to the temporary disintegration of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire\'s ruling imperial family, the Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine, instead take direct control of the Crusader controlled Eastern Roman successor state of the Latin Empire, [the Hapsburgs] ruling the Latin Empire and the Holy Roman Empire as a dual monarchy. The Eastern Romans never recover their empire unlike in OTL and according to myths later passed down in Japan in this timeline, the last Eastern Roman Emperor in this timeline, Alexios V Doukas, gave the position of Roman Emperor to the Japanese Emperors and stated that Japan in this timeline was the true heir of Rome to a Japanese military delegation helping the Eastern Romans fighting the crusaders. The Japanese do help refugees and military units from Eastern Rome to escape to Japan from the crusaders with the help of the Arabs and the Tang\'s old friend, the Persians, further strengthening Japan\'s already immense military and economic power. The Japanese also get the Eastern Roman Empire\'s secret weapon of \\"Greek fire\\", a incendiary chemical weapon [Greek Fire] made from petroleum manufactured in and used by the Eastern Roman Empire from the seventh through the fourteenth centuries When the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation\'s] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, both [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] attempt [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] to [the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] invade Japan from 1274 and 1281, the invasion [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] still [of Japan by the Great Mongol Nation and the Great Yuan Empire] fail, but Japan is [Japan] able to [Japan] hold onto Korea unlike OTL. Development of rocketry technology by the Japanese continues during and after the Mongol-Japanese Wars, with indigenous Japanese gunpowder technology being combined with European smithing techniques and Sakuradite to create advanced weaponry. The Manchus in Han China still rise up in rebellion against the Mongolian occupation of Han China and [the Manchus in Han China] still [the Manchus in Han China] form the pre-Qing, post-1368, pre-1662 Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy/Islamic sultanate of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of post-Yuan China but the ethnic Korean military commander in Japanese controlled Korea, Yi Seong-gye, [Yi Seong-gye] is [Yi Seong-gye] killed in action while [Yi Seong-gye] fighting against Yuan forces retreating from the Manchurian Korean border and [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] thus [Yi Seong-gye in this timeline] never founds the pre-1932, post-1897, Han Chinese-Korean Royal House of Jeonji Yi/Yi dynasty/Lee dynasty/House of Yi-ruled imperial absolute royal monarchy and satellite state/tributary state of the Ming of the Great Joeson State/Great Joeson/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Great Joeson Kingdom/Joeson Kingdom in this timeline, and thus Korea remains under Japanese rule until the modern day and beyond. The Ming and Japan engage in a Cold War with each other for who [the Ming and Japan] will dominate North Asia and Eurasia, with the Ming challenging the Japanese-controlled Silk Road and dominating the China region and the Japanese dominating the waves. The Ming and Japanese also compete over who is the true heir of the Han Chinese civilization created by the Han dynasty and who should be the leader of Islam within North Asia. The indigenous Jurchen tribes of Manchuria still emerge from Manchuria and [the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria] still conquer the Ming in a brutal campaign from 1644-1662, [the Jurchens] subsequently establishing the post-1662, pre-1912 Manchu Imperial House of Aisin Gioro-ruled, Manchu-dominated imperial absolute dynastic federalist royal monarchy of the Great Qing Empire ruling [the Great Qing Empire] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia and Tuva from [the Great Qing Empire\'s stronghold] Inner and Outer Manchuria, but the Japanese are [the Japanese] the ones to [what the Japanese do in this timeline] conquer [what the Japanese conquer in this timeline] the post-1661, pre-1683 side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Kingdom of Tungning in [the territories the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over] Taiwan and the Pengu Islands on 10–16 July 1683 instead of the Great Qing Empire like in OTL. The Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Yamato and the Ming aristocracy, royalty and nobility on exile on Taiwan with the Zheng dynasty are also absorbed into the Japanese aristocracy, royalty and nobility after the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by the Japanese in this timeline. The Qing and Japanese also engage in a Cold War with each other [the Qing and the Japanese] with the Qing industrializing, developing and modernizing earlier than in OTL in response to the Japanese. Leaving Asia for a little bit, the American Revolution success as in OTL and not in canon Code Geass but the Holy Roman Empire takes direct control of the newly independent USA . British loyalists in the USA flee to Canada. Japan in this timeline is [Japan in this timeline] this timeline\'s version of the absolute parliamentary constitutional royal imperial monarchy of the German Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled British Empire in exile known as the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass franchise] ruling [the Holy Brittanian Empire] over the Southern United States, all of the Lesser Antilies, French Guyana, Suriname, Egypt, Sudan, Somalialand, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, Malyasia, Brunei, Singapore, Greater India [Pakistan, Bangladesh and India], Oman, Yemen, and Oceania [Australia and New Zealand] from [the Holy Brittanian Empire\'s homebase] Canada and Greater Jamaica [Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos, Belize and the Cayman Islands] which [the Holy Brittanian Empire] is [Brittania] still formed when the British lose the Napoleonic Wars to the French Empire like in canon Code Geass. The 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial royal monarchy but de facto feudal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate that [the Tokugawa shogunate] ruled [the Tokugawa shogunate] over the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa that [the Meiji Restoration] abolished the rule of the shoguns and the feudal system over Japan and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty as a result of the Meiji Restoration] regaining executive control over the Japanese government and the subsequent formation of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Empire of Japan/Imperial Japan ruling over Sahlakin and the Kurils, Okinawa, the Marinas, the Carolinas, Palau and the Korean peninsula from [the Great Japanese Empire\'s home base] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Meiji Restoration] leading to the development of a democratic parliamentary system in Japanese politics and [the Meiji Restoration] paving the way for the industrial and military development that made Japan into a regional and then a world superpower in OTL, [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] instead [the Meiji Restorationin this timeline ] leads [the Meiji Restoration in this timeline] to a compromise between the liberal, social democractic and progressive reformers who support the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] and the conservative, traditional aristocrats and merchants who support the de-facto Japanese royal family [the Tokugawa clan], with the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty still [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control over the Japanese government, but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan are [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] not [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] displaced [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] from their [the Tokugawa clan\'s reigning heads\'] role as shoguns [barbarian-killing generalissmos |shoguns|, the hereditary military dictators |shoguns| akin to the absolute monarchs of post-Rennissance Europe who |the shoguns| were the de-facto leaders of Japan during the period of feudal rule under the military dictatorship of the various shogunates of Japan from 1192-1868] but instead [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] becoming more akin to the Reichskanzlers [Realm Chancellors/Imperial Chancelors/Chancelors of the Realm |Reichskanzlers|] of the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire and the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire and the constitutional European royal monarchs of the post-Napoleon era. The buke/samurai are [the buke/samurai] not [the buke/samurai] abolished [the buke/samurai] along with the daimyō after the Meiji Restoration like in OTL, but [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] instead [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] being [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] into the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire, the Kazoku [\\"Magnificent/Exalted lineage\\" |Kazoku|] in this timeline. The Japanese still defeat the Great Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War of 25 July 1894 – 17 April 1895 but [the Japanese] have a stronger presence [the Japanese] in the Qing stronghold and homebase of Greater Manchuria unlike in OTL due to a more industrialized, developed and advanced combined armed forces of the Great Japanese Empire, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, more specifically the IJAF\'s ground combat arm, the Imperial Japanese Army than in OTL. The 10 October 1911 – 12 February 1912 Xinhai Revolution against the Great Qing Empire launched [the Xinhai Revolution] by [who launched the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Nationalist, Han supremacist and Han expansionist secret society/political organization/militant group of the Tongmenghui, what will later become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, center to far right, Chinese nationalist, Chinese supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist nationalist revolutionary party/secret society/paramilitary group of the Kuomintang [Chinese Nationalist Party |Kuomintang|] founded [the Kuomintang] by [the Kuomintang\'s founder] the Cantonese-Hakka medical student turned Han Chinese revolutionary, statesman and political theorist Sun Wen, [Wen] more popularly known as [Wen\'s more popular name] \\"Dr Sun Yat-Sen\\" in [when Wen founded the Kuomingtang] 1895 along with Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han monarchist and Han imperialist groups wishing to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming as the government of China, [the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] remains steadfast in its [the Xinhai Revolution\'s] goal of [what the aim of the Xinhai Revolution was] \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\", which [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] meant [\\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\"] that [the meaning of the slogan \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming\\" during the Xinhai Revolution] the pre-1644, pre-Great Qing Empire, Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled feudal imperial dynastic absolute dynasty royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\" would [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] be [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] restored [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] as the government [the Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/\\"Ming dynasty\\"] of Han China proper after the overthrow of the Great Qing Empire, with the stratocratic [military-ruled/military dominated |stratocratic|] Beiyang Government of the federal parliamentary presidental republic under military dictatorship of the first Republic of China ruling [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] over post Xinhai, post-Qing Han China never [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] a Republic [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] upon its [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] formation in [when the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China was |the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China| formed] on 10 March 1912 but [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] instead [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] always being [the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China] the Empire of China formed by the top dog in the Great Qing Empire\'s combined naval, aeiral and ground combat forces, the New Army turned rising star in the Beiyang-ruled ROC\'s political establishment after the Xinhai Revolution and eventually first president of the first Republic of China, the Han Chinese Yuan Shikai on [when Shikai transformed the Beiyang Government-ruled first Republic of China into the Empire of China] 12 December 1915 in OTL, with the Imperial House of Zhu being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] as the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu]. This [the Beiyang Goverment being formed as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] is [the Beiyang Government being |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] due to [why the Beiyang Government is |the Beiyang Government| formed |the Beiyang Government| as the Empire of China ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu and |the Beiyang Government| never |the Beiyang Government| being |the Beiyang Government| a Republic |the Beiyang Government|] the influence of the millenianist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] has [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] been [the Yellow Sand Society] gathering strength and influence among the Chinese people, the pervasive influence of the Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies and organized crime syndicates known as the Triads, which [the Triads] are pervasive through Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi] and [the Triads] also have the goal of [the Triads\' goal] restoring the the pre Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China despite their [the Triads\'] criminal activities and also to counter the influence of the charismatic leader of the Xinhai Revolution and subsequent founder of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist, semi-fascist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang after the toppling of the Great Qing Empire via the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent formation of the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the government of Han China, the Cantonese-Hakka doctor turned Han nationalist revolutionary and stateman Sun Wen, who [Sun Wen] is [Sun Wen] known as [Sun Wen\'s other name] \\"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen\\" outside Asia along with the desire of the Han Chinese people to emulate the Meiji Restoration, as well as Japan taking a more involved and direct role in [Japan] helping to [Japan] covertly support and [Japan] direct the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline. Due to Shikai never [what Shikai never does] proclaiming himself [Shikai] as Emperor of Han China like in OTL and the Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] restored [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] as the government [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] of Han China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China in this timeline, [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu being |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| restored |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| as the government |the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu| of Han China after the Xinhai Revolution in this timeline] as was the goal of the Xinhai Revolution [restoring the Ming to power in Han China after the overthrow of the Qing], the modern warlord era of post-Xinhai, post-Qing Han Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the vast majority of Han Chinese people supporting the restored monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] and the reenthroned Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] ready [the Imperial House of Zhu] to [the Imperial House of Zhu] listen to the Han Chinese people\'s needs. Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China\'s peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China\'s peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation\'s] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China\'s peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China]. The descendants of the last emperor of the Great Ming State, Zhu Youjian, who [Youjin] had the era name of [Youjin’s era name] Chongzhen, and the last emperor of the Ming rump state of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, whose [Youlang’s] era name was [Youlang’s era name] Yongli being [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] are [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] merged [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] into a single imperial line [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] via multiple marriages, concubinages and adoption, although the marriage of Shikai\'s daughter to the last Emperor of the Great Qing State, the then young Aisin-Gioro Henry, whose [Henry\'s] era name was [Henry\'s era name] Pu-Yi, [the marriage of Shikai\'s daughter to Henry] as one of his [Henry\'s] wives continues and goes on despite Shikai never [what Shikai never does] crowning himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China. Shikai\'s reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai\'s] legacy and [Shikai\'s reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces within Han China from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC unlike OTL due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen\'s chosen successor and heir of his [Wen\'s] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen\'s other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the Empire of China and what would become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen\'s three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, then [the embyroic Nationalist China] under the rule of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" [The National Protection War] ends with the victory of the Empire of China over the embryonic Nationalist China due to Shikai never making himself [Shikai] Emperor unlike in OTL and [Shikai] instead returning the Zhu to power in China in this timeline, the Empire of China agreeing for Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede [Yunnan] from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC and [Yunnan] subsequently restore the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan\'s] government in exchange for Yunnanese support against the Chinese nationalists, and Cantonian independence activists and supporters in the Nationalist strongholds of Guangxi and Guangdong undermining the Nationalist war effort. A miscommunication between Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and his [Wen\'s] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria, which [Manchuria] during and after the Xinhai Revolution came under the rule of [what ruled Manchuria during and after the Xinhai Revolution] the Han Chinese warlord clique/military junta/government faction of the Fengtian Clique, [Manchuria coming under the rule of the Fengtian Clique] which [the Fengtian Clique] was [the Fengtian Clique] headed [the Fengtian Clique] by [the ruler of the Fengtian Clique] the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system, Zhang Zhuolin, [Zhuolin] known [Zhuolin] as \\"the Old Marshal\\" [Japan taking Fengtian Clique-ruled post-Xinhai Manchuria] and [Japan taking] Inner Mongolia as protectorates [of Japan], [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in post-Xinhai, post-Qing, Fengtian Clique-ruled Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia. Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" is [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] killed [Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\"] during the fighting and the Nationalist Chinese state headquartered in Guangdong and Guangxi essentially becomes a independent Cantonian republic after his [Wen\'s/\\"Yat-Sen\\"\'s] death due to Cantonese independence activists and [Cantonese] nationalists desiring a separate state from Han China taking over Nationalist China after his [Wen\'s/\\"Yat-Sen\\"\'s] death. Japan still gains Sahlakin and the Kurils during the Russian Civil War of 1917-1920, [Japan] still [Japan] making these areas [Sahlakin and the Kurils] into the Japanese province of Karufuto. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and the Beiyang Government\'s Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek\'s] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia\'s Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan\'s Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of post-Xinhai Han China unlike OTL. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day. The Beiyang Government is [the Beiyang Government] still [the Beiyang Government] Japanophilic and [the Beiyang Government] friendly to the West despite it [the Beiyang Goverment] being [the Beiyang Goverment] a modern incarnation [the Beiyang Government] of the Great Ming State in this scenario, with Japan still having good relationships with and a fair amount of control over the Beiyang Government. The Shōwa Restoration of February 26, 1936 in the Japanese Empire, [the Shōwa Restoration] also known as the February 26 incident, [the Shōwa Restoration] being [the Shōwa Restoration] organized [the Shōwa Restoration] by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers belonging to the ultranationalist secret society with the goal of reorganizing the Japanese state along totalitarian militarist lines and state socialism, the Cherry Blossom Society [the Shōwa Restoration being carried out] with the goal of purging the Japanese government andJapanese military leadership of their [the young officers\' carrying out the Shōwa Restoration\'s] factional rivals and ideological opponents, [the Shōwa Restoration being |the Shōwa Restoration| carried out |the Shōwa Restoration|] with the goal of restoring power to the then newly enthroned Japanese Emperor Shōwa [personal name Hirohito] and simultaneously abolishing the liberal Taishō democracy, with the Taishō democracy within the Japanese Empire being [the Taishō democracy] replaced [the Taishō democracy] a small group of qualified people backing up a strong Emperor, [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] succeeds [the Shōwa Restoration in the Japanese Empire] due to NKVD agent Richard Sorge being [Sorge] by the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai and the Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō and [Sorge] quickly neutralized, with the spy ring he [Sorge] had built in Japan being [Sorge’s spy ring] mopped up without the Soviets being anywiser and the Japanese domestic and foreign intelligence organizations being reorganized in order to prevent further breaches of security, [the mopping up of the Soviet spy ring in the Japanese Empire] preventing them [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] from [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] noticing [the Tokkō and the Kempeitai] domestic threats within the Japanese Empire such as the Cherry Blossom Society. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War never happening, the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan all [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] survive [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] post-WW2 and post-1947 into the present day and beyond with Nationalist China surviving post-1949 into the present day and beyond. Brittania never conquers Japan unlike in canon Code Geass due to Japan in this timeline being [Japan in this timeline] stronger than in both real life and OTL and [Japan in this timeline] being [Japan in this timeline] the first nation [Japan in this timeline] to [Japan in this timeline] develop ICBMs and nuclear weaponry. The Brittanians still develop the Sakuradite [Code Geass franchise]-powered humanoid war machine mechs standing at an impressive height of four to five meters, equipped with Landspinners, ingenious self-propelled roller skates [Landspinners] affixed to their ankles, [the land spinners] enabling agile mobility and rapid speeds across diverse terrains, capturing data via the remarkable Factsphere Sensors encased within a protective layer of armor,[the Factsphere Sensors] can [the Factsphere Sensors] be [the Factsphere Sensors] retracted to heighten system sensitivity, ensuring the utmost precision and accuracy,[the Factsphere Sensors] endowed with thermographic capabilities and an array of other data-collection functions, all seamlessly collated in real-time, along with having the respective units\' respective cockpits in the respective units\' prominent \'hump back\', a self-contained control center [the cockpit] from which the mech is expertly piloted, [the cockpit] having the ability to be ejected in case of an emergency known as [the name of the mechs] Knightmare Frames, [Code Geass] in the 1950s but the Kempeitai manages to steal the designs and specs for the Knightmare Frames and soon all of East Asia has its own Knightmare Frames thanks to the Japanese. N.B: Everything in this timeline takes place in chronological order.","completion":"In an alternate timeline, the Great Tang Empire, led by the Mongolian and Manchurian-dominated Imperial House of Li, flees to the distant lands of Yamato following its forced collapse. This monumental migration, fueled by loyal Han Chinese supporters and the remnants of the Tang Army, leads to the establishment of a unique government in exile. Recognizing the potential of the land and its resources, the Tang exiles, leveraging advanced technologies from notable regions including Persia and the remnants of the Byzantine Empire, initiate a primitive industrial revolution in Yamato. This technological infusion, along with the discovery of the highly unstable and explosive mineral Sakuradite, bolsters the Tang exile\'s industrial, economic, and military prowess. Amidst this transformative era, the Tang exiles embark on a cultural mission to spread Sunni Islam along with Manchurian, Mongolian, and Han Chinese customs among the natives of Yamato and Korea. In this process, deep cultural syntheses occur, profoundly influencing language, religion, and societal norms within the region. The integration of the Imperial House of Li with the native Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty through a series of marriages, concubinages, and adoptions further cements the unique cultural fusion that characterizes this era. As the Tang exiles navigate their new geopolitical landscape, they establish a distinct flag symbolic of their merged identities, combining elements of the Tang military flag, the San Chen, with the traditional Yamato naval jack, the Kyokujitsu-ki, signifying the dawn of a new era. Despite the dissolution of the Great Tang Empire, its successor state, the Later Tang ruling over Northern Han China, continues to serve as an extension of the Tang government in exile, leveraging joint military strategies from its diverse coalition against common enemies. Determined to break free from the shadows of past Chinese dynasties, the Tang government in exile proclaims its independence, declaring a renewed mandate of heaven, uniquely positioning itself as both a continuation of the Tang dynasty and an Islamic Sultanate under Sharia Law. The socio-political landscape of Yamato evolves dramatically under this influence, seeing the rise of a robust, militarized society adept in advanced technologies including firearm development, significantly influenced by external interactions, particularly with the Byzantines and the Persians. Tensions with neighboring states, such as the Later Tang, the Song dynasty, and eventually, the Mongol Empire, shape the strategic orientation of the Tang exiles, leading to significant military engagements including the failed Mongol invasions of Japan. These conflicts underscore the strategic importance of the region, transforming it into a militarized state poised for regional dominance. The emergence of the Ming dynasty as a formidable contender further intensifies the power struggle within the region, leading to a protracted Cold War characterized by fierce competition over trade, military prowess, and cultural hegemony. Amidst this turbulent landscape, the Tang exiles\' legacy persists, influencing the political, cultural, and military development of the region profoundly, leading to the establishment of a state characterized by its unique synthesis of Tang and Yamato traditions, positioned as a distinct entity in the historical tapestry of East Asia."},{"prompt":"Note: This is in an alternate universe, This shop, despite being awesome, never existed, It does in this alternate universe, Also sorry for constantly showing you this, I’m just trying to make sure its perfect We’ve loved being in this spot as part of the wonderful Glasgow community Unfortunately, This shop is now closed, The realities of retail in the shopping landscape has made this decision unavoidable, We want to take the opportunity to thank you for shopping with us for so many years, You can find all about KikoRiki and its related online MMO RolyPolyLand at riki.com Goodbye forever… This sign was posted to the doors of Riki, a children’s shop in Glasgow on Wednesday The image ends with a poignant “Goodbye forever…” above a image of a crying Krash the Rabbit The store closed on Wedensday after 12 years trading at Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow The shop sold merchandise related to the animated series KikoRiki, The cartoon is a Russian cartoon about circular colorful animals and their fun adventures, The Riki shop opened in 1995 was originally Golden Adventures and was a general toy shop akin to Toys R Us but in 2003 became Riki and became focused on the then new surge in KikoRiki popularity in Scotland, However in June 2007, the store closed for the last time, Riki Group’s reasoning was the “realities of retail” was unavoidable, The shop was also closed so Riki could focus on business in it’s native Russia and develop more exciting new animated series or movies Hidden Glasgow - Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying. My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully. For the latest on this story and more, follow Glasgow Times Online” So the store was saved due to its significance, but what will happen now that it’s now shut down?, It’s been locked and abandoned since 23 June 2007, And it still looks as sad and lonely as it did after closure, I long to see it full of life once again, I really want it back. They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

The shelf spaces are bare, and the colorful decor appears faded without the laughter and chatter of children. Soft, melancholic music plays in the background.] Narrator (soft, nostalgic tone): “For years, Riki has been more than just a shop. It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious. The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here.

Blue blob, dark blue & cream blob, and that blue, yellow, white & pink blob now make perfect sense! 🎨 #DetailMatters #NostalgiaTrip #LogoMysterySolved” Write a Tvforum convo where this is the only time STV has willingly advertised an ITV product (and GMTV, counting Toonattik), Thread Title: The Riki Store Goodbye Ad: A Unique Moment in STV Advertising — User1: ScotTVFan Did anyone else realize that the Riki Store goodbye advert might be the only instance where STV has openly and willingly advertised an ITV product, including GMTV if we’re counting Toonattik? It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. — Write a convo where a user remembers for a few weeks in late June-Early July 2007 there was a generic page with a black background and a animated Flash SWF of Krash crying, with sound effects and music, Below this there were 4 logos (the 3 are the usual ones seen in Riki goodbye messages, the 4th is RolyPolyLand) This was on rikistore.co.uk, It eventually redirected to rolypolyland.com by early August","completion":"Thread Title: Remembering the Riki Store Closure Online Tribute --- User1: RetroWebWanderer Hey everyone, does anyone else remember the incredibly touching online tribute the Riki Store set up on their website right after closing in June 2007? For a few weeks during late June to early July 2007, if you visited rikistore.co.uk, you were greeted with this stark black background page featuring an animated Flash SWF of Krash crying. It was surprisingly detailed, with sound effects and the sorrowful music that played in the store\'s final minutes. Beneath this poignant animation, there were four logos displayed. Three of these are familiar to us from the Riki goodbye messages – STV, CITV, Toonattik – but the fourth was for RolyPolyLand. It really felt like they were guiding us on where to go next, both on TV and online, to keep the memory and the magic of Riki alive. --- User2: NostalgiaNavigator Absolutely remember that! It felt like such a modern way to say goodbye at the time, leveraging the web to connect with their audience one last time. I think it also pointed towards how online spaces were becoming the new frontier for engaging with audiences, especially kids. The choice to include RolyPolyLand was particularly savvy, signaling their next big venture in a subtle way. --- User3: FlashEraFanatic That Flash animation of Krash really hit me hard. It was like watching the end of an era right before our eyes, in real-time. Flash animations had this unique charm, and to use it for such a heartfelt farewell was both brilliant and bittersweet. Plus, the sound design on the page was top-notch; it was more than just a visual goodbye - it was a deeply emotional experience. --- User4: DigitalArchivist For anyone who missed it or wants to revisit that moment, you might find archived versions of the page on the Wayback Machine. It\'s fascinating to see how even in their closing moments, Riki was pushing the envelope on how retail spaces communicated with their audiences online. Transitioning the page to redirect to RolyPolyLand by early August was a smart move, directly funneling that lingering interest and emotional investment into their new project. --- User5: LogoLover The inclusion of the four logos was a stroke of genius. It not only served as a signpost for where fans could continue to follow their favorite characters but also as a testament to the partnerships and networks Riki was part of. The transition from a physical store into the digital realm, symbolized by that page redirecting to RolyPolyLand, marked a significant shift in how children\'s entertainment was evolving. --- User6: GlasgowGamerKid I remember visiting that page after hearing the store had closed. It was a surreal experience seeing Krash cry like that; I wasn\'t ready for the feels trip. Kudos to whoever designed that page; it managed to encapsulate all the love and sadness of the moment perfectly. And then leading us to RolyPolyLand was like a gentle nudge saying, \\"It\'s not over; the adventure continues here.\\" Really showed how ahead of their time Riki was in understanding the digital landscape. ---"},{"prompt":"Write a follow up asking if it was did by Proud Creative like the closure notice, or by the shows usual animators, a former worker answers this","completion":"--- User7: ProudRikiAlumni Hey @RetroWebWanderer and everyone in this thread, it\'s heartwarming to see the Riki Store remembered with such fondness. To answer the question about who created the touching Flash SWF of Krash crying on the goodbye page, it was a collaboration. The initial design and the idea for the Flash animation came from Proud Creative, the same team responsible for the closure notice. They understood our brand deeply and were instrumental in helping us convey the right tone and emotion during our closing period. However, to ensure the animation stayed true to the character\'s original essence, we reached out to the show\'s usual animators to bring Krash to life in this context. It was crucial for us that the goodbye felt authentic to what our fans had grown to love about the series and the store. This teamwork between Proud Creative and the show\'s animators allowed us to create something truly special for our goodbye page. It was a somber task, but everyone involved put a lot of heart into it, knowing how much it would mean to both our team and the fans. The sound effects and music, which complemented the animation\'s emotional impact, were carefully selected to resonate with those who had shared in the joy and wonder of Riki. I\'m genuinely touched to see it remembered and discussed here. It was a challenging time for all of us at the store, but knowing that we managed to leave a lasting, positive impression on our community brings me a lot of solace. And yes, steering our audience towards RolyPolyLand was our way of saying the adventure wasn\'t over. We wanted to leave a path forward, a token of continuity amidst the goodbye.

For those who might not have been able to see it or remember it clearly, along with the memorable Flash animation, there were several crucial links provided on the page that pointed fans toward where they could continue to follow their favorite stories and find updates.

The intention behind each link clearly shows the effort to keep the community engaged and informed, ensuring the legacy of Riki would live on through other mediums. I suppose in many ways, these links were more than just URLs; they were lifelines thrown out to a community not ready to say goodbye.

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","completion":"知道了"},{"prompt":"当前时间:2024/4/20 09:09:08

implement Steps 3A and 3B for the fireworks shader, you will need to calculate the trajectory of a particle using the physics of ballistic motion and then render that particle as it moves. Below are the filled-in implementations for these steps. # Step 3A: Simulate the motion of a single particle In Step 3A, you need to calculate the current position of a particle under the influence of gravity (i.e., ballistic motion). The formula for the position under uniform acceleration is given by: [ textbf{p} = textbf{p}_0 + textbf{v}_0t + frac{1}{2}textbf{g}t^2 ] Where: - (textbf{p}_0) is the initial position, - (textbf{v}_0) is the initial velocity, - (t) is the time, - (textbf{g}) is the acceleration due to gravity. ```glsl vec2 moveParticle(vec2 initPos, vec2 initVel, float t) { vec2 currentPos = initPos; /* your implementation starts */ currentPos = initPos + initVel * t + 0.5 * g * t * t; /* your implementation ends */ return currentPos; } ``` # Step 3B: Putting simulation and rendering together In Step 3B, you simulate and render the motion of a single particle. You first update the particle\'s position using `moveParticle` based on ballistic trajectory calculations, then you render this updated position using `renderParticle`. ```glsl vec3 simSingleParticle(vec2 fragPos, vec2 initPos, vec2 initVel, float t, float brightness, vec3 color) { vec3 fragColor = vec3(0.0); /* your implementation starts */ vec2 currentPos = moveParticle(initPos, initVel, t); fragColor = renderParticle(fragPos, currentPos, brightness, color); /* your implementation ends */ return fragColor; } ``` These updated sections complete Steps 3A and 3B, implementing the simulation of a single particle\'s ballistic motion and rendering it as part of the overall shader program. With these implementations, you\'re simulating and visualizing the trajectory of a particle affected by gravity, providing a foundational effect for creating more complex animations like fireworks."},{"prompt":"#version 330 core uniform vec2 iResolution;

following question THAT IS AN ESSAY QUESTION AND ALL FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES: “Task 1: Ransomware is a computer malware, which prevents or limits users from accessing their system by encrypting victim’s files with a strong encryption key making them inaccessible unless a ransom is paid. This malicious software often installs covertly on a victim’s computer, runs a cryptology attack that adversely affects it, and then requires payment from the victim to get a decryption key. Today, there are dozens of ransomware strains. Globally, ransomware continues to be a problem with new families emerging regularly. There are two types of ransomware in circulation. The common type today is crypto ransomware, which aims to encrypt files. The other is locker ransomware, which is designed to lock the computer, preventing victims from using it. In this assessment, we will only consider the crypto ransomware type. Your task is to design a new crypto ransomware based on the Feistel structure, which utilises a product cipher algorithm that combines three of the classical transposition and substitution ciphers.

Within the realm of malware proliferation, three predominant channels stand preeminent: phishing [a mode of cyberattack that deceives individuals into divulging personal information by mimicking trusted entities via digital communications (Hadnagy & Fincher, 2015)] campaigns, exploit kits, and malvertising [injection of malicious advertisements into legitimate networks, coercing users into downloading ransomware (Kharraz, et al., 2015)] which when coupled with phishing remains as one of the most pervasive vectors for ransomware distribution (Liska & Gallo, 2016). With regards to the ransomware in question, harnessing a synergistic integration of these channels possess the potentiality of markedly enhancing both penetration and efficacy. Leveraging sophisticated social engineering stratagems amidst phishing initiatives is quintessential to the architecture of this distribution methodology (Hadnagy & Fincher, 2015). Through the strategic alteration of content hashing, emails ingeniously tailored with precision can surpass spam filtration mechanisms, thus demonstrating the propensity to manipulate recipients into inadvertently installing malware under the guise of attachments that echo ‘authenticity’ (Bertino & Islam, 2017). In conjunction with email marketing mediums such as Mailchimp and MailerLite to name a few, by means of compromised accounts, these services can be seamlessly harnessed to automate and augment the campaign. Concomitantly, exploit kits constitute an equally insidious disbursement vector. These apparatuses, orchestrated to identify and capitalise on frailties present in a victim’s browser or outdated plugins, guarantee the automated propulsion of the ransomware upon engagement with a compromised digital domain (Kotov & Massacci, 2013); exploit kits with Angler and Neutrino being exemplars, are amenable to utilisation, in view of their past adaptations by cybercriminal contingents for equivalent intents (O\'Kane, et al., 2018). In the quest for optimising this technique, the adoption of Traffic Distribution Systems [TDS] may considerably expedite the delivery of the exploit kit to those signified by outmoded software repertoire. Obfuscation: The art of concealing the operational and pernicious junctures of crypto ransomware mandates an elaborate obfuscation strategy that affirms robustness in circumventing detection and subsequent scrutiny. Paramount to this strategy is the implementation of advanced obfuscation techniques, which not only just conceal the manifestation of ransomware, however also convolute its attack pattern, making decomposition and mitigation by cybersecurity defences a daunting challenge (You & Yim, 2010). Enacting obfuscation entails a nuanced approach, amalgamating both static [analysing code without requiring the programme to be executed] and dynamic [utilises real-time data for programme evaluation] methodologies to thwart analysis apparatuses and bypass dynamic analysis mechanisms, respectively (You & Yim, 2010). Static Obfuscation: Static obfuscation is proficiently attainable through the application of approaches including code encryption, coupled with the incorporation of remarkably evasive polymorphic malware [adaptively and continually alters its code via encryption (Li, et al., 2011)] and metamorphic malware [completely rewrites its code per cycle without any encryption (Li, et al., 2011)]. These approaches ingeniously modify the ransomware’s signature in successive iterations, all the while without compromising its intrinsic functionality, thereby outmanoeuvring signature-based detection protocols (Szor, 2005). Supplementary code fortification tools like VMProtect and Themida sophisticate code analysis through providing advanced virtualisation and encryption, profoundly hindering reverse engineering and decompilation (Eagle, 2008). Dynamic Obfuscation: The deployment of techniques in dynamic obfuscation, particularly runtime packers in conjunction with the insertion of junk code, considerably amplifies the surreptitious nature of ransomware. The application of these measures dynamically reshapes the code throughout the entirety of its execution, preventing runtime analysis whilst nullifying detection; supplemented with anti-debugging methods that exhibit the latency to counteract forensic and debugging technologies instantaneously- this bolsters this strategy, assuring the malware’s undertakings remain hidden (Udupa, 2005; Mickens, 2011). Command and Control (C&C) Communications: The quintessence of crypto ransomware’s operational versatility is encapsulated within its C&C framework, functioning as the hidden fulcrum for exchanging encrypted directives and key management between the compromised entity and the adversary’s server. This covert conduit, through the use of asymmetric encryption [a type of encryption that uses a pair of keys, public- that partakes in local encryption activities, and private- which is securely transmitted to the C&C server via encrypted channels] (Stallings, 2017)], fortifies the conveyance of the encryption key, indispensable for the cryptography of files, thereby upholding discretion against prospective interception (Paar & Pelzl, 2010; Stallings, 2017; Liska & Gallo, 2016). As cited by (Paar & Pelzl, 2010), this course sets in motion the ransomware generating a distinctive encryption key tailored to the victim’s files, guaranteeing the key’s resilience is impervious to brute-force attacks; a resultant chain of events that inexorably forces victims to disburse a ransom for the restitution of their data follows. To facilitate undetectable communications, this ransomware utilises a technique known as beaconing, whereby it transmits encrypted signals at regular intervals to connect with its C&C server. This method incorporates a Domain Generation Algorithm [/DGA- automatically generates a plethora of domain names that malware can use to establish connections with, command, and control servers], heightening the complexity of either blocking or tracing the server (Atonakakis, et al., 2011; Al-Rimy, et al., 2018). Communications evolve from simple HTTPs to intricate encrypted channels such as Tor/ I2P for key transmission, proficiently obscuring it from network traffic analysis (Huang, et al., 2018). To guarantee resilience confronting disruption, multiple fallback mechanisms are embedded within the ransomware’s architecture, streamlining an incessant reestablishment of severed connections. Furthermore, the C&C infrastructure leverages a decentralised model, diversifying its command vertices whilst significantly obstructing termination efforts by judicial bodies (Mickens, 2011). Each of these carefully crafted strategies are purported to elevate the durability and discreetness of this ransomware campaign, ensuring continuity and elusiveness in its operations. File Selection for Encryption: Leveraging the Feistel cipher framework, this ransomware purports to adopt a multifaceted strategy for the selection & encryption of files, incorporating an extensive assortment of file types essential for individual, and corporate usage (Stallings, 2011). This system proactively scouts for and encrypts files- extending from documents and images to emails and databases- contingent on their corresponding extensions, comprising .docx, .ost, .pdf, .pst, .png, .pst, and .sql, amongst others; thus, securing a comprehensive sweep of both ubiquitous and strategically critical data. Applying a recursive traversal algorithm, it assiduously searches local and networked repositories, effortlessly navigating multitudinous file systems and storage technologies, hence an exhaustive search in ensured by employing superior access rights obtained through exploitation techniques delineated previously (Casey, 2011; Carrier, 2005)- warranting vast ramifications, coercing victims toward ransom demand fulfilment. Analysing Ransomware Security: The advancing convolution of cryptographic ransomware, notably those founded on Feistel cipher architectures, demands thorough security scrutiny to mitigate prevalent cryptographic incursions (Anderson, 2008; Stinson, 2005). This prototype integrates the principles of transportation and substitution amid a Feistel construct, establishing a labyrinthine encryption approach- this resultantly presents considerable obstacles for adversaries seeking to decrypt files, and/ or locate and eradicate the ransomware sans financial indemnity (Bertino & Sandhu, 2005; Ferguson, et al., 2010). Mitigating Meet-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: This cryptographic model employs successive encryption cycles, interweaving transposition and substitution procedures- such recursive profundity in encryption elevates the computational sophistication requisite for decrypting the cipher devoid of comprehension of the key, accordingly, subverting the efficacy of MitM attacks (Diffie & Hellman, 1976). Therefore, the introduction of non-linear constituents into encryption cycles considerably elevates the integrity of the encrypted data, markedly fortifying resistance to differential cryptanalysis by intensifying the complications in forging plaintext and ciphertext pair relational pairings (Biham & Shamir, 1991). Sequentially, the complexity of each cycle’s output heightens, diminishing the chance of discerning intermediate plaintext states imperative in foiling MitM attacks. Bypassing the Pitfalls of Frequency Analysis: Frequency analysis, an acclaimed instrument in cryptanalysis [the study of decrypting cryptographic systems (Stinson, 2005)] in the face of basic substitution ciphers, encounters a pronounced decline in effectiveness against the multifaceted encryption system of this ransomware in question. The employment of elaborate substitution algorithms, whose variations are iteratively administered throughout encryption sequences, substantially confounds frequency analysis activities. Concurrently, the sporadic variation of key schedules efficiently neutralises the dangers presented by conventional frequency-dependent cryptanalysis practices (Matsui, 1993). Characteristically, the Feistel structure systematically transmutes character frequency distributions across its encryption cycles, masterfully obsoleting frequency analysis for cipher deconstruction (Sinkov & Feil, 2009). Moreover, the presence of polyalphabetic components unremittingly modulates the substitution protocol, consequently corroding frequency analysis initiatives (Singh, 1999). Countermeasures for Brute Force Attacks: Feistel-centric architectures, with their dependency on extensive keys of variable length, inherently possess vigorous defensive measures to combat brute force attacks (Stinson, 2005). The calculated execution of key expansion strategies, by which short keys are methodologically elongated to more intricate, lengthier variants, calls for an exponentially greater computational exertion for brute force deciphering, accordingly, ingeniously enlisting time an ally against any unsanctioned decryption efforts (Hellman, 1980). This defence is fortified by an immense key space, via synthesising multiple conventional ciphers, rendering the notion of a meticulous key search ineffective within any feasible timeframe, consequently affording preservation against brute force attacks. Moreover, the implementation of a versatile key generation model, distinctively allocating keys for individual scenarios, adds a layer of convolutedness- subsequently thwarting brute force attack attempts (Schneier, 1996; Katz & Lindell, 2014). Counteractive Measures for Decryption and Detection: Decryption endeavours, absent the direct procurement of the corresponding decryption key is profoundly taxing due to the aforementioned cryptographic hindrances. Refined obfuscation manoeuvres, conjoined with the core complexities of encryption, not only obfuscate the decryption endeavours, but also mask the ransomware from signature-oriented detection algorithms, thereby fostering a stratified and multi-layered defence schema (You & Yim, 2010). Nevertheless, one cannot afford to ignore conceivable theoretical susceptibilities regarding cryptanalysis; the domain of cryptographic attacks is in perpetual flux, demanding sustained observances and optimisations to the encryption framework applied by the ransomware. In the realm of identifying ransomware, elaborate obfuscation alongside C&C communicative strategies elucidated herein serve to impede conventional heuristic and signature-based technologies (Ucci, et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the utilisation of sophisticated behavioural analysis instrumentation, monitoring system operations for deviations indicative of ransomware, yield a tangible method for discernment and deterrence without acceding to monetary demands. The engagement of decentralised machine learning-oriented models demonstrates the potential to distinguish the nuanced behavioural modalities of ransomware operations, promoting an anticipatory security stance (Apruzzese, et al., 2018). Preventative Actions Against Reverse Engineering: Warding off reverse engineering pursuits- imperative for the exposure and comprehension of the inner machinations of the ransomware- as formerly noted calls for the strategic usage of obfuscation techniques. Harnessing the prowess of refined software protection tools [take Enigma Protector and Code Virtualizer as exemplars], they metamorphose plain code into a confounding conundrum, vastly inhibiting the reverse engineering process, at the same time as consolidating the safeguarding measures, resultantly heightening the insurmountable hurdle for adversaries in pursuit of counteracting the ransomware devoid of unobstructed accessibility of the decryption key (Votipka, et al., 2018). This strategy adeptly shrouds logical patterns in secrecy whilst drastically augmenting the difficulty quotient and minimising the success threshold for cyber defence bodies endeavouring to crack and/ or invalidate the ransomware without complying to ransom payment (Megira, et al., 2018; Zander, et al., 2007). With the objective of bolstering resistance in opposition to reverse engineering, the synergistic melding of dynamic code analysis with runtime packers and polymorphism, all collectively infuse an additional stratum of complexity- a modification of which renders static analysis endeavours ineffective. Integrating anti-debugging measures is of paramount criticality in complicating the reverse engineering trajectory, hence fortifying defences against direct decryption or disassembly attempts without the designated key (Eagle, 2014). Payment Process Overview: The ransomware’s remittance mechanism is meticulously engineered, exemplifying stringent cryptographic diligence, and exploitation of users’ psychological susceptibilities. Victims are directed to an anonymised payment gateway intended to intuitively navigate the victim, predominantly leveraging cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, this primarily is for the undetectability, and fortified and private transactional attributes they advocate that aim to secure optimised security (Meiklejohn, et al., 2013). Comprehensible and linear instructions, comprehensively explicated via a Tor-encrypted webpage, steer victims along the transaction process, accentuating ease, and haste for rapid conformance- affirming a seamless experience. Allocating a unique wallet address to each victim diminishes risk while promoting transactional confidentiality; subsequent to payment, an automated verification system commences decryption key disbursement, capitalising on the blockchain’s inherent security for credence (Conti, et al., 2018; Franco, 2014).\\".","completion":"In response to the escalating menace of ransomware attacks, it is paramount for organizations to devise and implement potent mitigation strategies. This section delineates both technical controls and compliance-related practices to thwart such malicious endeavors. **Technical Controls:** 1. **Endpoint Defense-in-Depth:** A stratified approach to endpoint security is imperative. Employing advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, which leverage behavioral analysis and machine learning, can preemptively detect and isolate ransomware activities (Al-rimy et al., 2018). Coupled with regular patch management protocols to address vulnerabilities and the deployment of application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized applications from executing, organizations can significantly reduce their ransomware susceptibility. 2. **Robust Data Backup and Recovery Plan:** The efficacy of ransomware heavily relies on its ability to leverage data as hostage. Implementing a comprehensive data backup and recovery plan, including regular backups, off-site storage solutions, and periodic restoration tests, ensures organizational resilience against data loss.

Has Pashukanis really overlooked the sphere of production, the holy grail of Marxism? What are the consequences for law that circulation is mediated by production, or rather that the whole determines the parts? And why in fact does not only surplus-value, but also law, have to systemically arise from the sphere of production? Andreas Harms objects that the element of mediation that goes beyond equivalent exchange remains alien to law480 ‘Surplus-value may well arise from the sphere of production, Pashukanis does not argue against that either. Law, however, only does its concept justice through circulation, precisely because it leaves out production’.181 It must be recognised that the legal form remains limited to exchange, forming a factual abstraction from the social relation of capital.182 He believes that Pashukanis was perfectly aware of the totality of capitalist society and that he equally consciously related law precisely to exchange, because it shares the real abstraction of the exchange process. But what is the consequence of real abstraction? According to Josef Esser, it is specific to the character of capitalist commodity production that the fetish of the legal subject mystifies the underlying class relation, and that the antagonism of the production sphere, along with factual inequality and unfreedom, can no longer be recognised in law.183 In the introduction to the English edition of Pashukanis’ main work, Chris Arthur strengthens this understanding: the objection concerning the sphere of circulation is misleading, for it is precisely one of the interesting features of bourgeois exploitation that it inheres in economic relations that do not achieve formal legal expression. Formally speaking, Pashukanis is correct to refer law only to social relationships based on commodity exchange ... The monopolisation of the means of production by the capitalist class is an extra-legal fact ...184 Bernhard Blanke also argues that the categories of freedom and equality, which are owed to the simple circulation of commodities, belong constitutively to the concept of capital: ‘They already contain the contradiction between the formal equality of commodity owners and their content of inequality in the production context\'?85 The extensive and long-lasting controversy about Pashukanis’ supposed derivation from the sphere of circulation is a classic sign of a dogmatic narrowing of the overall issue, which is exemplary for the impasse Marxist legal theory had reached. For instead of asking the question of how law is connected to myriad social relations (and not only economic ones), a conflict about the relationship of production and circulation rages. This is particularly unfruitful, because circulation and production are only partial aspects of the social reproduction process; this ‘includes both the circulation process proper and the actual production process. These form the two great sections of its movement, which appears as the totality of these two processes’.186 Marxist theory’s fixation on production over the last century has led to the most peculiar blunders, and not least that of excluding generative reproductive labour, which in patriarchal societies is predominantly carried out by women.187 The main problem emerging in this discussion lies in the difficulty of grasping antagonistic capitalist society in its totality and thus of conceiving a partial moment such as law so that it contains the determinations of that totality as such, and not only of one moment. It is doubtful that this issue has been satisfactorily resolved in what has been represented thus far. The relationship of circulation and production may have been put into the appropriate perspective. But has the analysis of the legalform really been exhausted, as Karl Korsch demanded?188 A first indication to the contrary is the basic fact that neither Pashukanis nor his successors bothered to develop what was meant by such a form-analysis before going on to describe law’s ‘function’ for or its ‘reflex’ out of the commodity form. Pashukanis’ method itself remains rather more schematic, as he merely juxtaposes the commodity form with the legal form.189 As the following critiques will show, this lack of a form analysis leads to further confusion and reductionism. 2.5.2 Civil Law as Primary Law Closely connected to the ‘circulation-allegation’ is the critique that was already raised by Hans Kelsen: that ‘all law is private law’ for Pashukanis, and that ‘public law is a mere ideology of bourgeois jurists’.^0 This is no less true for criminal law, whose differentia specifica is not at all developed. Pashukanis has not actually overlooked this possible objection. To the contrary, he took care to note that private law is the ‘ratio scripta of every commodity-producing society’.191 He assumed that it represents at the core ‘law as such’, of which the other areas of law are only variations, for in the commodity-producing society the most diverse relations ‘approximate the prototype commercial relation’.^2 In particular the principle of equivalence becomes generalised, as he aims to show in the case of criminal law. But in this he was not really convincing. Thus Norbert Reich wrote in 1972 that ‘if one wants to truly understand Pashukanis’ work in legal theory, one must not forget that Pashukanis did not really present a general legal theory here, but a theory of civil law’.193 This is due to Pashukanis’ understanding of the relation of commodity owners to each other as the fundamental one - the relation that generates, and is the source of, law. The theory of civil law is thus brought about by the reduction of the legal concept to the commodity form?94 Antonio Negri criticised around the same time the ‘privat- istic mythology’ in Pashukanis’ work. This is the most disappointing aspect of his concept (‘This may well be the case!’). The claim that the idea of subjection to an external norm-setting authority has nothing to do with the legal form, misrecognises that ‘in its highest stage, capitalist development’ brings forth just such a kind of public law - a public law that affords to bourgeois law only a dialectical autonomy.^5 His ‘polemic against state controlled normativity’ overreaches, as it lets the antagonistic rifts of bourgeois society disappear under the organising element of private law: ‘The private is thus exalted in a radicalism of the founding functions of the juridical order that is purely illus- ory’,196 Here the connection of the two points of criticism becomes clear. The state form is for Negri the expression of the fundamental social antagonism. A society based on exploitation cannot only reproduce itself based on the laws of the market and can therefore not be reduced to private law either. In this respect ignoring state law (in the sense of public and criminal law) is illusory. What leads to this surplus of civil law in Pashukanis? What shines through here is first of all the Marxist notion that civil law is closer to production than public law, because ‘in it the relations and reciprocal demands of materially producing subjects are recorded\'.1’’7 In addition one must not forget the historical context here. For a similar, although not Marxist, idea was articulated in 1913 by Eugen Ehrlich, who is considered a founder of the sociology of law, when he responded to Kelsen and legal positivism that legal norms established by the state are insignificant in comparison to ‘living law’, the legal relations of people and the law of jurisprudence.^8 Furthermore, in the methodology of civil law the theory of free law was gaining ground for its doctrine of judicial interpretation, which aimed to liberate judges from the fixed letter of the law. This was grounded in the understanding that statutory law as such remained incomplete. In addition, Pashukanis continued to oppose the rationalist illusion of theories shaped by the Enlightenment: that capitalist societies could actually selfregulate autonomously through the conscious establishment of norms. Ultimately, however, it must be noted that in overestimating the opposite position he fell victim to a widespread cliché, namely that it is possible to separate the public and private sphere, the state and the market, beyond the level of analysis; in this respect one has to agree with Negri. Only in this creation of absolutes, which has to assume a self-regulation of the market, can one area of law have precedent over another. In this historical partition of private and public law into separate legal matters which previously coexisted side by side - as occurred in Prussian Common Law, for example - lies the risk of ignoring their shared context. Thus neoliberal theories already pronounce the ‘society of private law’.199 In this context Klaus Günther pointed out that there are certainly good reasons to read modern theories of natural law and rationality as though ‘private law was there “first”, that is, functionally and temporally before public law as the law of bourgeois society’. Those interpretations, however, stay silent on the fact that private autonomy was, for instance in Kant or Locke, always connected to the force of coercive power.200 This abstraction from the totality of society thus leads not only here, but also in Pashukanis, to a ‘privat- istic mythology’. Furthermore, ignoring public law shows its weaknesses especially in the era of the welfare state. For it is its establishment in particular that has led to an enormous public juridification of seemingly private spheres - one that Pashukanis could not imagine for historical reasons. The critique, however, clarifies one thing above all: similarly to the problem of the sphere of circulation (significantly, private law is the ideal type of law for the circulation sphere) the lack of a form analysis also shows its negative consequence here. This is also apparent in the next point of critique.”翻译为中文","completion":"“但这些模糊概念的含义是什么？帕舒卡尼斯真的忽视了生产领域，马克思主义的圣杯吗？法律受到生产介导的流通影响，或者说整体决定部分，这对法律有什么后果？为什么不仅剩余价值，而且法律也必须从生产领域系统地产生？ 安德烈亚斯·哈姆斯反对认为，超出等价交换的中介元素对法律来说是陌生的。‘剩余价值可能源自生产领域，帕舒卡尼斯也不否认。然而，法律只有通过流通才对其概念做出公正的论述，这正是因为它排除了生产’。必须认识到，法律形式仅限于交换，形成了对资本社会关系的实际抽象。他认为，帕舒卡尼斯非常清楚资本主义社会的整体，并且同样有意识地将法律准确地关联到交换，因为它分享了交换过程的实际抽象。但实际抽象的后果是什么？据约瑟夫·埃瑟表示，资本主义商品生产的特点是法律主体的幻想神秘化了底层的阶级关系，并且生产领域的对立，以及事实上的不平等和不自由，在法律中不再被认识。在帕舒卡尼斯主要作品的英文版引言中，克里斯·阿瑟加强了这一理解：关于流通领域的反对意见是误导的，因为资产阶级剥削的一个有趣特征正是它存在于不获法律形式表达的经济关系中。从形式上讲，帕舒卡尼斯正确地将法律仅指向基于商品交换的社会关系...资本家阶级对生产手段的垄断是一个超法律的事实... 伯恩哈德·布兰克还争论说，商品简单流通所欠的自由和平等的范畴，构成了资本概念的本质：‘它们已经包含了商品所有者形式平等与生产背景下内容不平等之间的矛盾’？ 关于帕舒卡尼斯所谓的衍生自流通领域的长期而广泛的争议是马克思主义法律理论陷入僵局的典型标志，这对整体问题的教条化缩小是典型的。因为不是问法律如何与众多社会关系（不仅仅是经济关系）相连，而是关于生产与流通关系的冲突激烈进行。这是特别无益的，因为流通和生产只是社会再生产过程的部分方面；‘这包括了流通过程本身以及实际生产过程。这些形成了其运动的两个主要部分，表现为这两个过程的总和’。过去一个世纪里马克思主义理论对生产的固定观念导致了最奇特的错误，尤其是排除了在父权社会中主要由女性承担的生殖劳动。 在这场讨论中出现的主要问题在于把握资本主义社会的对立性整体及其困难，因此设想法律这样的部分时刻以便其包含那种整体性的决定，而不仅仅是某一时刻。值得怀疑的是，到目前为止这个问题是否已经得到了令人满意的解决。流通和生产的关系可能已经被放在适当的视角中了。但是，如卡尔·科尔什所要求的，法律形式的分析真的已经穷尽了吗？相反的第一个迹象是基本事实，即对于这样的形式分析，帕舒卡尼斯及其继承人在描述法律对商品形式的‘功能’或其‘反射’之前，都没能发展出什么。帕舒卡尼斯的方法本身仍然相当方案化，因为他仅仅是将商品形式与法律形式并列。正如以下的批评将会显示，这种缺乏形式分析导致了进一步的混乱和简化。 2.5.2 民法作为主要法律 与‘流通指控’密切相关的批评已经由汉斯·凯尔森提出：对于帕舒卡尼斯来说，‘所有法律都是私法’，而‘公法不过是资产阶级法学家的意识形态’。这对于刑法来说也同样适用，其特殊性根本没有发展。帕舒卡尼斯实际上并未忽视这一可能的反对。相反，他特别注意到私法是‘每个商品生产社会的理性原则’。他认为，它代表了核心的‘法律本身’，其他法律领域只是其变种，因为在商品生产社会中，最不同的关系‘接近原型商业关系’。特别是等价原则被普遍化，正如他在刑法案例中试图展示的。但在这一点上，他并不真正令人信服。因此，诺伯特·赖希在1972年写道，‘如果一个人真正想理解帕舒卡尼斯在法理学上的工作，一个人必须不要忘记，帕舒卡尼斯这里并没有真正提出一个一般法律理论，而是一个民法理论’。这归因于帕舒卡尼斯对商品所有者之间的关系理解为基本的——这种关系产生了法律，并且是法律的来源。因此，通过将法律概念归因于商品形式，民法理论因此产生了？安东尼奥·内格里大约在同一时期批评了帕舒卡尼斯作品中的‘私法神话’。这是他概念中最令人失望的方面（‘这可能是真的！’）。他宣称，对外部规范设置权威的臣服的想法与法律形式无关，否认了‘在其最高阶段，资本主义发展’正带来这样一种公共法——一种只赋予资产阶级法律辩证自主权的公共法。他对‘国家控制的规范性的抨击’太过分了，因为它让资产阶级社会的对立裂缝在私法的组织元素下消失了：‘这样，私人在法律秩序的创立功能的激进主义中被极端地提升，这纯粹是一种错觉\'，这里两点批评的联系变得清晰。对于内格里来说，国家形式是根本社会对立的表达。一个基于剥削的社会不能仅基于市场法则来再生产自己，因此也不能被简化为私法。在这个意义上忽视国家法（即公法和刑法意义上）是一种错觉。 导致这种对民法过度的原因是什么？首先透露出来的是马克思主义观点，即民法比公法更接近生产，因为‘它记录了物质生产主体的关系和相互要求\'。此外，必须注意这里的历史背景。因为一个类似的，尽管不是马克思主义的，观点在1913年由被认为是法社会学创始人的尤金·埃利希提出，当他回应凯尔森和法律实证主义时表示，由国家设立的法律规范与人们的法律关系和法学法律相比是微不足道的。此外，在民法的方法论中，自由法的理论因其对司法解释的教义而变得有力，该教义旨在从法律的固定字面上解放法官认知。这基于对法规本身始终不完整的理解。 此外，帕舒卡尼斯继续反对由启蒙时代理论塑造的理性主义幻想：资本主义社会可以通过意识形态的规范建立自主自律。然而，必须指出，通过过分估计对立立场，他成了一个普遍的陈词滥调的受害者，即可以在分析层面之外将公共与私人领域、国家与市场分开；在这方面，我们必须同意内格里的观点。只有在这种绝对化的创造中，假设市场能够自我调节，一个法律领域才可能优先于另一个领域。在这种历史上将私法和公法分开为之前并存的单独法律事项的分割中——例如在普鲁士通用法中就发生了这种情况——忽略它们共享的背景所在的风险就体现了。因此新自由主义理论已经宣布了‘私法社会’。在这个背景下，克劳斯·冈特指出，将现代自然法和合理性理论解读为好像‘私法“首先”到来，即功能上和时间上在资产阶级社会的公法之前’是有充分理由的。然而，这些解释对私人自治总是与强制力量相连的事实沉默不语，例如在康德或洛克中。因此，从社会整体中的抽象不仅在这里，而且在帕舒卡尼斯处导致了‘私法神话’。此外，忽视公法尤其在福利国家时代显示出其弱点。因为它的建立特别导致了表面上私人领域的巨大公共法律化——这是帕舒卡尼斯出于历史原因无法想象的。 然而，批评尤其澄清了一件事：类似于流通领域的问题（显著的是，私法是流通领域的理想法律类型），缺乏形式分析在这里也显示出其负面后果。这也在下一个批评点中显现。”"},{"prompt":"请将“2.5.3 Economism Without a form analysis, the impression is easily created that what matters is to derive law from the commodity, in the sense of deriving the so-called ‘superstructures’ from ‘the economy’. Law then appears to be reduced to a mere ‘reflex’, an ideology of ‘true’ reality, without its own momentum, without the relative autonomy evoked by Franz Neumann. Thus, Pashukanis seems to entangle himself in contradictions, because law simply cannot be a necessary real ‘function’ of commodity exchange and at the same time a mere reflex, a mere mystification of market operations. Kelsen in particular interprets the theory of the commodity guardian as an economic one, when he alleges that ‘Pashukanis imitates Marx’s economic interpretation of political phenomena by reducing, in the field of jurisprudence, legal phenomena to economic phenomena ...’201 Tellingly, this critique is mainly picked up by another theoretical tradition, which I will present in the second part of the following chapter. This approach, which goes back to Louis Althusser, rejects the analysis of the commodity form for reasons of principle. Thus Nicos Poulantzas takes up Althusser’s classic separation into a ‘young’ and a ‘mature’ Marx, and only acknowledges the latter and rejects the former as still determined by Hegel und Feuerbach.202 The central objection is that the various levels of society are conceptualised as though they were produced by a creative subject of society, a centre or an essential being - and that this could be traced back to Hegel. Every level is thus simply nothing but the expression of the central subject, which gives it its meaning. With Marxists, Hegel’s ‘absolute spirit’ is merely replaced by the ‘economy’ or the ‘social class’ - the principle, however, remains, so that one can speak of a simple ‘reversal’.203 This fundamental dilemma concerning Hegel is the reason that Pashukanis too can only understand law as the immediate reflex of the economic base204 and thus succumbs to a purely instrumentalist conception of the superstructure: ‘Like a mere appendage law contents itself to follow the twists and turns of the economic base more or less faithfully’^5 Because law is actually nothing other than the reflection of the base, in principle Pashukanis also cannot establish his own legal theory, for accordingly law as a specific object of scientific research cannot exist.206 Neither could the individual social classes be analysed in their specificity, nor their relations between each other, for: ‘One can only speak of relations between two terms, when both as such exist in and through their relation and their relation is based on their specificity and autonomy’.207 In Pashukanis’ expressions such as ‘mystification’ and ‘illusion’, Poulantzas recognises the theory of the young Marx, for whom the levels of the superstructure (thus also law) were understood according to the model of ‘alienation’: that is as false and deceitful phenomena, ‘whose only function it is to disguise the nature of social reality, which consists of human beings as such - the concrete individuals’. They are, in other words, nothing but mere ideology. ‘This is the “humanist” conception of Marxism, which continues to cause harm amongst Marxist researchers even today’^8 In the mid-1990s Jens Christian Müller-Tuckfeld and Andrea Maihofer reassert this thesis of ‘Pashukanis’s eco- nomism’209 or that of a ‘legal theory without analysis of law’.2W This critique of Pashukanis effectively points out an insufficiently complex and not problematised understanding of the relation of ‘base and superstructure’. The reduction of law’s function to that of making commodity exchange possible through legal subjects, the mythology of private law and the partial talk of ‘reflex’ are attached to a one-dimensional determining logic. It is, however, noticeable that the critics do not really make an effort to acknowledge the ambiguities of Pashukanis’ approach, and to engage more extensively with his intended goal?11 Poulantzas and Müller-Tuckfeld get by without representing his theory at all, while Maihofer subjects Pashukanis to something of a hermeneutics of reckoning, which does not live up to its claim of taking the ‘theoretical significance of an author like Pashukanis’212 seriously - although this significance is nonetheless universally recognised. As soon as ‘Hegelian Marxism’ is diagnosed, Althusser’s verdict is pronounced. That Pashukanis, for example, defined himself against a ‘hopeless subject- ivism’213 which believed that the law or the state only exist in the imagination of individuals, and insists on their materiality (‘What a pity that the practice of the political power struggle radically contradicts this psychological view of the state, confronting us at every step with objective material factors’)^4 is ignored. This is much too facile a way to deal with Pashukanis. Poulantzas mentions him in the same context as his colleague Stucka, without developing the significant difference between the two, namely Pashukanis’ specific innovation that law has to be deciphered by way of an analysis of form. The commodity form as such is equated with the ‘economy’ in a most problematic reduction- ism that was already developed by Kelsen. Only in this way can the strong assumption of ‘economism’ and essentialism even be preserved with regard to Pashukanis. For his notion that the analysis of the commodity form had not been used at all for the study of the ‘legal superstructure’215 was more centrally focused on the ‘reified social context’, the fetishistic manner in which human beings organise their social relations. That Poulantzas and his successors can misunderstand Pashukanis as economistic is connected to the lack of a form analysis. 2.5.4 The Withering Away Thesis Finally, his suggestion that the law would have to ‘wither away’ was attacked. Here what is at stake is the significant question, already addressed by Neumann, of to what extent law has emancipatory potential. Pashukanis is even more sceptical than Neumann of this hope that we have gotten to know through Habermas. With his concept of the withering away of the law Pashukanis, picks up directly from Marx and Lenin. In Marx’s analysis of the Social-Democrats’ Gotha Program, the foundation of the ‘withering away’ thesis is laid: Marx accuses the social democrats of remaining attached to bourgeois law in their programme with the use of the term ‘equal right, for the principle of equivalence forms the basis of the commodity-exchanging society.216 This was not surprising, as law can never be higher than the level of development of a society. An idea that makes sense at one particular time, can at another become ‘obsolete verbal rubbish’^7 In a higher phase of communist society it would not make sense to think in those categories, for after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labour, and thereby also the antithesis between mental and physical labour, has vanished; after labour has become not only a means of life but life’s prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-round development of the individual, and all the springs of common wealth flow more abundantly, only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needsP8 It only makes sense to talk of ‘equal rights’ in bourgeois society, whereas a communist one is based upon a principle other than commodity exchange - thus bourgeois law also loses its significance. The term Withering away\\", on the other hand, comes from Friedrich Engels, who talks in Anti-Dühring of the withering away of the state: at the moment when the state really represents all of society, it renders itself superfluous: ‘State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not “abolished”. It dies out’.219 It falls to Lenin to connect those ideas in 1917 in political practice as well as theoretically. In his text State and Revolution, which contains the programme of the October Revolution, he above all addresses the question of how the transition from capitalist to communist conditions could be possible. If in Engels we already see that the state cannot simply be abolished, Lenin also suspects that it is impossible to simply abolish social practices. People would rather have to gradually ‘become accustomed’ to new habits.220 The coercive apparatus of the state, which is necessary in bourgeois society to oppress the exploited part of the population, would become unnecessary in a communist society, which is no longer based on exploitation and want. ‘With the removal of this chief cause, the state will inevitably begin to “wither away”’.221 The metaphor of ‘withering away’ is connected to a particular concept of development. Lenin thus assumed that the ‘machine for the suppression of one class’222 was still necessary during the transition, because in the ‘lower phases of communism’ (socialism), defined as a ‘transitional state’ ‘freed from capitalist slavery, from the untold horrors, savagery, absurdities, and infamies of capitalist exploitation’, people223 do not become different subjects from one day to the next - particularly the old ruling class. The goal is, however, the ‘higher phase of communism’, which Marx speaks of in the above quotation, in which people have learned to observe ‘the elementary rules of social intercourse that have been known for centuries and repeated for thousands of years in all copybook maxims ... without force, without coercion\'.274 ‘Bourgeois law’ does not stop in the first phase either. It is significant that for Lenin and Marx it was already out of the question to speak of proletarian law in this transitional phase, for this cannot exist any more than can a communist state. State and law are in his understanding capitalist forms and as such remain only significant during the transition.225 Bourgeois law thus has the role of functioning as ‘regulator (determining factor)’ in the distribution of goods and labour amongst the members of society^6 because this would not yet work without rules of law (and this is a defect): ‘[f]or if we are not to indulge in utopianism we must not think that, having overthrown capitalism, people will at once learn to work for society without any rules of law. Besides, the abolition of capitalism does not immediately create the economic prerequisites for such a change?77 In bourgeois law, which is designed to regulate the distribution of labour and products, the state is also presupposed, ‘for law is nothing without an apparatus capable of enforcing the observance of the rule of law’.228 The economic preconditions for the withering away have been noted by Marx: all-round development of the individuals and their productive forces, co-operative wealth, ‘i.e., when people have become so accustomed to observing the fundamental rules of social intercourse and when their labor has become so productive that they will voluntarily work according to their ability ... There will then be no need for society, in distributing products, to regulate the quantity to be received by each; each will take freely “according to his needs”, without any control over the labor of the individual citizen, any quantity of truffles, cars, pianos, etc’?77 It seems as though Pashukanis had a similar idea in mind with the replacement of law by merely ‘technical regulations’, that is, rules of such a kind that they do not have to proceduralise the dispute, but only resolve organisational issues. In contrast to Neumann, Pashukanis thus connects with a Marxist tradition which stresses the historical character of social forms and thus denies that ‘law’ is an eternally valid category, if only to regulate - as Franz Neumann argues - the eternally existing quarrels between people. Law in general is for Pashukanis connected with the bourgeois capitalist society. The laws of antiquity and of feudalism were only embryonic predecessors of law, which reaches its peak under capitalism. If law still persists in a supposedly socialist society, it is a remnant230 or residue231 of the still commodity-producing society.”翻译为中文","completion":"2.5.3 经济主义 在没有形式分析的情况下，很容易产生这样的印象：重要的是要从商品中导出法律，就像从“经济”中导出所谓的“上层建筑”。然后，法律似乎被还原为仅仅是“反射”，一个“真实”现实的意识形态，没有自己的动力，没有弗朗茨·诺伊曼唤起的相对自主性。因此，帕舒卡尼斯似乎陷入了矛盾，因为法律根本不能是商品交换的必要实际“功能”，同时又仅仅是反射，市场操作的纯粹神秘化。特别是凯尔森将商品守护者理论解读为经济学理论，他声称“帕舒卡尼斯通过在法律领域将法律现象还原为经济现象，模仿了马克思对政治现象的经济解释......” 值得注意的是，这一批评主要被另一种理论传统接受，我将在接下来的章节的第二部分中介绍。这种方法，追溯到路易斯·阿尔都塞，出于原则原因拒绝商品形式的分析。因此，尼科斯·普兰扎斯接受了阿尔都塞将马克思分为“年轻”和“成熟”两期的经典划分，并且只承认后者，拒绝前者仍然受到黑格尔和费尔巴哈的决定。中心反对意见是，社会的各个层级被概念化为仿佛由社会的创造性主体、中心或本质实体产生——而这可以追溯到黑格尔。每个层面因此仅仅是中心主体的表达，赋予它意义。对于马克思主义者来说，黑格尔的“绝对精神”仅仅被“经济”或“社会阶级”取代——原则仍然存在，因此可以说是一种简单的“颠倒”。这关于黑格尔的根本困境是帕舒卡尼斯也只能将法律理解为经济基础的直接反射，从而屈服于对上层建筑的纯粹工具主义概念：“法律像一个单纯的附属物一样满足于或多或少忠实地跟随经济基础的起起伏伏”。因为法律实际上不过是基础的反映，原则上帕舒卡尼斯也无法建立自己的法律理论，因为相应地作为科学研究的特定对象的法律就不存在。个别社会阶级及其相互关系也无法在其特殊性中被分析，因为：“只有当两个术语本身在其关系中存在并通过其关系及其关系基于它们的特殊性和自主性时，才能谈论两个术语之间的关系”。在帕舒卡尼斯的表达如“神秘化”和“幻觉”中，普兰扎斯认出了年轻的马克思的理论，对他来说上层建筑的层级（因此也包括法律）根据“异化”的模式被理解：即作为虚假和欺骗的现象，“它们唯一的功能是掩盖社会现实的本质，即人类本身——具体的个体”。换句话说，它们不过是纯粹的意识形态。“这就是马克思主义的‘人文主义’观念，直到今天仍对马克思主义研究者造成伤害”。到了1990年代中期，詹斯·克里斯蒂安·穆勒-图克菲尔德和安德烈亚·迈霍费再次提出“帕舒卡尼斯的经济主义”或“没有法律分析的法律理论”的论点。 这对帕舒卡尼斯的批评有效地指出了对“基础和上层建筑”关系理解的不够复杂和未被问题化。将法律的功能简化为通过法律主体使商品交换成为可能的神话，私法神话和部分“反射”谈论附着于单向决定逻辑。然而，值得注意的是，批评者并没有真正努力去承认帕舒卡尼斯方法的模糊性，以及更广泛地参与他的预期目标。普兰扎斯和穆勒-图克菲尔德在没有代表他的理论的情况下就通过了，而迈霍费则对帕舒卡尼斯进行了某种清算式的解读，这并不符合其声称要严肃对待“像帕舒卡尼斯这样的作者的理论意义”的要求——尽管这种意义无论如何都是普遍认可的。一旦被诊断为“黑格尔马克思主义”，阿尔都塞的判决就被宣布了。 例如，帕舒卡尼斯自我界定为反对“无望的主观主义”，该主观主义认为法律或国家只存在于个人的想象中，并坚持它们的物质性（“遗憾的是，政治权力斗争的实践从根本上与这种对国家的心理视角相矛盾，在我们的每一步都与客观的物质因素相遇”）被忽略了。这种处理帕舒卡尼斯的方式过于轻率。普兰扎斯将他与他的同事斯图卡放在同一个背景中提及，但没有发展出两者之间的重要区别，即帕舒卡尼斯的具体创新是必须通过形式分析来破译法律。商品形式本身被等同于“经济”中最有问题的还原主义，这已经由凯尔森发展出来。只有这样，才能保持对帕舒卡尼斯的强烈“经济主义”和本质主义假设。因为他认为，对商品形式的分析根本没用于“法律上层建筑”的研究，更多地集中在“物化的社会背景”上，即人类组织其社会关系的拜物教方式。普兰扎斯及其继承人误解帕舒卡尼斯为经济主义者，与缺乏形式分析有关。 2.5.4 消亡论 最后，他关于法律将不得不“消亡”的建议受到了攻击。这里涉及到诺伊曼已经提出的重要问题，即法律在多大程度上具有解放潜力。帕舒卡尼斯比诺伊曼更加怀疑我们通过哈贝马斯了解到的这种希望。通过他的法律消亡概念，帕舒卡尼斯直接继承了马克思和列宁的思想。 在马克思对社会民主党哥达纲领的分析中，奠定了“消亡”论文的基础：马克思指责社会民主党在他们的纲领中使用“平等权”一词仍然坚持资产阶级法律，因为等价原则构成了商品交换社会的基础。这并不令人惊讶，因为法律永远不可能高于社会的发展水平。在特定时间有意义的想法，在另一个时间可能成为“过时的废话”。在共产主义社会的更高阶段，这些类别的思考没有意义，因为 在个体对劳动分工的奴役性从属关系以及智力劳动和体力劳动之间的对立消失之后；在劳动不仅成为生活的手段而且成为生活的首要需求之后；在个体的全面发展随着生产力的增长，共同财富的源泉更加丰富之后，才能完全跨越资产阶级权利的狭窄视野，社会才能在其旗帜上铭刻：“各尽所能，按需分配”。 只有在资产阶级社会中才谈得上“平等权”，而共产主义社会则基于与商品交换不同的原则——因此资产阶级法律也失去了它的意义。 另一方面，“消亡”一词来自弗里德里希·恩格斯，他在《反杜林论》中谈到了国家的消亡：在国家真正代表了全社会的时刻，它就会变得多余：“国家对社会关系的干预在一个又一个领域变得多余，然后自行消失；人的统治被物的管理以及生产过程的指导所取代。国家不是被‘废除’。它会消亡。” 列宁在1917年以政治实践和理论上将这些想法联系起来。在他的著作《国家与革命》中，包含了十月革命的纲领，他主要讨论了如何可能从资本主义条件转变为共产主义条件。如果在恩格斯那里我们已经看到国家不能简单地被废除，列宁也怀疑社会实践不能简单地被废除。人们将不得不逐渐“习惯”新的习惯。在资产阶级社会中压迫被剥削人口的国家强制机器，在共产主义社会中不再有必要，因为后者不再基于剥削和匮乏。“随着这一主要原因的消除，国家将不可避免地开始‘消亡’”。“消亡”的隐喻与特定的发展概念相联系。因此，列宁认为，“在过渡时期，压迫一个阶级的‘机器’仍然是必要的，因为在‘共产主义的较低阶段’（社会主义），被定义为从资本主义奴役中解放出来的‘过渡性国家’，‘从资本主义剥削的无数恐怖、野蛮、荒谬和无耻行径中解放出来’，人们不会在一天之内变成不同的主体——尤其是旧的统治阶级。然而，目标是马克思在上面引用中所说的‘共产主义的更高阶段’，在这一阶段，人们已经学会遵守‘几个世纪以来已知并在所有字帖中重复了数千年的社会交往的基本规则......无需强制，无需胁迫’。 “资产阶级法律”在第一阶段也不会停止。对于列宁和马克思来说，已经不可能在这个过渡阶段谈论无产阶级法律，因为这和共产主义国家一样不存在。在他的理解中，国家和法律是资本主义形式，作为这样的形式只在过渡期间保持重要性。因此资产阶级法律的角色是作为在社会成员之间分配商品和劳动的“调节器（决定因素）”，因为这还不能不依靠法律规则来运作（并且这是一个缺陷）：“如果我们不想沉溺于乌托邦，我们就不得不相信，推翻了资本主义之后，人们会立刻学会在没有任何法律规则的情况下为社会工作。此外，废除资本主义并不立即创造出这种变化的经济前提。”在资产阶级法律中，旨在调节劳动和产品分配的法律也预设了国家的存在，“因为没有能够强制执行法律规则的机构，法律就毫无意义。”马克思指出了消亡的经济前提：个体及其生产力的全面发展，合作的财富，“也就是说，当人们已经习惯于遵守社会交往的基本规则，并且当他们的劳动变得如此有生产力以至于他们将自愿根据自己的能力工作...社会在分配产品时，无需对每个人应该接收的数量进行规范；每个人将根据自己的需要自由地取用，无论是松露，汽车，钢琴等，都不会对个别公民的劳动进行任何控制。” 看起来，帕舒卡尼斯心中有一个类似的想法，即用仅仅“技术规则”代替法律，即这样的规则，它们不必程序化争端，而只需解决组织问题。与诺伊曼相反，帕舒卡尼斯因此与一种强调社会形式历史性质的马克思主义传统相联系，从而否认“法律”是一个永恒有效的类别，即使只是像弗朗茨·诺伊曼争论的那样——调节人们之间永恒存在的争执。对于帕舒卡尼斯来说，法律总体上与资产阶级资本主义社会相联系。古代和封建主义的法律只是法律的胚胎形式的前身，法律在资本主义下达到"},{"prompt":"请将“It seems as though Pashukanis had a similar idea in mind with the replacement of law by merely ‘technical regulations’, that is, rules of such a kind that they do not have to proceduralise the dispute, but only resolve organisational issues. In contrast to Neumann, Pashukanis thus connects with a Marxist tradition which stresses the historical character of social forms and thus denies that ‘law’ is an eternally valid category, if only to regulate - as Franz Neumann argues - the eternally existing quarrels between people. Law in general is for Pashukanis connected with the bourgeois capitalist society. The laws of antiquity and of feudalism were only embryonic predecessors of law, which reaches its peak under capitalism. If law still persists in a supposedly socialist society, it is a remnant230 or residue231 of the still commodity-producing society. Pashukanis’s withering away thesis has been criticised from various perspectives. Thus Norbert Reich reproaches Pashukanis that this ‘fundamental critique of law’ could only be achieved by reducing the concept of law to the society of commodity exchange.232 He basically repeats here his criticism of the seemingly narrow concept of law, which is only adapted to civil law: ‘With this, however, little is achieved, for other areas of social life remain which also have to be regulated by norms, albeit not by legal norms’.233 But Reich’s critique fails to reach its target, because Pashukanis - as has been shown - only continues the approach of Marx, Engels and Lenin; and Lenin in particular did not only limit law and the state to guaranteeing civil laws, but understood them as forms that are intended to ‘hold down’ the subaltern in a historical situation of capitalist exploitation and want. Andreas Harms, on the other hand, problematises the ‘historical teleology of Marxism’234 that is expressed here: ‘Pashukanis also seems to believe in an immanent reason of history which lets law first reach full maturity, before it withers away .J235 Antonio Negri, meanwhile, notes that the question of the transition was also central for Pashukanis. Not a reason of history [Vernunft der Geschichte], but only class struggle would lead to the withering away. Pashukanis has this concept of the opening up of a path towards transition^6 This is ‘a process of proletarian estrangement interpreted by the struggle against any form of institutional actualization of the relations of force between the classes that confront themselves. There is no alternative use of law that can replace this process of struggles’^7 Harms argues moreover8 that the concept of technical regulation does not remove the problem of coercion: ‘In this case, however, not following technical regulations, just as not following a legal norm, is also a reason for the state to intevene’ - unless there is consensus in society. Ultimately Pashukanis seems unable to completely liberate himself from the idea that, even in a far-away future, enforceable and general regulations will be necessary. ‘Thus, Pashukanis is unable to produce a transition from a critical reconstruction of the legal form to an intellectually coherent anticipation of a social formation without abstract formalised rules’.239 Apart from the fact that it is an astonishing demand to expect an author to anticipate a future society in which today’s contradictions are resolved, this critique of Pashukanis also seems flawed to me. The objection would apply to Franz Neumann, who considered the dispute in need of regulation as the fundamental precondition of any society. However, Pashukanis assumes on the contrary that social conditions will change in such a way that people are able to organise their relationships without legal norms. That they, to paraphrase Lenin, are able to work for the common good and to recognise it as the condition for their freedom. Perhaps Lenin’s term ‘habit’ is more appropriate than that of ‘technical regulation’; but both imply that an enforcing apparatus must no longer be necessary. Jens Christian Müller-Tuckfeld finally refers in the context of the withering away thesis to ‘orthodox Marxism’,240 in order to criticise the notion that law is merely an external coercive force. However, if legal norms are not external to the subjects, but inscribed in their practices, it would be naive to imagine that law can wither away in a different society because the state has been abolished. Law and state would then have exclusively repressive components. Reflections about ideological mechanisms of power, such as those undertaken by Althusser and Gramsci, or about disciplinary and biopolitical mechanisms of power in the spirit of Foucault (more on this below) were still alien to Marxists. How the political subject, the working class, becomes hegemonic, that is, how it can make its aims universal, was ignored in favour of the idea that the repressive apparatuses simply had to disappear. One must, however, not overlook that such concepts only emerged later in the history of theory and that the withering away thesis was certainly also an undogmatic moment in Pashukanis’ theory, because it at least articulated the notion that there are no everlasting social relations. Withering away is precisely not identical with ‘destroying’, but contains the elements of a gradual redundancy. Significantly, under Stalinist persecution it was precisely the withering away thesis that Pashukanis was made to revoke. He now wrote about his earlier assumption that communism and law are incompatible that this is without a doubt also a grave formal mistake ... For [this] prevents from being addressed the question of Soviet law as a particular law of the transition period - a law that is fundamentally different from the law of bourgeois-capitalist society.241 His early insight that the legal form and the commodity form go together had to be given up politically at a time when the State Marxism of the Soviet Union no longer wanted to know about it, because while it had abolished private property, it had not done away with the commodity form.242 The withering away thesis contains at the same time a model for the transition to another society. In its principal considerations it has a rather emancipatory outlook. The model of transition remains, however, problematic, as it wants to retain the contradictory institutions of state and law for a certain time - and thus dominance, coercion and oppression. That the practice of Real Socialism has disproved the transition thesis is almost banal. Which theoretical alternatives could have been imagined is, however, much less so. 2.5.5 Summary With the second Marxist approach in legal theory a further element was added to the analysis of power relations. While Neumann and Kirchheimer referred rather to the political writings as well as to the surplus value and class theory of Marx, Pashukanis started from the first chapter of the first volume of Capital and thus with the analysis of the commodity form and the theory of fetishism. Marx himself, who had connected both moments in one theory, assumed that class struggle takes place mediated through the commodity form, and that both moments are thus connected.243 But neither the critical theorists nor Pashukanis make this connection. The questions that remained unanswered in the last chapter, in particular about the totality of capitalist societies as well as the ‘relative autonomy’ of the law, also represented gaps for Pashukanis. He provides, however, a different answer to the question of law’s emancipatory potential. Instead of locating it in its potential ‘ethical function’, he situates law altogether as part of a strategy of power which must be overcome. The withering away thesis is the final consequence of the form analysis. That is to say, precisely that analysis which, according to the understanding reached here, Pashukanis actually only called for, but did not provide it. The ‘reified social context’ is demonstrated in the commodity exchange without basic reflections that could make clear that this is a structuring principle of society, and not only an ‘economic’ fact. Pashukanis had this in view; in this respect the charge of economism, as well as that of a reduction to the sphere of circulation and to private law, does not apply. However, he could not realise this in his execution, which remained fragmentary due to the historical circumstances in which he worked, so the critique of what he actually achieved nonetheless contains valid points. Pashukanis’ unfulfilled potential thus lies in a further continuation of his work from this point. How Marxist legal theorists of the 1970s attempted to solve this problem will therefore be analysed in the next step. Afterwards I return to the alternative approach in the tradition of Althusser and Gramsci, which also reached its endpoint in the 1970s. CHAPTER 7 Renaissance and Crisis of Marxism Since the 1970s In the context of the student movement and the euphoria over reforms of the ‘social-democrat era’, legal theory in the undogmatic Marxist tradition was revived during the 1970s. Of particular importance were the two collected volumes edited by Hubert Rottleutbner (1975) and Norbert Reich (1972), as well as the 1971-3 issues of Kritische Justiz. Alongside this there was a temporary renaissance of a (at the time still called Marxist) left-wing legal theory in West Germany, and also French, Italian and us-American debate. Authors such as Joachim Pereis, Norbert Reich, Wolfgang Abendroth, Thomas Blanke, Wolf Paul, Oskar Negt, Ulrich K. Preuß, Nicos Poulantzas, Burkhard Tuschling, Umberto Cerroni and Toni Negri or Monique Chemillier-Gendreau, Isaac D. Balbus and Sol Picciotto engaged here with the issues raised by Pashukanis, or Franz Neumann and Otto Kirchheimer. They took particularly great interest in the activities of the state, its room for manoeuvre and steering potential. This was due to the expanding Keynesian welfare-state and the ‘illusions of the social state’ it created, but also to the early crisis of the Fordist formation. The concentration on the ‘capitalist state’ was not least visible in the scale of the ‘state derivation debate’. This was also the time when the independent significance of law was relegated to the background: considered an aspect of the state, it was frequently subsumed under it. Until now it has not escaped from this embrace. The discussions at the time were at first attempts to bring ‘fragmentary approaches’ into a ‘systematic engagement with the questions of the development and effects of legal norms or legal-political strategies’. ”翻译为中文","completion":"似乎帕舒卡尼斯心中有一个类似的想法，即用仅仅“技术规则”代替法律，即这样的规则，它们不必程序化争端，而只需解决组织问题。与诺伊曼相反，帕舒卡尼斯因此与一种强调社会形式历史性质的马克思主义传统相联系，从而否认“法律”是一个永恒有效的类别，即使只是像弗朗茨·诺伊曼争论的那样——调节人们之间永恒存在的争执。对于帕舒卡尼斯来说，法律总体上与资产阶级资本主义社会相联系。古代和封建主义的法律只是法律的胚胎形式的前身，法律在资本主义下达到顶峰。如果法律在一个所谓的社会主义社会中仍然存在，它是残留物或者残余物，是仍然存在的商品生产社会的残留。 帕舒卡尼斯的消亡论从不同角度受到了批评。因此，诺伯特·赖希批评帕舒卡尼斯，这种“对法律的根本批评”只能通过将法律概念还原为商品交换社会来实现。他基本上在这里重复了他对看似狭窄的法律概念的批评，这种法律概念只适应于民法：“然而，这样做几乎无法取得成就，因为还有其他需要被规范的社会生活领域，尽管不是通过法律规范。但是赖希的批评没有达到目标，因为已经展示了帕舒卡尼斯——只是继续了马克思、恩格斯和列宁的方法；特别是列宁并不只将法律和国家限制为保障民事权利，而是理解它们为旨在“压制”资本主义剥削和贫穷历史情境中的下层阶级的形式。 另一方面，安德烈亚斯·哈姆斯则问题化了这里表达的“马克思主义的历史唯物论”：“帕舒卡尼斯似乎也相信历史的内在理性，这让法律首先达到完全成熟，然后才消亡。”与此同时，安东尼奥·内格里指出，过渡的问题对帕舒卡尼斯也是核心。不是历史的理性，而只有阶级斗争会导致消亡。帕舒卡尼斯拥有这个开启向过渡道路的概念。这是“通过斗争对抗任何形式的阶级力量关系的制度化实现的无产阶级异化过程。没有其他使用法律的方式可以替代这一斗争过程。” 哈姆斯还争论说，技术规则的概念并没有解决胁迫的问题：“然而，在这种情况下，不遵循技术规则，就像不遵循法律规范一样，也是国家干预的理由”——除非社会有共识。最终，帕舒卡尼斯似乎无法完全从即使在遥远的未来，也将需要可执行和普遍规则的想法中解脱出来。“因此，帕舒卡尼斯无法从对法律形式的批判性重建过渡到对没有抽象规范化规则的社会形态的智力连贯的预见。”除了要求一位作者预见一个今日矛盾被解决的未来社会是令人惊讶的，我认为这种对帕舒卡尼斯的批评也是有缺陷的。这一反对意见适用于弗朗茨·诺伊曼，他认为需要调节的争端是任何社会的基本前提。然而，帕舒卡尼斯恰恰相反地假设，社会条件将以这样一种方式改变，人们能够在没有法律规范的情况下组织他们的关系。用列宁的话来转述，他们能够为公共利益工作并认识到它是他们自由的条件。也许列宁的“习惯”一词比“技术规则”更合适；但两者都暗示，强制执行机构将不再是必要的。 詹斯·克里斯蒂安·穆勒-图克菲尔德最终在消亡论的背景下提到了“正统马克思主义”，以批评法律仅仅是外部强制力量的观念。然而，如果法律规范不是主体外在的，而是写在他们的实践中，那么想象在不同的社会中因为国家被废除而法律可以消亡就是天真的。法律和国家那时将只有压迫性成分。阿尔都塞和格拉姆西的意识形态权力机制的思考，或者符合福柯精神的纪律和生物政治权力机制的思考（下文将更多讨论）对马克思主义者来说还是陌生的。如何将政治主体、工人阶级，成为霸权，即如何使其目标普遍化，而不是假设压迫机构简单地消失，被忽略了。 然而，不应该忽视的是，这些概念是在理论史上后来才出现的，帕舒卡尼斯的消亡论当然也是他理论中一个非教条的时刻，因为它至少表达了社会关系不是永恒的观念。消亡正是不同于“破坏”，而包含了逐渐过时的元素。值得注意的是，在斯大林主义迫害下，正是消亡论被帕舒卡尼斯被迫撤回。他现在写道他早期的假设，即共产主义和法律不相容“无疑也是一个严重的形式上的错误......因为[这]阻止了将苏维埃法律作为过渡时期特殊法律的问题得到解决——这种法律与资产阶级-资本主义社会的法律根本不同。”在苏联的国家马克思主义不再想知道过去的时候，他的早期洞察——法律形式和商品形式相伴随——不得不在政治上放弃，因为尽管废除了私有财产，但并没有取消商品形式。 消亡论同时包含了向另一个社会过渡的模型。在其主要考虑中，它有一个相当解放性的前景。然而，过渡模型仍然是问题的，因为它希望在一段时间内保留国家和法律的矛盾制度——因此也就是保留支配、强制和压迫。真实社会主义的实践已经证明了过渡论是荒谬的。然而，可以想象哪些理论替代方案则没那么明显了。 2.5.5 总结 随着第二种马克思主义法理学方法的加入，对权力关系的分析增添了进一步的元素。虽然诺伊曼和基希海默更多地参考了马克思的政治著作以及剩余价值和阶级理论，帕舒卡尼斯则从《资本论》第一卷的第一章开始，即从商品形式和拜物教理论开始。马克思自己，将这两个时刻连接在一个理论中，认为阶级斗争是通过商品形式间接发生的，这两个时刻因此是相连的。但是，无论是批判理论家还是帕舒卡尼斯都没有做出这种联系。在上一章中遗留的未解决的问题，特别是关于资本主义社会的整体性以及法律的“相对自主性”，对帕舒卡尼斯来说也是空白。然而，他对法律解放潜力的问题提出了不同的答案。他没有将其潜力定位在其潜在的“伦理功能”，而是将法律完全定位为一种必须克服的权力策略的一部分。消亡论是形式分析的最终结果。也就是说，根据这里达到的理解，帕舒卡尼斯实际上只是呼吁进行这种分析，但并未提供。在商品交换中展示了“物化的社会背景”，没有基本的反思，这些反思可以明确这是社会的一个结构原则，而不仅仅是一个“经济”事实。帕舒卡尼斯对此有所见地；在这方面，经济主义的指控，以及对流通领域和私法的简化指控，并不适用。然而，由于他工作的历史环境，他的执行仍然是零散的，因此对他实际成就的批评仍然包含了有效的观点。 因此，帕舒卡尼斯潜力未实现的地方在于从这一点继续他的工作。因此，接下来将分析1970年代的马克思主义法理学者是如何试图解决这个问题的。之后，我将回到阿尔都塞和格拉姆西传统中的另一种方法，这个方法也在1970年代达到了终点。 第7章 自1970年代以来马克思主义的复兴和危机 在学生运动的背景下以及对“社会民主时代”改革的热情中，1970年代期间的非教条主义马克思主义传统中的法理学复兴了。特别重要的是由胡伯特·罗特卢特布纳（1975年）和诺伯特·赖希（1972年）编辑的两本合集，以及1971-3年《批判性司法》的刊物。与此同时，还有（当时仍被称为马克思主义）西德左翼法理学在法国、意大利和美国辩论中的临时复兴。像约阿希姆·佩雷斯、诺伯特·赖希、沃尔夫冈·阿本德罗特、托马斯·布兰克、沃尔夫·保罗、奥斯卡·内格特、乌尔里希·K·普劳斯、尼科斯·普兰扎斯、伯克哈德·图施林、乌姆贝托·切罗尼和托尼·内格里或莫尼克·舍米利耶-甘德罗、艾萨克·D·巴尔巴斯和索尔·皮乔托等作者在这里就帕舒卡尼斯提出的问题，或弗朗茨·诺伊曼和奥托·基希海默的问题进行了探讨。他们特别关注国家的活动、其行动空间和操控潜力。这归因于扩展的凯恩斯福利国家和它创造的“社会国家幻觉”，但也归因于福特主义构建的早期危机。集中讨论“资本主义国家”不仅仅体现在“国家衍生辩论”的规模上。这也是一个时期，独立的法律意义被放到了背后：被认为是国家的一个方面，它经常被归入其下。到目前为止，它还没有摆脱这种困境。 当时的讨论首先是尝试将“零散的方法”带入对法律规范或法律政策策略的发展和影响的“系统性参与”的问题。"},{"prompt":"请将“As an example I will pick out two theory strands with different initial premisses from this debate. They are suitable for different reasons. The first strand develops Pashukanis’ approach further. On this basis, the ideas it presents can be examined as to whether they succeed in filling out the ‘blind spot’ of the legal form analysis described above. The second strand (associated with Nicos Poulantzas and Michel Foucault), on the other hand, is of interest because it explicitly rejects this starting point and instead picks up from Louis Althusser and Antonio Gramsci. After the awakening of the 1960s, the start of the next decade brought the so- called ‘crisis of Marxism’.1 * * * * With the crisis of the Fordist welfare-state and the emergence of multiple social struggles, in particular the new women’s movement, but also the ecology movement and the atypical forms of social struggle on the capitalist periphery, social conflicts expanded to encompass a wide field of issues. Thus ‘the very wealth and plurality of contemporary social struggles has given rise to a theoretical crisis’, which calls into question the centrality of the working class, the role of the revolution as the transition from one type of society to another and the idea of a completely homogenous collective will as well as the primacy of ‘economic laws’ in Marxist concepts. While theory based upon Marx was as a whole challenged to engage in continuous selfexamination, and was successful in doing so in many areas, one must note that legal theory did not survive the crisis: for at its end there was no longer a living Marxist legal theory. The following discussion will show at which points the crisis can be theoretically defined. In this context Michel Foucault’s work becomes particularly significant. On the one hand it is marked by a critical engagement with Marxism, and on the other hand his interest in knowledge relates to social phenomena which allow for the expansion of the theoretical field: ‘madness’, ‘deviance’, and ‘sexuality’. His objections and theoretical shifts lend themselves therefore to a reformulation of Marxist legal theory. counter-statement. Negt’s approach was, however, again not at all a systematic contribution, but his ten theses rather reflected a new beginning. As has already been described with regard to the critique of Pashukanis, his own intervention consisted of bringing the sphere of production into the debate. Here it was central for him that the term ‘production’ not be understood in a narrowly ‘economistic’ way. Production should not be assimilated to an instrumental approach to working material, instruments and organisation, but be identical to the production and reproduction of real life at a historically specific stage of development of the forces and conditions of production, ideas, concepts, and consciousness, that is, of lived relations that are based upon the material activity of individuals: ‘With the production of material goods individuals produce and reproduce at the same time the conditions which define the rules and limits of their actions and behaviour ...’9 The legal form can be explained from this context. The basic theorem is thus: bourgeois law is not based on the general fact that all commodity owners consider each other in their economic transactions as equal and have to recognise each other as such, but rather on the underlying special exchange relation between wage labourers and capitalists. The exchange process wherein law develops is ‘production-mediated exchange’:10 ‘Not all commodities, nor the movement of goods mediated by contracts, but only the commodity labour power is therefore the reference point to derive and explain law’.11 The consequence of this new definition of the derivation’s location remains, however, unclear. Only with Burkhard Tuschling’s Rechtsform und Produktionsverhältnisse (1976) is this undefined connection explained. He starts from Negt’s thesis and takes it further. For in Negt it remained a ‘merely methodological demand’?2 In capitalism, law expands from a social subsection to a system that regulates all social relations. From this it follows that the field of law’s development and regulation cannot be that of circulation (this applies only to pre-capitalist societies) but the ‘capitalist production process’?3 This process is characterised by labour power itself becoming a commodity. Tuschling’s central thesis is therefore that capitalist commodity exchange fulfils the decisive function of this production method, namely ‘the combination of producers and means of pro- duction’.14 The central contradiction of capitalism thus has to take the form of a process, that is, become communicable and thus reproducible in order to make capitalist production possible?5 Law has to be derived from this ‘totality’, not from a partial moment?6 The specific contribution of law is that it regulates and guarantees that the services that buyer and seller of the commodity labour power expect are in fact delivered: realisation of the means of production, replacement of the equivalent of the commodity labour power as well as of a surplus value that exceeds it. The results of the production process are thus organised legally: ‘The law guarantees that in the case of conflict the constitutional state’s instruments of power can be used, in order to safeguard by way of sanctions ... the relationship of the separation of the producers from their means of production that is reproduced and thus newly put in place at the end of the capitalist production process’?7 By ‘totality’ Tuschling understands the contradictory relations of capitalist society, which can be considered as relations of production, as class relations, or precisely as legal relations. Law is thus only ‘a legal aspect of this totality’ or nothing but ‘the same relations of individuals to each other and to the means of production, only seen from a different angle ...’is The relations of production are the totality, which differentiates into ‘relations of production and law’.i9 With regard to form analysis this means that Tuschling understands production as the content and law as its form.20 This content is the basic structure of capitalist society, which represents the natural core of any positive law.21 1.1.2 A Mania for Foundations Maihofer argues in relation to Negt’s intervention that his theses are nothing but a ‘more precise’ definition of the point from which the origin of law can be derived. How law originates is, however, by no means more precisely defined by this.22 Harms argues similarly: ‘Although he differentiates himself from Pashukanis, Negt’s arguments in this context are similar to Pashukanis’?3 Maihofer’s central objection is directed at how Negt’s particular emphasis on production is a vehicle for the notion that production brings forth all social relations from itself as a, so to speak, godlike source of all social existence.24 Rather, production as socially determined has to always already be thought within particular ways of production, practices and forms of consciousness?5 This critique does not seem convincing with regard to Negt, because he defends the same idea with a different terminology, and Maihofer criticises him for precisely the misconception Negt seeks to clear up. When applied to Burkhard Tuschling, however, the criticism hits the mark. For the specificity of Tuschling’s theory consists in how it brings the critique of Pashukanis - virulent to begin with - to a head. But this also means that the immanent problem of this critique is revealed very clearly: the creation and appropriation of surplus value in production is seen as the crucial element of capitalism; therefore, law also has to be connected, rooted in it. Not only law, all social relations are based upon this fundamental problem, are an expression of the subject ‘capital’. Society can thus not be recognised as multi-dimensional and overdetermined by a diversity of contradictions, but has to be reduced to a ‘fundamental contradiction’?6 from which everything can be derived. Besides the fact that this argument is economistic, it also points to a more basic methodological problem, which is ultimately expressed in economism; to an ontological idea of society: ‘the ... assumption that every conceivable existent thing can be reduced’ to the fundamental?7 What Poulantzas and Maihofer thus label Hegelian thinking of the simple contradiction is no less criticised by the Hegel-following Adorno. He calls such a notion a ‘mania for foundations’28 and means by this ‘the belief that everything which exists must be derived from something else, something older or more primordial’?9 This ‘cult of the notion of originality’ contains the claim that the first and earliest was truer, better, and deeper.30 This original is in Tuschling ‘capital as subject of domination’?1 But from where can it ultimately be ‘derived’ that law regulates the ‘core’ of capitalism? Why not only secondary aspects? Why ‘regulation’ and ‘guarantee’ at all? Those premises are obvious choices, which are only hidden by how they seemingly lead back to the fundamental. But the social is an infinitude, ‘not reducible to any underlying unitary principle’. The idea of an original centre of the social therefore no longer makes any sense.32 In particular when Tuschling himself admits that law precisely abstracts from relations of inequality, the argument becomes contra-dictory, if it is at the same time derived from this particular aspect.33 The aspect that goes beyond the equivalent exchange can just as well remain alien to law, as Harms argues34 Furthermore Tuschling misrecognises the double meaning of simple circulation35 It is not merely the historical precondition of capital, ‘pre-capitalist’; it is likewise the precondition of capital within the bourgeois mode of production. 1.1.3 Totality In the mania for foundations we encounter yet again a questionable concept of totality. ‘[H]ow this totality can be grasped in one fell swoop, without its aspects being developed out of each other’36 - this remains Tuschling’s secret. This is only possible because Tuschling understands by totality, not diversity and the inherent momentum of its aspects, but simply the examination of a single relationship from all angles. Everything is in principle ‘capital’. ‘Concrete totality’ is rather visible in the mutual dependence of the individual parts, which can differ from each other so much as to even form polar opposites37 Law has its own density and is not only the expression or outward form of production. And it is precisely this claim that Tuschling cannot live up to. While he thus completely denies the independence of its aspects, Neumann on the other hand struggles with the merely abstract totality of their addition. How to understand society as a totality and consider law in relation to it emerges more and more clearly as the main challenge of the various theoretical strands. 1.2 On the Relationship of Law and State After engaging with those who adhere to the ‘derivation of law’, I will now turn to the ‘school of state derivation’. ‘Pashukanis’ Status as a patron saint of this school is widely accepted, whatever one thinks of the school itself ...’38”翻译为中文","completion":"作为例子，我将从这场辩论中挑选出两个具有不同初始前提的理论流派。它们因不同的原因而适合。第一个流派进一步发展了帕舒卡尼斯的方法。基于此，它提出的观点可以被检验，看它们是否成功填补了上述所描述的法律形式分析的“盲点”。另一方面，第二个流派（与尼科斯·普兰扎斯和米歇尔·福柯相关）之所以引人注目，是因为它明确拒绝了这一出发点，而是从路易斯·阿尔都塞和安东尼奥·格拉姆西那里汲取灵感。 在1960年代的觉醒之后，下一个十年的开始带来了所谓的“马克思主义危机”。随着福特主义福利国家的危机和多重社会斗争的出现，特别是新女性运动，还有生态运动和资本主义边缘地带的非典型形式社会斗争，社会冲突扩展到了广泛的议题领域。因此，“当代社会斗争的丰富多样引发了理论危机”，这质疑了工人阶级的中心地位，革命作为一种社会形态向另一种社会形态转变的角色，以及完全同质的集体意志的概念，以及马克思主义概念中“经济法则”的首要性。虽然基于马克思的理论被整体挑战去进行持续的自我审视，并在许多领域成功做到了这一点，但必须注意，法律理论没有经受住这场危机：因为在危机结束时，已经不再存在活跃的马克思主义法律理论。接下来的讨论将展示这场危机可以在哪些点上被理论化定义。 在这个背景下，米歇尔·福柯的工作变得特别重要。一方面，它以批判性地参与马克思主义为标志，另一方面，他对知识的兴趣涉及到允许扩展理论领域的社会现象：“疯狂”、“偏差”和“性”。因此，他的反对意见和理论转变因此适合于对马克思主义法律理论的改写。 奈格特的方法，然而，再次根本不是一个系统性的贡献，而他的十个论点反映了一个新的开始。 正如之前关于对帕舒卡尼斯批评所描述的，他自己的干预包括将生产领域带入辩论。对他来说，中心问题是“生产”一词不应被狭隘地理解为“经济主义”方式。生产不应被等同于对工作材料、工具和组织的工具性方法，而是与特定历史发展阶段的生产力和生产条件、思想、概念和意识，即基于个人物质活动的生活关系的生产和再生产相同：“通过物质商品的生产，个人同时生产和再生产那些定义他们行动和行为规则和限制的条件......” 法律形式可以从这个背景中被解释。基本定理因此是：资产阶级法律不是基于所有商品所有者在他们的经济交易中视彼此为平等并必须相互认可的一般事实，而是基于工资劳动者和资本家之间的特殊交换关系。法律发展的交换过程是“生产介导的交换”：“因此，不是所有商品，也不是合同介导的商品流动，只有劳动力商品才是导出和解释法律的参照点”。然而，这种新定义的衍生地点的后果仍然不清楚。 只有在布尔克哈德·图施林的《法律形式与生产关系》(1976)中，这种未定义的联系被解释。他从奈格特的论点出发，并将其进一步发展。因为在奈格特那里，它仍然是一个“仅仅是方法论上的要求”。在资本主义中，法律从一个社会子部门扩展到一个调节所有社会关系的系统。由此可知，法律的发展和调节领域不能是流通领域（这只适用于前资本主义社会），而是“资本主义生产过程”。这一过程的特点是劳动力本身变成了一种商品。因此图施林的中心论点是，资本主义商品交换完成了这种生产方式的决定性功能，即“生产者和生产手段的结合”。资本主义的中心矛盾因此必须采取过程的形式，即变得可传达并因此在资本主义生产中变得可复制。法律必须从这个“整体”中衍生出来，而不是从一个部分时刻。法律的特殊贡献是它规范和保证了商品劳动力的买方和卖方所期望的服务确实得到了交付：生产手段的实现，劳动力商品等价物的替换以及超过它的剩余价值的实现。因此，生产过程的结果在法律上得到了组织：“法律保证了在冲突的情况下，可以使用宪政国家的权力工具，通过制裁来保障......在资本主义生产过程结束时再次建立并因此重新确立的生产者与其生产手段分离的关系”。"},{"prompt":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息:

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

timide elle peut penser Quoi de lui dit plusieurs personnalités de fille et comment elle pense d\'un garçon timide","completion":"La perception des garçons timides peut varier grandement en fonction de la personnalité et des expériences personnelles de chaque fille. Voici comment différentes personnalités féminines pourraient percevoir un garçon timide : 1. **La fille extrovertie** : Elle pourrait trouver le garçon timide intrigant et mystérieux. Elle peut voir sa timidité comme un défi ou une énigme à résoudre, poussée par sa propre aisance sociale à vouloir l\'ouvrir davantage et découvrir ce qui se cache derrière son calme apparent. 2. **La fille introvertie** : Elle pourrait se sentir plus en affinité avec le garçon timide, partageant peut-être une compréhension tacite de ce que c\'est que de ne pas être au centre de l\'attention tout le temps. Elle pourrait le trouver rassurant et plus facile à aborder que quelqu\'un de très exubérant. 3. **La fille protectrice** : Elle pourrait voir le garçon timide comme quelqu\'un qui a besoin de protection ou d\'aide pour s\'épanouir. Elle pourrait être tentée de le prendre sous son aile, de l\'encourager et de le soutenir dans ses interactions sociales. 4. **La fille curieuse** : Intriguée par ce qui rend le garçon timide, elle pourrait être poussée par un désir de connaître ses pensées et ses sentiments, de découvrir ce qui le rend unique. Elle pourrait être patiente et douce dans ses tentatives pour le connaître mieux. 5. **La fille impatiente ou superficielle** : Elle pourrait ne pas trouver d\'intérêt pour le garçon timide, le percevant comme ennuyeux ou trop difficile à atteindre. Si elle privilégie les interactions sociales dynamiques et rapides, elle pourrait ne pas vouloir investir le temps nécessaire pour percer sa carapace. 6. **La fille empathique** : Compréhensive et sensible, elle pourrait percevoir la timidité du garçon comme une force plutôt qu\'une faiblesse, voyant derrière le voile de timidité une profondeur émotionnelle. Elle serait probablement patiente et ouverte, cherchant à établir une connexion authentique. 7. **La fille ambitieuse** : Si elle voit la timidité comme un obstacle à la réalisation de buts communs ou personnels, elle pourrait être frustrée ou même dédaigneuse envers la timidité du garçon. Cependant, si sa timidité ne l\'empêche pas de poursuivre ses propres objectifs, elle pourrait ne pas s\'en préoccuper outre mesure. 8. **La fille rêveuse** : Elle pourrait idéaliser le garçon timide, lui attribuant des qualités et des compétences qu\'il n\'a pas nécessairement. Pour elle, sa discrétion pourrait être vue comme un signe de profondeur et de richesse intérieure. Dans tous les cas, la perception de la timidité est subjective et peut être affectée par de nombreux facteurs, y compris les expériences personnelles, les valeurs et les attentes de chacune. Il est important de noter que ces stéréotypes ne couvrent pas la complexité complète des interactions humaines et que chaque individu est unique."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To bring a fresh twist, incorporate bold, contrasting colors and experiment with 3D effects that give an illusion of depth. Use these designs for a modern, edgy vibe that works particularly well on phone cases and tote bags. # 2. **Vibrant and Floral Prints** Floral prints never go out of style but evolve in their presentation. The key is to make them vibrant by using a wide palette of colors against darker backgrounds for a pop effect. Think tropical or exotic flowers that stand out for their uniqueness. They\'re perfect for female-oriented apparel and accessories, adding a touch of femininity and freshness. # 3. **Bold Typography** Bold, impactful typography with witty or motivational sayings can make a strong statement. Consider trendy typefaces or even custom lettering that matches the theme of your message. Neon colors on dark backgrounds or minimalist black-and-white designs can cater to different tastes. These designs are especially effective on t-shirts and sweatshirts, where the message can make a personal statement. # 4. **Quirky Illustrations** Illustrations provide a vast canvas for creativity – from whimsical characters to satirical cartoons. Leverage pop culture references, but add a unique twist to avoid clichés.

LearnDash está en constante actualización, y es posible que hayan añadido esta funcionalidad. 2. **Use LearnDash Drip-Feed Content**: Aunque no es exactamente una \\"fecha límite\\", LearnDash permite controlar cuándo se hace disponible el contenido utilizando la característica de Drip-Feed. Puedes configurarlo basado en días específicos después de la inscripción, lo cual puede funcionar de manera similar a una fecha límite si configuras todo el curso para ser secuencial. - Ve a la edición de tu lección en WordPress. - Busca la sección llamada \\"Settings\\" o \\"Configuraciones\\" de LearnDash. - Encuentra la opción de Drip-Feed. - Ajusta según tus necesidades, por ejemplo, hacer que la lección esté disponible después de cierto número de días tras la inscripción. 3. **Plugins de Terceros**: Si las opciones nativas de LearnDash no cumplen con tus requisitos, busca en el directorio de plugins de WordPress o en mercados de terceros. Existen plugins de restricción de contenido o de membresía como \\"Restrict Content Pro\\" o \\"MemberPress\\" que pueden ofrecer más control sobre el acceso al contenido y permitirte establecer una fecha límite. 4. **Personalización**: Si tienes habilidades de desarrollo o acceso a un desarrollador, puedes personalizar la funcionalidad mediante hooks y filtros disponibles en LearnDash. Esto podría implicar escribir un código personalizado que implemente una comprobación de la fecha para el acceso a la lección. 5. **Revisión de Elementor**: Aunque estás trabajando con Elementor, la configuración de la fecha límite se manejaría más a nivel de LearnDash o mediante un plugin adicional, y no directamente en Elementor. Sin embargo, asegúrate de que cualquier contenido o lección creada se muestre correctamente en tu sitio y que no haya conflictos entre Elementor y cualquier nuevo plugin que instales para gestionar las fechas límite. # Consideraciones - **Compatibilidad**: Asegúrate de que todos los plugins adicionales sean compatibles con tu versión actual de WordPress, LearnDash, y Elementor. - **Prueba**: Antes de implementar cualquier cambio en un sitio en vivo, prueba en un entorno de desarrollo o staging para asegurarte de que todo funciona como se espera. - **Backup**: Siempre es una buena práctica hacer un backup de tu sitio antes de instalar nuevos plugins o realizar cambios significativos. Al aplicar restricciones de tiempo, puedes mejorar el flujo de aprendizaje y motivar a tus estudiantes a completar los cursos dentro de un marco temporal específico."},{"prompt":"i had made a youtube shorts make catchy youtube shorts title (atleast 2 strong # in title), description (use atleast 10 strong # in description) and keywords (separated by comma in para form) to make it very strong contender of going viral on youtube and more strong on search engine and transcription of shorts is \\" We have two properties.

Spaces旨在让开发者能够分享和部署机器学习模型，其中大部分是以Gradio或者Streamlit界面展示模型的交互。 但你可以通过以下方式来适配你的目的： # 方案一：使用Gradio或Streamlit封装你的API 假设你的`kimi-free-api`提供了REST API服务，你可以用Gradio或Streamlit创建一个前端界面来调用这些API。以下是使用Gradio的一个基本例子： 1. **安装Gradio**: ```bash pip install gradio ``` 2. **创建一个Python脚本来调用你的API**: 假设你的API有一个名为`get_data`的端点，你可以这样做： ```python import requests import gradio as gr def fetch_data_from_api(input): # 假设你的API有一个叫做`get_data`的接口 url = f\\"http://localhost:8000/get_data?input={input}\\" response = requests.get(url) return response.text iface = gr.Interface(fn=fetch_data_from_api, inputs=\\"text\\", outputs=\\"text\\") iface.launch() ``` 3. **上传到Hugging Face Spaces**: - 你需要在[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)网站上创建一个账户并创建一个Space。 - 然后，通过Git将你的项目推送到你的Space仓库。 - 确保你的项目结构符合Hugging Face Spaces对Gradio或Streamlit应用的要求，并包含一个`requirements.txt`文件，以便自动安装所有依赖项。 请注意，你的API服务（在这个例子中是`kimi-free-api`）需要部署在能够被Gradio应用访问的地方。如果你打算将它部署在本地机器上，仅仅用于开发和测试，那么这种方法是可行的。但对于公共或生产环境，你需要将API部署到一个公共服务器或云服务上以确保Hugging Face Space可以访问它。 # 方案二：直接部署代码 如果你的API能够被简单的Python代码实现，并不需要依赖复杂的环境（即，可以依靠`requirements.txt`文件来安装所有依赖），你可以将整个实现直接上传到Hugging Face Spaces，而无需依赖Docker。 # 注意 由于Hugging Face Spaces的设计初衷是为了方便地部署和分享机器学习模型，因此在某些复杂的部署场景下（特别是那些需要特定系统环境配置的），你可能需要寻找其他服务（比如AWS、Google Cloud等）来部署你的Docker容器。然后，你可以利用Gradio或Streamlit与这些服务进行交互，再将这个交互界面部署到Hugging Face Spaces。"},{"prompt":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息: coupon_id:优惠券id，字符串类型，格式如:\\"2102024040378314\\" time:活动时间，字符串类型，格式如:\\"2024-4-1 ~ 2024-5-1

某活动中，每个用户每周可以享受1次优惠，但每月最多只能享受2次优惠。所以我们需要考虑到每个月的周数。 在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中
