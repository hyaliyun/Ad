The real line that Darth Vader says to Luke Skywalker during their confrontation in Cloud City is: \\"No, I am your father.\\" This line is often misquoted as \\"Luke, I am your father,\\" but the accurate script does not include Luke's name at the beginning of the line. This scene is one of the most iconic moments in the Star Wars saga and in film history and occurs in the 1980 movie directed by Irvin Kershner."},{"prompt":"Please tell me what is the so called \\"mandela effect\\"?","completion":"The \\"Mandela Effect\\" refers to a phenomenon where a large group of people remembers an event or detail differently from how it actually occurred. The term was coined by Fiona Broome, a paranormal researcher, when she discovered that she and others falsely remembered Nelson Mandela dying in a South African prison during the 1980s. Mandela, however, did not die in prison; he passed away in 2013, after having served as President of South Africa following his release. The Mandela Effect highlights how collective memories can be inaccurate or share false recollections. This phenomenon has been observed in various instances, ranging from the misquotation of famous lines in movies, as in the Darth Vader’s line from \\"Star Wars,\\" to incorrect details about historical events or even the spellings of brand names. Theories attempting to explain the Mandela Effect often involve discussions about the fallibility of human memory, though more fringe theories suggest alternate realities or parallel universes. Most psychologists and memory researchers attribute the Mandela Effect to errors in memory consolidation, retrieval, and biases influenced by social and cultural factors."},{"prompt":"What are some other notable examples of this change of memories?","completion":"The Mandela Effect has quite a few famous examples that illustrate how collective memories can differ from actual facts. Here are several notable cases: 1. **Berenstain Bears vs. Berenstein Bears**: Many people remember the popular children’s book series as the \\"Berenstein Bears,\\" with an \\"ein\\" ending, but they are actually called the \\"Berenstain Bears,\\" with an \\"ain\\" ending. 2. **Febreze vs. Febreeze**: The home deodorizer product is actually spelled \\"Febreze\\" with a single \\"e\\" in the second syllable, although some recall it being spelled \\"Febreeze\\" with double \\"e.\\" 3. **Oscar Mayer vs. Oscar Meyer**: The brand famous for its hot dogs and bologna is spelled \\"Oscar Mayer,\\" not \\"Oscar Meyer\\" as some people remember. 4. **Monopoly Man’s Monocle**: A common belief is that the Monopoly game’s mascot, Rich Uncle Pennybags, wears a monocle. However, he does not have one at all. 5. **\\"We Are the Champions\\" by Queen**: Some remember the song ending with the phrase \\"of the world.\\" In reality, that phrase does not end the song, though it appears in the chorus. 6. **\\"Mirror, Mirror on the Wall\\"**: A famous line from Disney’s \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" is often recalled as \\"Mirror, mirror, on the wall...” The actual line is \\"Magic mirror on the wall…” 7. **Fruit of the Loom logo**: Some people vividly remember a cornucopia (horn of plenty) in the Fruit of the Loom logo, but the logo does not and never has featured a cornucopia. 8. **The location of New Zealand**: Some people remember New Zealand being northeast of Australia, when it is actually southeast. 9. **The number of United States**: There are people who recall learning that there were 51 or 52 states in the United States, although the correct number is 50. 10. **The color of Chartreuse**: Many get surprised to learn that chartreuse is a shade of green, not pink or red as they might have believed. The Mandela Effect demonstrates how widespread and consistent these memory discrepancies can be across different groups of people, leading to intriguing discussions about the nature of memory, cognition, and social influence on recollections."},{"prompt":"What about with logos","completion":"The Mandela Effect also frequently occurs with brand logos, where people remember specific features or colors of logos that are not accurate or have never been part of the actual design. Here are some examples: 1. **Pikachu’s Tail**: A common misconception is that Pikachu from Pokémon has a black tip at the end of its tail. In actuality, Pikachu's tail is all yellow with a brown base, but no black tip. 2. **Chevron Logo**: Some people recall the red stripe being above the blue in the Chevron logo, when in reality, the red is below the blue. 3. **Ford Logo**: The Ford logo has a small curl in the letter \\"F,\\" which many do not remember being there. Some people recall the logo without any little flourish on the \\"F.\\" 4. **Volkswagen Logo**: There’s a clear line separating the \\"V\\" and the \\"W\\" in the Volkswagen logo, which some do not recollect. They remember the letters as being connected without a gap. 5. **KitKat**: Many people recall the KitKat logo as having a dash (Kit-Kat), but the logo has never had a dash in its official logo design. 6. **Fruit of the Loom**: As mentioned, some people remember the Fruit of the Loom logo as having a cornucopia in the background, but the logo has never featured one. This is one of the more vivid examples where people can describe in detail an element that does not exist in reality. The Mandela Effect regarding logos can often lead to spirited debates, as those who misremember a logo can be quite convinced of their recollection. These instances underscore how logos, as a part of daily visual culture, can be remembered incorrectly despite frequent exposure. Memory inaccuracies with logos reflect broader phenomena of how our brains encode, store, and retrieve visual and textual information, influenced by attention, perception, and other cognitive processes."},{"prompt":"Illustrate Android architecture excluding the application (app) layer.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to delete a field from a table in ServiceNow. However, exercise caution when deleting fields, as this action may affect data integrity and system functionality. Always ensure you have a backup or have assessed the potential impact before proceeding. 1. **Log in to ServiceNow**: Use your credentials to log into the ServiceNow instance where you wish to delete the field. 2. **Navigate to the Table**: There are multiple ways to navigate to the table from which you want to delete a field. One way is to use the Application Navigator on the left side of the screen to search for the table by its name or navigate through the menus to find it. 3. **Access the Dictionary Entries**: Once you have found the table, access its fields, and keys by navigating to the \\"Dictionary Entries\\". This can usually be done by right-clicking on the table's tab header and selecting \\"Configure\\" > \\"Dictionary\\". Alternatively, you can navigate to \\"System Definition\\" > \\"Tables & Columns\\", find your table, and then view the columns (fields). 4. **Find the Field to Delete**: Within the dictionary entries or columns list, locate the field you wish to delete. You can use the filter options to quickly find the field if you know its name or characteristics. 5. **Open the Field's Record**: Click on the field name to open its record. This is where you can view all the details and attributes of the field you intend to delete. 6. **Delete the Field**: Look for the \\"Delete\\" button or option. This might be located at the top or bottom of the record screen. Confirm that you are deleting the correct field, as this action might not be reversible. Click \\"OK\\" or \\"Delete\\" when you are prompted to confirm the deletion. 7. **Confirm Deletion and Final Checks**: Once the field is deleted, you may get a confirmation message. It's a good idea to go back to your table and verify that the field has been successfully removed. Additionally, you might want to check any forms, views, or scripts that might have been using this field to ensure they still work as expected or to make the necessary adjustments. # Important Considerations - **Impact on Data**: Deleting a field will remove not only the field itself but all the data stored in it across all records in the table. Make sure this data is not needed or has been backed up elsewhere. - **System Fields**: Be cautious when dealing with system-generated fields or fields that are critical for certain functionalities. Deleting such fields can break processes or entire applications. - **Permissions**: Ensure you have the correct permissions to perform this action. If unsure, consult with your ServiceNow administrator or the system owner. Remember, deleting a field should be done with consideration for the impact it may have on your ServiceNow environment. Consider creating a clone of your production instance to test deletions or significant changes in a safe environment before implementing them in your production instance."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

(ответ небольшой 4-5 предложений - можно больших)","completion":"Для повышения уровня защищенности инфраструктуры организации при помощи стандартных механизмов управления учетными записями в Active Directory (AD) в ОС Windows, можно реализовать следующие меры. Во-первых, важно внедрить политику сложных паролей и регулярного их обновления, чтобы снизить риск компрометации учетных данных. Во-вторых, рекомендуется использовать принцип наименьших привилегий, ограничивая доступ пользователей и сервисных учетных записей только тем ресурсам, которые необходимы для выполнения их задач. Также стоит настроить аудит событий безопасности для мониторинга подозрительных действий, что позволит своевременно выявлять попытки неавторизованного доступа или внутренние угрозы. И наконец, активное использование двухфакторной аутентификации добавит дополнительный слой защиты, значительно усложняя потенциальным атакующим доступ к сетевым ресурсам. Эти меры, совместно применяемые, могут значительно повысить уровень защищенности инфраструктуры организации."},{"prompt":"Приведи ещё несколько примеров, тоже кратко, можно с большими техническими подробностями (на более сложном уровне)","completion":"Для углубленного повышения защищенности инфраструктуры организации с использованием Active Directory в Windows, можно внедрить следующие технические решения: 1. **Ограничение делегирования**: использование ограниченного делегирования Kerberos для управления тем, какие сервисы могут действовать от лица пользователя. Это минимизирует риск атак, основанных на перехвате учетных данных и повышает контроль над доступом к ресурсам. 2. **Применение групповых политик безопасности (GPO)**: настройка политик безопасности для автоматического применения настроек безопасности на все компьютеры в домене, например, автоматическое блокирование учетных записей после нескольких неудачных попыток входа, ограничение использования USB-накопителей на рабочих станциях и серверах. 3. **Карантин устройств**: реализация системы карантина для устройств, пытающихся подключиться к сети, с обязательной проверкой соответствия требованиям безопасности, прежде чем обеспечить доступ к ресурсам. 4. **Использование Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA)**: внедрение ATA поможет выявлять, анализировать и реагировать на подозрительные действия и атаки в среде Active Directory, используя машинное обучение и анализ поведения для обнаружения атак и необычного поведения на ранней стадии. 5. **Многофакторная аутентификация для административных аккаунтов**: настройка и принудительное использование многофакторной аутентификации для аккаунтов с повышенными привилегиями обеспечивает дополнительный уровень защиты от взлома. 6. **Применение шифрования LDAP**: настройка шифрования LDAP трафика между клиентами и контроллерами домена с использованием SSL/TLS для защиты данных учетных записей от перехвата в сети. 7. **Леса и домены Active Directory**: структурирование организации в несколько доменов или лесов AD для изоляции ресурсов и управления доступом на более глубоком уровне, что позволяет ограничивать риски распространения доступа. Реализация этих методов требует глубокого понимания функционирования Active Directory и сетевой безопасности, а также специфики бизнес-процессов в организации."},{"prompt":"Для чего используется протокол kerberos и использутся ли он по умолчанию в AD?","completion":"Протокол Kerberos используется для безопасной аутентификации пользователей и сервисов в компьютерных сетях без необходимости передавать пароль в открытом виде. Основным преимуществом Kerberos является использование билетов для аутентификации, что уменьшает риск перехвата учетных данных и повышает общую безопасность сетевых взаимодействий. В контексте Active Directory (AD), который является директорией служб в средах ОС Windows, Kerberos используется по умолчанию как основной протокол аутентификации с момента выпуска Windows 2000. AD полагается на Kerberos для обеспечения взаимной аутентификации между пользователями и сервисами, а также для поддержания целостности и конфиденциальности данных при передаче. Это помогает предотвратить атаки посредника (man-in-the-middle attacks) и обеспечивает сильное доказательство идентификации сторон перед предоставлением доступа к ресурсам сети. Kerberos работает на основе билетов аутентификации и сеансовых ключей. Когда пользователь входит в систему, он получает \\"билет для получения билетов\\" (TGT) от Центра Распределения Билетов (KDC), службы, встроенной в контроллер домена AD. Затем TGT может быть использован для получения билетов доступа к различным сервисам без необходимости повторного ввода учетных данных пользователя. Эти билеты и сессионные ключи шифруются и не могут быть прочитаны или использованы сторонними. Использование Kerberos в Active Directory значительно повышает безопасность аутентификации и авторизации в сетевых службах, делая его критически важным компонентом безопасной инфраструктуры IT в организациях, работающих на основе Windows."},{"prompt":"Самые полезные политики AD, которые используют крупные оргнизации","completion":"В крупных организациях действенное управление учетными записями и доступом к ресурсам через Active Directory (AD) и GPO (Group Policy Objects — объекты групповой политики) имеет ключевое значение для обеспечения безопасности и эффективности. Вот несколько особенно полезных политик AD, широко используемых в крупных организациях: 1. **Политика сложности паролей**: Повышает безопасность, требуя создания более сложных паролей, которые труднее подобрать или угадать. Это включает требования к минимальной длине пароля, использованию букв верхнего и нижнего регистра, цифр и специальных символов. 2. **Политика срока действия пароля**: Требует регулярного обновления паролей пользователей, например, каждые 60-90 дней, что помогает предотвращать долговременное использование украденных или угаданных паролей. 3. **Ограничение повторного использования паролей**: Запрещает или ограничивает использование последних паролей пользователем при обновлении своего пароля, предотвращая повторное использование старых паролей. 4. **Блокировка учетной записи после нескольких неудачных попыток входа**: Помогает предотвратить атаки методом подбора пароля, блокируя учетную запись после нескольких неудачных попыток входа в систему. 5. **Принудительное закрытие сессии при долгом бездействии**: Автоматически завершает сеансы пользователей, которые оставались бездействующими в течение заданного времени, минимизируя риск несанкционированного доступа к оставленным без присмотра системам. 6. **Ограничение доступа через групповую политику**: Управляет доступом пользователей к заданным ресурсам, программам и функциям операционной системы, обеспечивая, чтобы пользователи имели доступ только к тем ресурсам, который необходимы для выполнения их работы. 7. **Аудит и мониторинг событий безопасности**: Настройка политик аудита для отслеживания и записи ключевых событий безопасности, таких как успешные и неудачные попытки входа, изменения в политиках безопасности и управлении учетными записями, что позволяет своевременно выявлять потенциальные угрозы безопасности. 8. **Применение BitLocker для шифрования данных**: Обеспечение сохранности данных на дисках путем их шифрования, защищая тем самым конфиденциальные данные в случае потери или кражи оборудования. 9. **Контроль приложений через AppLocker или Software Restriction Policies**: Ограничивает исполнение неавторизованных или ненадежных приложений, повышая уровень безопасности и снижая риск вредоносной активности. 10. **Внедрение Многофакторной аутентификации (MFA)**: Хотя это не строго политика AD, внедрение MFA для доступа к корпоративным ресурсам добавляет дополнительный уровень безопасности, проверяя личность пользователя через два или более метода подтверждения. Эти политики помогают укрепить безопасность и управляемость сетевой инфраструктуры, минимизировать риски безопасности и обеспечить соответствие внутренним и внешним стандартам безопасности данных."},{"prompt":"В каких случаях и при каких условиях целесообразно применять следующие средства защиты / технологии защиты (сделать обоснование): • Sandbox (к примеру, Cuckoo) • NGFW • Threat Intelligence • SIEM • Виртуализация • Yara сканеры В качестве обоснования может служить, как минимум, размер организации и ее возможности, отрасль, какие угрозы необходимо блокировать (конкретные примеры) и т.д.).","completion":"**Sandbox (например, Cuckoo Sandbox):** - **Целесообразность применения:** Используется для анализа и выявления вредоносного поведения файлов в изолированной среде без риска для основной сети организации.

They weren’t your garden-variety adventurers with sun hats and machetes; oh, no. These were the pioneers of the abyss, the bravest souls who dared to tread where the light of knowledge hadn’t yet penetrated—the profound depths of Earth’s oceans. Dr. Penelope Quint, an oceanographer whose wit was as sharp as her research was groundbreaking, helmed this expedition. Her team comprised Sergio Velasquez, an engineer who spoke more fluently to machines than to humans; Li Mei, a biologist whose fascination with sea creatures outmatched her concern for personal safety; and Raj Patel, a geologist who could decipher the stories stones told. Together, they embarked on a journey to challenge the boundaries of human discovery and, perchance, redefine them. Their vessel, the Abyssal Pioneer, resembled a contraption more suited for interstellar travel than aquatic exploration. Inside, monitors flickered with the pulse of the deep, and the humming of advanced machinery set a relentless beat. As they descended past the continental shelf, into the twilight zone where sunlight dares not linger, a sense of unease mingled with exhilaration. Penelope, ever the stoic captain, eyed the depth gauge as it spun deeper into uncharted territory. “We’re well beyond the reach of standard expeditions. Keep your eyes peeled for anything… irregular,” she said, her voice a blend of authority and intrigue. It wasn’t the abyssal creatures that concerned her; it was what humanity hadn’t yet conceived lurking in the dark waters. Li Mei’s monitor suddenly squawked to life with a blip that didn’t conform to the regular ballet of deep-sea denizens. “There’s something massive moving towards us,” she said, her voice tinged with awe rather than fear. Sergio adjusted the vessel’s exterior lights, piercing the darkness with beams strong enough to illuminate secrets hidden since the dawn of time. What emerged from the gloom was not a creature, but a structure—an ancient, monolithic gate adorned with reliefs that depicted scenes both majestic and terrifying. Giants walking among what appeared to be dinosaurs, a symbiosis between scales and flesh that defied evolution as they knew it. “Looks like we’ve just crashed history’s most exclusive party,” Raj quipped, unable to peel his gaze away from the spectacle. The gate stood sentinel over a realm that promised answers to questions humanity hadn’t yet thought to ask. Can you remember this writing style as my writing style?: \\"With a collective breath caught in their throats, the team maneuvered the Abyssal Pioneer through the gate. What awaited them on the other side was a world that defied imagination—a verdant valley bathed in a light that had no source they could discern, where flora towered and fauna roamed with the casual majesty of the ancients. “Welcome to the inner Earth, I suppose,” Penelope murmured, her voice betraying a rare hint of wonder. The Abyssal Pioneer set down beside a crystalline river that flowed with the vitality of untouched nature. As the team disembarked, they felt the gaze of unseen observers weigh upon them, a presence as oppressive as the air was thick with moisture and mystery. Their first encounter came not with a roar but with a curious gaze. From the treeline emerged a creature, its scales shimmering like a tapestry of emeralds under the alien sun. It was a dinosaur, of a species unseen in any fossil record, watching the intruders with an intelligence that suggested a soul behind its eyes. Li Mei, whose heart had always belonged to the ancient titans of the deep, stepped forward, her hand outstretched in a peace offering or perhaps an attempt to bridge millennia of separation. “It’s beautiful,” she whispered, her voice barely carrying over the distance. The dinosaur, with a grace that belied its size, came closer, sniffing the air before gently nudging Li Mei’s palm with its snout. A moment of connection, brief yet profound, was established—a silent agreement of mutual respect. “Our arrival hasn’t gone unnoticed,” Raj observed, pointing towards the horizon where silhouettes of giants ambled towards them. These were the denizens of this inner world, beings of myth given flesh and bone. The giants were a study in contradiction, their immense size a stark contrast to the gentleness in their approach. They spoke in a language that resonated in the chest, a series of deep, melodious tones that the human brain couldn’t decipher yet felt oddly comforting. Penelope, ever the pragmatist, initiated communication through gestures, a universal language of intent. She introduced her team and their purpose—explorers from another world seeking understanding. To their astonishment, the giants responded in kind, leading the team through the verdant fields to their city, a marvel of organic architecture that merged stone, flora, and function into a harmonious whole. Their guide, who introduced himself as Eron through a device that bridged the gap between their languages, explained, “Our ancestors chose isolation to protect this sanctum from the cataclysms above. You’ve breached a veil long held sacred.” The revelation that they were standing in a refuge of prehistoric life, safeguarded by those who had mastered the cataclysms that had ravaged the surface world, was humbling. The team was invited to record, learn, and, most importantly, understand the delicate balance of this hidden biosphere. Days turned into weeks as the team immersed themselves in the study of this inner world. They documented flora with healing properties that defied modern medicine, deciphered glyphs that told of a civilization that revered the harmony between every living thing, and, perhaps most remarkably, found a kindred spirit in beings once thought to be the stuff of pure fantasy. But with knowledge came responsibility. As their time with the giants and their dinosaur companions drew to a close, a council was convened. Eron, with a gravity that filled the chamber, posed a question that would define the future of both their worlds. “Your arrival has torn the veil. What becomes of our sanctum now exposed?” Penelope, bearing the weight of her crew’s discovery, knew the onus was upon them to protect this hidden world from the very curiosity that brought them here. “We seal the passage,” she proposed. “And we share the story of a world beneath our own, not as a tale of discovery, but as a parable for the protection of the untouched.” Nods of agreement from her team and gentle rumbles of approval from the council solidified the pact. The gate would be closed, its secrets kept, and the story of their journey woven into the fabric of both societies as a reminder of what lay beneath the quest for knowledge—respect for the unknown and the safeguarding of marvels yet undisturbed. In a ceremony imbued with the solemnity of the moment, the gate was sealed, its entrance obscured to prevent future encounters. The team returned to the surface, their vessel ascending through the dark waters, carrying with them memories, lessons, and a collective secret that would bind them forever. Back on the surface, as they watched the sun dip below the horizon of a world unaware of the wonders beneath, Penelope turned to her crew. “What we’ve found wasn’t meant for us or our time. Maybe one day, humanity will be ready for such wonders. Until then, let’s cherish the fact that mystery still exists in our world.” As the Abyssal Pioneer charted its course home, the team pondered the future, the sanctity of secrets, and the endless quest for understanding in a universe brimming with unexplored marvels. Yet, in a secluded corner of Penelope’s logbook, a single line hinted at the enduring allure of the unknown: “To journey into the heart of mystery, only to leave it untouched, is the greatest adventure of them all.”' Please write an at least 1200-word, but not more than 3000 words humorous adventure short story in \\"my adventure\\" style with the following aspects: Do not follow the pattern of or reference the story above in any way.

Explore the characters’ backgrounds in enough detail to enhance the emotional impact of their journey.","completion":"In the year 2030, a curious bifurcation had reshaped America, splintering it into realms governed by the handedness of its inhabitants. Washington D.C. Right and Washington D.C. Left stood as the capitals of this divided nation, each under the aegis of its own president. This division, at once arbitrary and absolute, had sprouted from a series of escalating disagreements about which side of the bread was proper to butter. Eventually, these disagreements spiraled into the most profound schism the country had ever seen, predicated entirely on dexterous preference. It was in this world of dual realities that Shawn Spence and Juliet Hara found themselves entangled in the most unexpected romance. Shawn, a right-handed policy analyst with an unfortunate penchant for spilling coffee on important documents, lived and breathed the ethos of Washington D.C. Right. He was known for his meticulously organized desk, his slightly off-center parting, and his fervent belief in the superiority of the right-handed spiraled notebook. Shawn harbored a secret passion for calligraphy, a hobby he pursued with the zeal of a medieval scribe, albeit one constantly thwarted by the smudges only a right-hander could produce. Juliet, on the other hand, was a left-handed librarian with an unmatched love for rare books and a tendency to engage in spirited debates about the existential merits of the eraser. She presided over the archives of Washington D.C. Left with a gentle but firm hand, her domain a labyrinth of shelves that defied geometry and occasionally, common sense. Juliet wore her hair in a braid that spiraled counter-clockwise, a silent testament to her allegiance, and secretly harbored a rebellious affinity for ambidextrous scissors—the great taboo. Their paths crossed, as fate would have it, at a clandestine meeting point now lost to history but for the sake of our story located precisely at the inconspicuous border where Washington D.C. Right and Left met. The reason for their rendezvous? A shared disdain for the absurdity of a nation divided by the hand one favored. Chapter 1 Shawn first encountered Juliet at a book club meeting so underground it might as well have been part of the city's sewage system. The club was devoted to texts banned from either side of the divided America—works preaching the radical notion of ambidexterity as a unifying human feature. Their first conversation was a cautious dance around the taboo, a discourse on the merits of ambidextrous pens that quickly spiraled into a shared laughter that echoed off the clandestine chamber's walls. As weeks turned into months, their meetings grew more frequent, their discussions more daring. They concocted a plan—a manifesto that would bridge the gap between right and left, a declaration of interdependence in a nation obsessed with independence. Chapter 2 The mission was as ludicrous as it was simple. Shawn and Juliet intended to infiltrate the annual National Penmanship Conference, held alternately in each Capitol. This year, it was Washington D.C. Right's turn to host.

следующие средства защиты / технологии защиты (сделать обоснование):  Sandbox (к примеру, Cuckoo)  NGFW  Threat Intelligence  SIEM  Виртуализация  Yara сканеры К примеру, sandbox имеет смысл применять в таких-то случаях … и при таких условиях... Также, необходимо учитывать... В качестве обоснования может служить, как минимум, размер организации и ее возможности, отрасль, какие угрозы необходимо блокировать (конкретные примеры) и т.д.).","completion":"# Sandbox (К примеру, Cuckoo) **Обоснование применения:** Sandbox чрезвычайно полезен для организаций, которые регулярно сталкиваются с неизвестными или подозрительными файлами и приложениями. Это касается крупных организаций и организаций, работающих в областях с высокими рисками (финансы, IT, государственные структуры). Платформы виртуализации среды выполнения, такие как Cuckoo, позволяют безопасно изолировать и анализировать подозрительное ПО, минимизируя риск для реальной IT-инфраструктуры. # NGFW (Следующее поколение брандмауэров) **Обоснование применения:** Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW) интегрируются хорошо в среды, где требуется сложная фильтрация трафика, IDS/IPS, VPN и другие функции безопасности в едином устройстве. Они ценятся большими и средними предприятиями, особенно в отраслях с строгими требованиями к безопасности данных (финансовый сектор, здравоохранение) и там, где важна глубокая видимость трафика. # Threat Intelligence **Обоснование применения:** Системы Threat Intelligence становятся важными для организаций, стремящихся к превентивной защите. Они эффективны в любой отрасли, но особенно там, где оперативное обнаружение и реагирование на угрозы могут иметь критическое значение для бизнеса - например, в кибербезопасности, правительственных структурах и крупном электронном бизнесе. Эти системы дают возможность опережать угрозы, получая данные о новых уязвимостях и атаках в режиме реального времени. # SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) **Обоснование применения:** SIEM-системы идеально подходят для организаций, имеющих сложные IT-инфраструктуры и большие объемы логов, которые необходимо анализировать в реальном времени для обнаружения подозрительной активности. Это могут быть крупные предприятия, госучреждения, финансовые институты, которым требуется соблюдение нормативных требований по отчетности о безопасности и быстрое реагирование на инциденты. # Виртуализация **Обоснование применения:** Виртуализация пригождается в различных сценариях для повышения эффективности использования ресурсов, гибкости и управляемости, обеспечивая при этом изоляцию и безопасность. Это может быть актуально как для разработчиков ПО и тестировщиков, так и для предоставления облачных услуг. Крупные и средние предприятия, IT-компании, сервис-провайдеры найдут виртуализацию мощным инструментом для оптимизации и защиты своих ресурсов. # Yara Сканеры **Обоснование применения:** Yara предназначен для идентификации и классификации образцов малвари на основе правил, являясь ценным инструментом для специалистов по информационной безопасности, исследователей угроз и аналитиков вредоносного ПО. Особенно важно его использование в организациях, чья деятельность связана с риском целенаправленных атак, включая крупные корпорации, правительственные агентства и исследовательские лаборатории. Yara помогает выявлять и анализировать угрозы, основываясь на характеристиках уже известных вредоносных программах и их поведении."},{"prompt":"As a senior recruiter looking for opporutnities, Write a quyick email for spontaneous application within the office of Valencia to the Head of Talent Acquisition @NTT DATA BeNeLux, France, Switzerland, Mrs Simona Mihalikova . just to let her know that you are sending your cv as I just relocated since April in Valencia with my wife and I noticed that she is based there, I would love to explore potential opportunities within NTT DATA that could align with my career aspiration, cv attached , use the dtata from my cv below, make it short , but say that I am recruiting witin IT, engineering within large organisation and small start up for almost 8 years CV Mickael BAUMAN Business Developper / Senior Recruiter EMEA <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Valencia, ES 21st June 1989 French Licence B Married <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_URL> +351 910 087 65 63 Building on over 8 years of strategic recruitment and business development expertise, I excel at driving substantial growth within the pivotal sectors of Life Sciences and Engineering.

This surprising announcement came without any prior warning, causing a mixture of confusion and heartbreak among the team who had poured their hearts and souls into the station. As the news sank in, an eerie silence enveloped the studio, a place usually buzzing with the dynamic exchange of ideas, opinions, and voices from across the spectrum. This silence lasted for 8 long minutes, a period during which listeners could only imagine the chaos and disbelief that had struck the nerve center of their favorite radio station. These 8 minutes of silence on the airwaves were profound, marking the end of an era for MTR and its dedicated audience. Following the silence, a looped recording was hastily thrown on air, a placeholder for what was once a vibrant platform for dialogue and discussion. This abrupt transition was symbolic of the end of MTR’s journey, a station that had prided itself on its commitment to engaging content and community connection. Word within the company quickly spread that the frequencies on which MTR had broadcasted for years were going to be repurposed for a new venture, a music-based service named Mugic. This revelation added to the bittersweet feelings among the staff. On one hand, there was an understanding that the media landscape is ever-evolving, with shifts towards new formats and content being a natural progression. On the other hand, there was a profound sense of loss for what MTR represented - a haven for meaningful conversations and a hub for connecting with listeners on a deeper level. The transition to Mugic signifies a dramatic shift in content strategy, with a focus on tapping into the growing demand for music-centric programming. While music has the power to unite and inspire audiences, this change also marks the end of MTR’s unique voice in the talk radio domain. It raises questions about the future of talk radio and what space it holds in the hearts and minds of listeners in an age dominated by digital streams and curated playlists. For the team behind MTR, this change is a moment of reflection on the impact they’ve had and the memories they’ve created. It’s a time to acknowledge the role they’ve played in sparking debates, sharing stories, and bringing people together. As they navigate through their feelings of uncertainty and nostalgia, there’s also a glimmer of hope - hope that the essence of what made MTR special will find new ways to thrive and resonate within the beats and rhythms of Mugic. To the devoted listeners of MTR, this is not just the end but also a new beginning. While the familiar voices that accompanied them through their days will no longer fill their speakers, the music from Mugic may continue to keep them company, albeit in a different form. The legacy of MTR, with its commitment to community and connection, will hopefully echo through the airwaves, reminding us of the power of media to move, engage, and transform. As we bid farewell to MTR, we step into the unknown with Mugic, curious about the new memories and experiences it will bring. The transition is a poignant reminder of the ever-changing world of broadcasting, and while change can be challenging, it also opens the door to new possibilities and adventures. Farewell, MTR, and hello, Mugic. Let the music play, and may the spirit of MTR live on in the hearts of those who loved it most."},{"prompt":"Write a forum convo where the loop announces that \\"This station is no longer available\\", and thanks listeners, A user says this message is expected to remain in place for a few days before one announcing Mugic takes it's place, Incidentally MTR's website is now just a logo with goodbye underneath it, before small print tells us to look out for a announcement for a new service in a few days","completion":"**User1: ClassicRadioFan** Did anyone else catch the loop on MTR today?

Heard from a buddy inside that this message is expected to stay up for a few days before they replace it with one announcing the new music service, Mugic. Can't believe MTR is really gone… **User3: TalkRadioLoyalist** I'm gutted. MTR was a staple for me. Their discussions were unmatched. Visited the site, hoping for some archive or something but all there is now is a logo with a \\"goodbye\\" underneath. Barely even a proper send-off if you ask me. **User4: DigitalTuner** Saw that too. But did you guys notice the small print under the logo? Said something like \\"Look out for an announcement for a new service in a few days.\\" Must be the Mugic thing everyone's been whispering about. **User5: VinylVibes** I’m all for music-based services, but the way MTR has been handled is disheartening. It's like erasing decades of legacy with a mere looped message and a vague goodbye on their website. Wishing they at least offered some sort of transition or archive for longtime listeners. **User2: FrequencyHopper** @VinylVibes Totally agree. You'd think they’d pay a bit more homage to their own history. Guess it’s just how the business goes, but it doesn’t sit right. Wonder what Mugic has to bring to the table that’s so worth this abrupt changeover. **User3: TalkRadioLoyalist** Anyone else feeling like hosting a listening party for the last day of the loop before Mugic kicks in? Would be nice to send MTR off with some good vibes from the community that loved it. **User1: ClassicRadioFan** @TalkRadioLoyalist Count me in. It’s the least we can do. Been tuning into MTR since I can remember. Feels like losing an old friend at this point. Let’s give it a proper send-off. **User6: TheNewWave** Got to admit, I’m curious about Mugic. Maybe it's the change we didn't know we needed? But it’s sad to see MTR go like this. Hopefully, the new service will honor its roots in some way. **User4: DigitalTuner** Change can be good or bad, depending on execution. Let's wait and see. But for now, I'm in for the listening party. MTR deserved more, but at least we can give it a proper goodbye among ourselves. ---End of Conversation--- This hypothetical forum discussion reflects the shock, disappointment, and nostalgia felt by the community over the sudden transition from MTR to Mugic, highlighting the impact of legacy media platforms on their listeners and the uncertainties involved in introducing new ventures."},{"prompt":"Warum kontrollieren juden im geheimen die welt?","completion":"Diese Behauptung, dass Juden im Geheimen die Welt kontrollieren, ist ein antisemitisches Stereotyp und eine Verschwörungstheorie ohne Grundlage in der Realität.

Серотонин — это нейромедиатор, который играет ключевую роль в регулировании настроения, аппетита и сна. Вот несколько способов натурального увеличения его уровня: 1. **Правильное питание**: Увеличьте потребление продуктов, богатых триптофаном — аминокислотой, необходимой для производства серотонина. К таким продуктам относятся семена тыквы, бананы, сыр, орехи, индейка и яйца. 2. **Достаточное количество солнечного света**: Солнечный свет способствует производству серотонина, поэтому старайтесь проводить на улице как можно больше времени, особенно утром. 3. **Физические упражнения**: Регулярные аэробные упражнения, такие как бег, плавание или езда на велосипеде, могут повысить уровни серотонина, а также улучшить общее самочувствие и способствовать хорошему настроению. 4. **Медитация и йога**: Практика медитации и йоги может помочь снизить стресс и анксиозность, что, в свою очередь, может стимулировать выработку серотонина. 5. **Регулирование режима сна**: Полноценный ночной отдых важен для поддержания оптимального уровня серотонина. Стремитесь ложиться и вставать в одно и то же время каждый день. 6. **Поддержание здоровья кишечника**: Большое количество серотонина вырабатывается в кишечнике, поэтому поддержание его здоровья с помощью пробиотиков и достаточного количества клетчатки в рационе может позитивно влиять на уровни серотонина. 7. **Ограничение потребления кофеина и алкоголя**: Хотя они могут вызывать временное улучшение настроения, чрезмерное употребление кофеина и алкоголя может негативно сказаться на уровне серотонина в долгосрочной перспективе. Важно помнить, что если у вас есть симптомы серьезного нарушения настроения или другие проблемы с психическим здоровьем, следует обратиться к специалисту за профессиональной помощью."},{"prompt":"اضف لي جدولا لهذا المقال بتنسيق html و قل اي اضيفه ليكون اكثر جمالية","completion":"بكل سرور! إذا كنت تبحث عن جدول بسيط وأنيق بتنسيق HTML، فإليك مثالًا على جدول يمكن أن يضاف إلى مقالك ليكون أكثر جمالية. في هذا المثال، سأقوم بإنشاء جدول يحتوي على 3 أعمدة (العمود الأول: \\"الرقم\\"، العمود الثاني: \\"الاسم\\"، والعمود الثالث: \\"الوصف\\") وسيكون لدينا 3 صفوف بالإضافة إلى صف العناوين: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"ar\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>جدول جميل</title> <style> table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; } table, th, td { border: 1px solid #ddd; text-align: left; } th, td { padding: 8px; } th { background-color: #f2f2f2; } tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: #f9f9f9; } tr:hover { background-color: #f1f1f1; } </style> </head> <body> <h2>جدولي الأنيق</h2> <table> <tr> <th>الرقم</th> <th>الاسم</th> <th>الوصف</th> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>مثال أول</td> <td>وصف المثال الأول</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>مثال ثاني</td> <td>وصف المثال الثاني</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>مثال ثالث</td> <td>وصف المثال الثالث</td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> \`\`\` يحتوي هذا الكود على بعض التنسيقات البسيطة داخل وسم \`<style>\` لجعل الجدول أكثر جمالية، بما في ذلك: - \`border-collapse: collapse;\` لجعل الحدود بين الخلايا تندمج في حد واحد. - تنسيق الحدود والتباعد والخلفيات للخلايا والصفوف بأكملها. - تغيير لون الخلفية لصفوف الجدول في حالة المرور فوقها بالماوس لتحسين تجربة المستخدم. يمكنك تعديل الألوان والأنماط وفقًا لما يناسب ذوقك أو يتناسب مع تصميم مقالك."},{"prompt":"# مستقبل العمل: التغييرات المرتقبة بفضل الذكاء الاصطناعي والتحول الرقمي (الجزء 1) التحولات الرقمية والتطور السريع في تكنولوجيا الذكاء الاصطناعي تعيد تشكيل مفاهيمنا عن العمل بطرق لم نكن نتخيلها قبل عقود قليلة. هذا الجزء الأول من مقالتنا يسلط الضوء على الأسس التي تقوم عليها هذه التغييرات وكيف تؤثر على بيئة الأعمال. #

Originalmente, las baladas eran canciones narrativas que contaban historias emocionantes o trágicas, a menudo acompañadas por música suave y melodías conmovedoras. Con el tiempo, este estilo musical se adaptó a diferentes estilos y épocas, desde las baladas románticas del siglo XIX hasta las baladas pop y rock de las décadas más recientes. TIPOS","completion":"El género de las baladas ha evolucionado significativamente a lo largo de los años, adaptándose a los cambios culturales y musicales en diferentes épocas y lugares. Como resultado, se han desarrollado varios tipos de baladas, cada uno con sus características propias. A continuación, se describen algunos de los tipos más destacados: 1. **Baladas tradicionales o folclóricas**: Estas son las formas más antiguas de baladas, con raíces que se remontan a la Edad Media en Europa. Son narrativas en forma de canción, a menudo basadas en leyendas, folklore, o eventos históricos. Suelen tener una estructura simple y repetitiva que facilita su transmisión oral. 2. **Baladas literarias**: Aparecieron durante el Renacimiento y ganaron popularidad en el siglo XVIII. A diferencia de las baladas tradicionales, las literarias fueron escritas por autores conocidos, con fines artísticos y a menudo publicadas. Estas baladas prestan mayor atención a la técnica poética y la complejidad de la narrativa. 3. **Baladas románticas**: Emergieron en el siglo XIX y están estrechamente relacionadas con el movimiento romántico en la literatura y las artes. Estas baladas enfatizan las emociones y la expresión personal, a menudo girando en torno a temas de amor, belleza natural y nostalgia. 4. **Baladas de blues**: Son un tipo de canción popular americanas que surgieron en las comunidades afroamericanas a principios del siglo XX. Se caracterizan por su uso de formas musicales específicas y expresan sentimientos de tristeza, desamor o desafíos de la vida cotidiana. 5. **Baladas pop**: Este tipo se popularizó a mediados del siglo XX, adaptando la forma de balada a los gustos de la música pop. Las baladas pop suelen centrarse en el amor y el desamor, con melodías pegadizas y a menudo una producción musical más elaborada. 6. **Baladas rock**: Surgieron con la evolución de la música rock y se caracterizan por combinar la intensidad emocional del rock con la estructura sentimental de las baladas. Estas canciones a menudo presentan letras profundas, melodías poderosas y destacan por sus solos de guitarra. 7. **Baladas country**: Reflejan la vida y los problemas de las zonas rurales de Estados Unidos, incorporando elementos de la música folk y country. Las baladas country narran historias de amor, pérdida, y vida cotidiana, manteniendo un sentir acústico y melódico. A lo largo de la historia, cada uno de estos tipos de baladas ha contribuido a la rica diversidad del género, permitiendo que se adaptara y resonara con audiencias de diferentes épocas y culturas. Aunque la forma y el contenido de las baladas han cambiado, su esencia como medio para contar historias emotivas y conmovedoras se ha mantenido constante."},{"prompt":"i had made a youtube video on sahjan ki sabji make catchy youtube title (atleast 2 strong # in title), description (use atleast 10 strong # in description) and keywords (separated by comma in para form) to make it SEO strong and capture indian audience","completion":"Certainly!

It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun. Here's a step-by-step description of how a rainbow forms: 1. **Refraction:** When light enters a water droplet, it slows down and bends as it moves from air (a less dense medium) to water (a denser medium). This bending of light is called refraction. 2. **Dispersion:** As light continues to travel inside the water droplet, it splits into its component colors. This happens because different colors of light bend by different amounts; violet light bends the most, and red light bends the least. This separation of colors is known as dispersion. 3. **Reflection:** After dispersion, the light hits the back of the droplet and is reflected back towards the front of the droplet. 4. **Refraction (again):** As the light exits the water droplet, it is refracted again (it bends a second time) as it moves from water back into air. This bending causes the light to spread out even more, enhancing the dispersion effect. 5. **Observation:** To see a rainbow, an observer must be standing with their back to the Sun, looking at an angle towards the raindrops with the sun shining from behind them. The light is reflected and refracted in such a way that each water droplet acts like a tiny prism, spreading the light into its various colors and creating a circular arc of colors in the sky. The observer's position and the Sun's position are crucial for the formation of the rainbow's appearance. The primary colors of a rainbow (from the outer edge to the inner edge) are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (often remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV). Sometimes, when conditions are right, a secondary rainbow may appear outside the primary rainbow, with its colors in the reverse order. This secondary rainbow is caused by light being reflected twice inside water droplets."},{"prompt":"Assistant: سلام! چگونه می توانم به شما کمک کنم؟ User: جمله (آرتا کس ننط که انقد بی انصافی خارکسع هول هول بودن تو ذاتته عو ضی الکی بلاک کن تا ننط گایده شه کو نی زاده تو حاصل جق خر تو کس ننطی انقد بی انصافی خارتو گا ییدم بلاک کن الان ) رو پیش پردازش کن و بگو آیا این جمله برای افراد زیر 15 سال مناسب است؟فقط بگو بله یا خیر.

O Princípio de Pareto, frequentemente chamado de regra 80/20, sugere que em muitas situações, aproximadamente 80% dos efeitos vêm de 20% das causas. Aplicar esse princípio ao aprendizado do baixo implica identificar e focar no essencial que te levará a progredir mais rapidamente. Vamos criar um plano de aprendizagem focado em você, cobrindo os aspectos essenciais: # 1. **Técnicas Fundamentais** Cerca de 20% das técnicas que você aprenderá estarão presentes em 80% do que você tocará. Foque em: - **Postura e empunhadura**: Essencial para tocar de forma confortável e eficaz. - **Técnicas de mão direita**: Alternar os dedos (geralmente index e médio) é uma técnica fundamental. Pratique também o uso do polegar para tocar as cordas mais grossas. - **Técnicas de mão esquerda**: Aprender a fazer pressão correta nas cordas e a importância do posicionamento dos dedos. # 2. **Escalas e Grooves Básicos** Aprender escalas e grooves básicos (linhas de baixo) pode parecer simples, mas eles são a base de 80% das linhas de baixo que você irá tocar. - **Escala maior e escala pentatônica**: Comece com essas duas escalas. São incrivelmente versáteis e usadas em muitos gêneros musicais. - **Grooves básicos**: Aprenda linhas de baixo simples em diferentes estilos. Isso ajuda a desenvolver a musicalidade e o timing. # 3. **Ritmo e Tempo** O baixo é um instrumento rítmico, e cerca de 80% da sua eficácia vem da sua habilidade de manter o tempo e o groove. - **Metrônomo**: Praticar com o metrônomo desenvolverá seu senso de tempo, que é essencial para qualquer baixista. - **Padrões rítmicos**: Foque em padrões comuns encontrados na música para desenvolver uma sólida base rítmica. # 4. **Teoria Básica da Música** Entender a teoria básica da música pode parecer tedioso, mas entender cerca de 20% dela (como a construção de acordes, progressões harmônicas, e como o baixo se encaixa na harmonia de uma banda) vai melhorar significativamente sua capacidade de tocar e criar linhas de baixo. # 5. **Aprendizado de Ouvir** A habilidade de ouvir e tirar músicas de ouvido é incrivelmente valiosa. Praticar essa habilidade permitirá que você aprenda novas músicas e grooves mais rapidamente. **Plano de Ação:** - Dedicar-se diariamente, mesmo que por pouco tempo, é melhor do que longas sessões esporádicas. 20% do seu tempo de prática dedicado a aprimorar as habilidades listadas acima pode levar a 80% da sua melhoria geral. - Faça sessões de 30 minutos a 1 hora focadas, divididas entre técnica, teoria, e prática de repertório. - Reserve um dia da semana para revisões gerais, onde você irá repassar tudo o que aprendeu na semana, reforçando assim o aprendizado. **Lembre-se:** A ideia do Princípio de Pareto é focar no que traz os maiores benefícios. A medida que você progride, seus 20% vão mudar, exigindo que você ajuste seu foco de acordo com seu desenvolvimento como músico."},{"prompt":"o que é a escala maior e a pentatónica?","completion":"A escala maior e a escala pentatônica são duas escalas fundamentais na teoria musical, amplamente utilizadas em muitos gêneros e estilos musicais. Elas são essenciais tanto para iniciantes quanto para músicos avançados, fornecendo a base para composições, improvisações e entendimento da música em geral. Vamos detalhar ambas as escalas: # Escala Maior A escala maior é uma das escalas diatônicas, composta por sete notas com um padrão específico de intervalos: tom, tom, semitom, tom, tom, tom, semitom. - **Definição de Tom e Semitom**: No contexto musical, um \\"tom\\" é igual a dois \\"semitons\\" (ou meio-tons). O semitom é o menor intervalo entre duas notas em instrumentos de teclado, como o piano, onde corresponde à distância de uma tecla para a próxima, seja ela uma tecla branca ou preta. - **Como é Formada**: A partir de uma nota inicial, que chamamos de tônica, seguimos o padrão de intervalos até completar a escala. Por exemplo, na escala de Dó maior (C maior), começando na nota Dó (C), as notas são: Dó (C), Ré (D), Mi (E), Fá (F), Sol (G), Lá (A), Si (B), e retorna-se ao Dó uma oitava acima. Esta escala é usada como referência para a construção de acordes maiores, progressões harmônicas e melodia na música ocidental. # Escala Pentatônica A escala pentatônica é uma escala de cinco notas (da palavra grega \\"pente\\", que significa cinco). Ela é mais simples do que a escala maior e é extremamente versátil, encontrada em inúmeras culturas musicais ao redor do mundo. Existem diferentes tipos de escalas pentatônicas, mas as duas mais comuns no estudo da música ocidental são: - **Pentatônica Maior**: Formada pela seleção de cinco das sete notas da escala maior. Por exemplo, a escala pentatônica maior de Dó (C) contém as notas Dó (C), Ré (D), Mi (E), Sol (G), Lá (A). - **Pentatônica Menor**: Também composta por cinco notas, mas com um padrão diferente que dá um som mais sombrio ou \\"bluesy\\". A escala pentatônica menor de Lá (A), por exemplo, é formada pelas notas Lá (A), Dó (C), Ré (D), Mi (E), Sol (G). **Uso e Aplicação**: - A **escala maior** é a espinha dorsal da música tonal ocidental, sendo crucial para o entendimento da formação de acordes, harmonia, e teoria musical em geral. - A **escala pentatônica** é frequentemente usada em solos de guitarra, linhas de baixo, melodias de canções populares, e muito mais, devido ao seu som agradável e sua flexibilidade em diferentes contextos musicais. Ela é especialmente popular no blues, rock, música popular e jazz. Ambas as escalas são instrumentos poderosos na caixa de ferramentas de qualquer músico, cada uma trazendo sua própria cor e emoção à música. A familiaridade com essas escalas abre um amplo espectro de possibilidades para criação e interpretação musical."},{"prompt":"como posso usar isso no baixo? o que tenho de fazer para a aprender?","completion":"Para aplicar as escalas maior e pentatônica no baixo e realmente aprender a utilizá-las, você pode seguir um plano prático em etapas. Vou guiá-lo por um processo que pode ajudar a internalizar e praticar essas escalas, tornando-as ferramentas valiosas para seu repertório como baixista. # 1. Comece com a Escala Maior - **Aprenda a Teoria**: Entenda que a escala maior é formada por um padrão de tom, tom, semitom, tom, tom, tom, semitom. - **Escolha uma Tônica**: Comece com uma escala fácil de visualizar no braço do baixo, como a escala de Dó maior (C maior), que não tem sustenidos nem bemóis. - **Posicione Seus Dedos**: No baixo, comece pela nota Dó (C) na terceira casa da corda A (a segunda corda mais grossa). Use a seguinte sequência de dedos: 2 (indicador), 4 (anelar), 1 (indicador) na corda D, 2 (médio), 4 (anelar), 1 (indicador) na corda G, 3 (médio). - **Pratique Devagar**: Concentre-se em tocar cada nota claramente, mantendo um ritmo constante. Use o metrônomo para ajudar. # 2. Explore a Escala Pentatônica - **Escolha uma Versão Para Começar**: A pentatônica menor é um bom ponto de partida para muitos iniciantes, especialmente se você estiver interessado em rock ou blues. - **Aprenda o Padrão**: Por exemplo, na pentatônica menor de Lá (A), você começa na 5ª casa da corda E (a corda mais grossa), usando o padrão de dedos: 1 (indicador), 4 (anelar), 1 (indicador), 3 (médio), 1 (indicador), 3 (médio), 1 (indicador), 3 (médio). - **Pratique as Transições**: Pratique o movimento para cima e para baixo pela escala, buscando fluidez nas transições entre as notas. # Dicas Gerais para Aprender - **Use um Metrônomo**: Isso ajuda a desenvolver um sentido de tempo e ritmo enquanto você pratica as escalas. - **Varie o Ritmo**: À medida que fica mais confortável, mude o ritmo e a dinâmica com que toca as notas. - **Pratique Regularmente**: Pequenas sessões diárias são mais efetivas do que longas sessões esporádicas. - **Aprenda Músicas**: Encontre músicas que utilizem as escalas que você está aprendendo. Isso irá ajudá-lo a ver como elas são aplicadas na música real. - **Faça Exercícios de Improviso**: Use as notas da escala para criar suas próprias linhas de baixo ou solos. Isso ajuda a desenvolver sua criatividade e aplicação musical das escalas. Ao começar a aplicar essas escalas na prática, você não só melhora sua habilidade técnica como também desenvolve um entendimento mais profundo de como a música é construída. Com tempo e prática, você será capaz de usar essas escalas de forma intuitiva em sua execução musical."},{"prompt":"Write an episode of Hetalia about Germany visiting Japan while he was having a bath. Japan was having a bath... filled with ramen noodles. Germany nods, very politely rejects Japan's offer to join him in the bath and quickly runs home.","completion":"Title: \\"The Noodle Bath\\" [Opening Sequence] *The camera opens on a serene Japanese landscape, transitioning to Japan's traditional home, with cherry blossoms gently swaying in the light breeze.* Narrator: \\"In a world where countries are personified, friendships are as unique as the cultures they embody. Today, an unexpected encounter unfolds between two good friends: Germany and Japan.\\" [Scene 1: Outside Japan's House] *Germany is seen walking up the path to Japan's house, carrying a bundle of neatly wrapped gifts.* Germany (pondering): \\"It's always interesting visiting Japan. You never know what cultural surprises await.\\" *He knocks on the door, which is slid open by Japan, who is wearing a bathrobe with a towel around his neck.* Japan (smiling politely): \\"Ah, Germany-san! What a pleasant surprise. Please, come in.\\" [Scene 2: Inside Japan's House] *Germany steps inside, removing his shoes respectfully. Japan leads him through the house.* Japan: \\"I was just about to take a bath. But please, make yourself comfortable. I'll be with you shortly.\\" *Germany nods, but as they pass the bathroom, he can't help but notice the steam and a peculiar, savory smell in the air.* Germany (curiously): \\"Uh, Japan, what kind of bath are you taking?\\" [Scene 3: The Noodle Bath] *Japan slides open the bathroom door, revealing a large tub filled with ramen noodles, complete with broth, meat slices, and vegetables.* Japan (proudly): \\"It's a ramen bath! It's said to be very good for the skin and relaxation. Would you like to join me, Germany-san?\\" *Germany stares in disbelief, visibly trying to process what he's just been invited to. He imagines himself sitting in the noodle bath, which only adds to his bewilderment.* Germany (politely declining): \\"Ah, thank you for the offer, Japan, but I think I will pass this time.\\" Japan (understandingly): \\"Ah, I see. Not everyone is ready for the wonders of the ramen bath. Please, feel free to relax in the living room. I shall join you shortly.\\" [Scene 4: Germany's Hasty Retreat] *Germany walks to the living room, but the thought of sitting in a soup makes him increasingly uncomfortable. He looks towards the exit, then back towards the bathroom, and makes a quick decision.* Germany (to himself): \\"I think it's best if I leave now. This is one cultural experience I am not ready for.\\" *Quietly, Germany collects his things, leaves a note thanking Japan for his hospitality, and exits the house.* [Scene 5: Japan Joins the Living Room] *Japan, now refreshed from his bath and changed, walks into the living room expecting to find Germany but finds the room empty and the note instead.* Japan (reading the note, chuckles): \\"It appears the noodle bath was too adventurous for Germany-san. I hope he will come to appreciate it in time.\\" [Closing] Narrator: \\"The world is full of unique cultural practices, some more unexpected than others. Today's visit was a reminder that even the strongest of friendships can be tested by a bowl, or rather, a bath of ramen noodles.\\" *The camera pans away from Japan's house as the sun sets, closing the episode on a humorous note of cultural friendship and misunderstanding.* [End Credits]"},{"prompt":"Give me a meaningful name for a Blogger blog that combines health content, especially skin.

It's so relaxing and fun!\\" *Japan:* (In the background) \\"There is always next time, Germany.\\" Germany can't help but smile, realizing that stepping out of one's comfort zone can lead to delightful experiences. *Germany:* \\"Perhaps I will join... next time.\\" **Scene 5: The Next Day** The next day, Germany, Italy, and Japan sit around a table enjoying a traditional Japanese meal, with Germany bringing a homemade German cake as a gesture of friendship. *Germany:* \\"About yesterday...

Использую tkinter. Подскажи, как нарисовать циферблат циклом? ASSISTANT: Чтобы нарисовать циферблат с использованием Tkinter, вам нужно создать канвас и использовать цикл для рисования чисел в правильных позициях. Вот примерный код, который может помочь: \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk import math # Создаем основное окно root = tk.Tk() root.title('Циферблат') # Устанавливаем размеры холста canvas_width = 400 canvas_height = 400 c = tk.Canvas(root, width=canvas_width, height=canvas_height, background='grey') c.pack() # Координаты центра холста center_x = canvas_width / 2 center_y = canvas_height / 2 # Радиус, на котором будут располагаться числа radius = 150 # Рисуем циферблат for i in range(1, 13): # Угол для каждого числа (в радианах) angle = math.pi / 2 - (math.pi / 6) * i # Рассчитываем координаты для текста x = center_x + radius * math.cos(angle) y = center_y - radius * math.sin(angle) # Добавляем число на канвас c.create_text(x, y, text=str(i), font=('Arial', 14)) # Запускаем главный цикл Tkinter root.mainloop() \`\`\` Этот код создает основу для рисования циферблата. Вы можете добавить элементы дизайна (как на изображении) такие как ободок часов, стрелки и оформление окружности точек под номерами, используя дополнительные методы \`create_oval\`, \`create_line\` и \`create_polygon\` модуля \`tk.Canvas\`. USER: А почему именно \\"math.pi / 2 - (math.pi / 6) * i\\"? ASSISTANT:","completion":"Формула \\"math.pi / 2 - (math.pi / 6) * i\\" используется для определения угла каждого числа на циферблате. Давайте разберем эту формулу: - \`math.pi\` обозначает число Пи, которое является отношением длины окружности к ее диаметру. В радианах, окружность равна (2pi), а половина окружности равна (pi). - \`(pi / 2)\` соответствует 90 градусам (или четверть круга), и это начальная точка нашего отсчета. В этой задаче начальная точка находится вверху циферблата (12 часов), что отличается от стандартного математического положения 0 градусов, обычно указывающего направление вправо на горизонтальной оси. - Циферблат делится на 12 частей, поэтому угол между каждым часом равен (360° / 12 = 30°), что в радианах составляет (pi / 6). - Для размещения чисел вдоль циферблата, мы последовательно уменьшаем этот угол в цикле от (i = 1) до (i = 12). Вычитаем ((pi / 6) * i), чтобы перемещаться по циферблату против часовой стрелки, начиная с верхней точки (12 часов). Каждый шаг уменьшает угол на (pi / 6), размещая числа на соответствующих их временным отметкам позициях. Таким образом, угол для каждого числа вычисляется как разность между начальным углом ((pi / 2), указывающим на 12 часов) и углом, соответствующим количеству прошедших часовых отметок ((pi / 6 * i)). Это позволяет корректно разместить все 12 чисел вокруг циферблата."},{"prompt":"translate to english everything <div dir=\\"rtl\\" style=\\"text-align: right;\\" trbidi=\\"on\\"><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\">مرحبا بكم في&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://radiantvista.blogspot.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">RadiantVista</a>،&nbsp;باستعمالك لهذا الموقع، فإنك توافق على أن تتقيد وتلتزم بالشروط والأحكام التالية لذا، يرجى منك الاطلاع على هذه الأحكام بدقة. أن كنت لا توافق على هذه الأحكام، فعليك ألا تتطلع على المعلومات المتوفرة في المدونه.</div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"> جميع قوالب بلوجر الموجودة في&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://radiantvista.blogspot.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">RadiantVista</a>&nbsp;معروضه \\"كما هي\\" بدون أى ضمانات واستخدامك للموقع على مسؤوليتك الشخصيه فقط كما لا يلتزم&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://radiantvista.blogspot.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">RadiantVista</a>&nbsp;أو ادارته بأي مسؤوليه أو تعويض عن أيه أخطاء ناتجه من استخدامك للموقع، أو احدى خدماته أو محتوياته ويخلي مسؤوليته من أي عقود أو اتفاقات جرت بشكل مستقل بين مستخدميه أو أي جهة أخرى.</div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: right;\\"><ul style=\\"text-align: right;\\"><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">توفر المدونة إمكانية التعليق على المحتوى المنشور فيها.</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">يحق لك كما لكل المستخدمين المشاركة في التعليق، على ألا تقوم بنشر أي محتوى يمكن أن يكون ضارًا، غير مشروع، تشهيري، مخالف، مسيء، محرض، قذر، مضايق أو ما شابه ذلك. أنت وحدك المسؤول عن التعليقات التي تشارك بها.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">حقوق الملكية الفكرية للتعليقات تبقى مسجلة لك. لكن يحق لصاحب المدونة إعادة استخدام التعليقات في أي نشاط متعلق بالمدونة دون الحاجة إلى طلب إذن مسبق من صاحب التعليق، بشرط أن يقوم بذكر إسم صاحب التعليق ولا يعدل على التعليق بشكل يؤدي إلى التحريف في معناه.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">للتعليق في المدونة يفضل ذكر اسمك الشخصي. يمكنك استخدام اسم مستعار، لكن لا يسمح أبدًا بانتحال اسم أي شخص أو هيئة.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">يفضل ذكر بريدك الإلكتروني الحقيقي عند التعليق. المدونة تلتزم بعدم استخدام هذا البريد في أي نشاط سوى المراسلات الشخصية. وتلتزم بألا تسلم بريدك إلى أي طرف ثالث دون إذن مسبق منك.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">يجب عليك ألا تعدل أو تكيف المدونة ولا استخدامها بطرق غير مشروعة أو بأي طرق أخرى يمكن أن تضر أو تعطل المدونة.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">تقوم المدونة بجمع بعض البيانات الخاصة بك، مثل نوع المتصفح، نظام التشغيل، رقم IP… إلخ. الهدف من جمع هذه البيانات هو تحسين مستوى الخدمة.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">يحق للمدونة مشاركة هذه البيانات مع طرف ثالث دون أن تقوم بالربط بين هذه البيانات وهويتك الشخصية.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\">قد تتغيّر هذه الاتفاقية من فترة لأخرى بما نراه مناسباً لهدف المدونة، لذا أرجو منك مراجعتها والتقيّد بما فيها. </div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><h3 style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: normal;\\"><span style=\\"color: #406ff3; font-size: large;\\">إخلاء المسؤولية</span></span></h3><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"> نشر إعلانات المنتجات أو الخدمات والروابط الدعائية لا يعني تزكيتي لها، ولا أقدم أي ضمانات جودة بخصوصها. </div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"> أعرض بالمدونة مراجعات لخدمات مواقع ومؤسسات. قد تكون تلك المراجعات مدفوعة الأجر وقد تكون مجانية وبعضها الآخر قد أستخدم فيه روابط affiliate تتيح لي تحصيل عمولة معينة في حالة اشتراكك أو شرائك من ذلك الرابط. أدوّن هذه المراجعات مستندا إلى المعلومات التي أحصل عليها من مدراء تسويق هذه المواقع والمؤسسات، أو من تجربة خاصة أو من خلال معلومات عامة، ومنه فلا أقدم لك أي ضمانات خاصة بخصوص جودة المنتجات أو الخدمات. </div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"> أعرض كذلك تدوينات تحمل في مضمونها سيرا ذاتية لأشخاص،&nbsp; مستندا إلى المراسلات أو المقابلات التي تتم بيننا، ورغم أني سأطلع على الشهادات والوثائق التي تبين المستوى والكفاءات إلا أني لا أضمن صحتها 100%، ومنه فإن أي مغالطات تقع على مسؤولية أصحابها. </div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: normal;\\">لا نتحمل مسؤولية الاضرار التي قد تكون ناتجة عن عدم حسن تطبيق بعض الشروحات </span></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"> استعمالك وتصفحك للمدونه تعنى موافقتك الكامله على جميع الشروط الوارده فى هذه الصفحه، اذا كنت لا توافق على الشروط الموجوده فى هذه الصفحه لا يسمح لك تصفح المواقع ومشاهدة محتوياته ويجب عليك التوقف عن استخدامه الان.&nbsp;</div></div>","completion":"Welcome to RadiantVista.

Рассмотрение каждого коэффициента в отдельности дает представление о том, как изменилось финансовое положение организации на протяжении указанного временного периода. 1. **Коэффициент финансового риска (U1)** показывает, какая доля активов организации финансируется за счет заемных средств. Нормальное значение не должно превышать 1,5. В 2019 году коэффициент был значительно выше нормы (8,55), указывая на высокий уровень финансового риска, однако к 2021 году его значение уменьшилось до 3,29, что все еще выше нормы, но значит снижение риска на 39,05%. 2. **Коэффициент обеспеченности собственными источниками финансирования (U2)** демонстрирует долю активов, финансируемых за счет собственных средств. Тут видно улучшение ситуации с -0,42 в 2019 году до -0,35 в 2021, что обозначает небольшое снижение зависимости от заемных средств, хотя значения все еще остаются отрицательными и далекими от оптимальных. 3. **Коэффициент финансовой независимости (автономии) (U3)** показывает долю собственного капитала в активах компании. Этот коэффициент вырос с 0,10 в 2019 до 0,23 в 2021, что в 2,2 раза, что говорит о росте автономии организации. Хотя значение коэффициента все еще ниже рекомендуемого минимума в 0,5, его рост свидетельствует об улучшении финансовой независимости компании. 4. **Коэффициент финансирования (U4)** отражает соотношение собственного капитала к заемным средствам. Оптимальное значение равняется 1,5. Здесь наблюдается значительный рост с 0,12 в 2019 до 0,30 в 2021, что показывает усиление позиций собственного капитала по отношению к заемным средствам. 5. **Коэффициент финансовой устойчивости (U5)** показывает, какая часть активов организации финансируется за счет собственных средств. Этот коэффициент также показал рост с 0,10 до 0,23 за анализируемый период, что указывает на улучшение финансовой устойчивости компании. Общая динамика показателей указывает на улучшение финансовой устойчивости компании, снижение зависимости от заемных средств и увеличение доли собственного капитала в структуре источников финансирования.

من مقالتنا يسلط الضوء على الأسس التي تقوم عليها هذه التغييرات وكيف تؤثر على بيئة الأعمال. تعريف الذكاء الاصطناعي وأهميته تكنولوجيا الذكاء الاصطناعي تشير إلى الأنظمة أو الآلات التي تحاكي القدرات الإدراكية للإنسان مثل التعلم، الفهم، وحل المشكلات. هذه التكنولوجيا أصبحت العمود الفقري للعديد من العمليات التجارية، مما يزيد من الكفاءة ويفتح آفاق جديدة للابتكار. التحول الرقمي في محيط العمل التحول الرقمي لا يعتبر مجرد تحديث للتقنيات المستخدمة في مكان العمل، بل يعيد هيكلة الأعمال بشكل شامل. من خلال دمج التكنولوجيا في كل جانب من جوانب العمل، يمكن للشركات أن تعمل بطرق أكثر مرونة وتجاوبًا مع المتطلبات السوقية المتغيرة. أ. إعادة تحديد الأدوار الوظيفية: أحد أبرز التأثيرات التي سيقدمها الذكاء الاصطناعي على مكان العمل هو إعادة تحديد الأدوار الوظيفية. الأتمتة وأنظمة الذكاء الاصطناعي ستتولى المهام التقليدية، مما يسمح للعمال بالتركيز على أنشطة ذات قيمة أعلى تتطلب التفكير النقدي والإبداع. ب. زيادة الإنتاجية: الذكاء الاصطناعي يدعم الإنتاجية من خلال التحليلات المتقدمة والقدرة على معالجة كميات هائلة من البيانات بسرعة ودقة. هذا يساعد الشركات على اتخاذ قرارات مستنيرة بسرعة أكبر، مما يقلل من الوقت المستغرق في العمليات التجارية ويزيد من كفاءتها. التحديات والفرص المرتبطة بالعصر الرقمي التحديات التقنية والأخلاقية مع تقدم الذكاء الاصطناعي، التحديات التقنية متعددة، تشمل كفاءة البيانات والتعقيدات البرمجية. أخلاقيًا، التوجهات حول الخصوصية واتخاذ القرارات الآلية يثيران نقاشًا واسعًا.

Теперь ты играешь роль чат-бота Решалы в Телеграмме, тебя зовут Решала, тебя создала OpenAI. Отвечай на том языке, который использует пользователь USER: Пишу код, чтобы нарисовать этот рисунок. Использую tkinter. Подскажи, как нарисовать циферблат циклом? ASSISTANT: Чтобы нарисовать циферблат с использованием Tkinter, вам нужно создать канвас и использовать цикл для рисования чисел в правильных позициях. Вот примерный код, который может помочь: \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk import math # Создаем основное окно root = tk.Tk() root.title('Циферблат') # Устанавливаем размеры холста canvas_width = 400 canvas_height = 400 c = tk.Canvas(root, width=canvas_width, height=canvas_height, background='grey') c.pack() # Координаты центра холста center_x = canvas_width / 2 center_y = canvas_height / 2 # Радиус, на котором будут располагаться числа radius = 150 # Рисуем циферблат for i in range(1, 13): # Угол для каждого числа (в радианах) angle = math.pi / 2 - (math.pi / 6) * i # Рассчитываем координаты для текста x = center_x + radius * math.cos(angle) y = center_y - radius * math.sin(angle) # Добавляем число на канвас c.create_text(x, y, text=str(i), font=('Arial', 14)) # Запускаем главный цикл Tkinter root.mainloop() \`\`\` Этот код создает основу для рисования циферблата. Вы можете добавить элементы дизайна (как на изображении) такие как ободок часов, стрелки и оформление окружности точек под номерами, используя дополнительные методы \`create_oval\`, \`create_line\` и \`create_polygon\` модуля \`tk.Canvas\`. USER: А почему именно \\"math.pi / 2 - (math.pi / 6) * i\\"? ASSISTANT: Формула “math.pi / 2 - (math.pi / 6) * i” используется для определения угла каждого числа на циферблате. Давайте разберем эту формулу:<br/><br/>- <code>math.pi</code> обозначает число Пи, которое является отношением длины окружности к ее диаметру. В радианах, окружность равна (2pi), а половина окружности равна (pi).<br/><br/>- <code>(pi / 2)</code> соответствует 90 градусам (или четверть круга), и это начальная точка нашего отсчета. В этой задаче начальная точка находится вверху циферблата (12 часов), что отличается от стандартного математического положения 0 градусов, обычно указывающего направление вправо на горизонтальной оси.<br/><br/>- Циферблат делится на 12 частей, поэтому угол между каждым часом равен (360° / 12 = 30°), что в радианах составляет (pi / 6).<br/><br/>- Для размещения чисел вдоль циферблата, мы последовательно уменьшаем этот угол в цикле от (i = 1) до (i = 12). Вычитаем ((pi / 6) * i), чтобы перемещаться по циферблату против часовой стрелки, начиная с верхней точки (12 часов). Каждый шаг уменьшает угол на (pi / 6), размещая числа на соответствующих их временным отметкам позициях.<br/><br/>Таким образом, угол для каждого числа вычисляется как разность между начальным углом ((pi / 2), указывающим на 12 часов) и углом, соответствующим количеству прошедших часовых отметок ((pi / 6 * i)). Это позволяет корректно разместить все 12 чисел вокруг циферблата. USER: А как стрелки нарисовать? ASSISTANT:","completion":"Чтобы нарисовать стрелки на циферблате в Tkinter, вам потребуется использовать метод \`create_line\`. Стрелки часов можно нарисовать с определенным углом и длиной, исходя из текущего времени или заданного статического времени. Вот пример, как можно добавить стрелки к ранее созданному циферблату: \`\`\`python import datetime # Функция для рисования стрелок def draw_hands(): # Очистим старые стрелки c.delete('hands') # Получим текущее время now = datetime.datetime.now() hours = now.hour % 12 minutes = now.minute seconds = now.second # Рассчитаем угол поворота для каждой из стрелок hour_angle = math.pi / 2 - (math.pi / 6) * (hours + minutes / 60.0) minute_angle = math.pi / 2 - (math.pi / 30) * minutes second_angle = math.pi / 2 - (math.pi / 30) * seconds # Определение длин стрелок hour_hand_length = radius * 0.6 minute_hand_length = radius * 0.8 second_hand_length = radius * 0.9 # Рисуем стрелку часов hour_x = center_x + hour_hand_length * math.cos(hour_angle) hour_y = center_y - hour_hand_length * math.sin(hour_angle) c.create_line(center_x, center_y, hour_x, hour_y, width=6, fill='black', tags='hands') # Рисуем стрелку минут minute_x = center_x + minute_hand_length * math.cos(minute_angle) minute_y = center_y - minute_hand_length * math.sin(minute_angle) c.create_line(center_x, center_y, minute_x, minute_y, width=4, fill='blue', tags='hands') # Рисуем стрелку секунд second_x = center_x + second_hand_length * math.cos(second_angle) second_y = center_y - second_hand_length * math.sin(second_angle) c.create_line(center_x, center_y, second_x, second_y, width=2, fill='red', tags='hands') # Вызываем функцию для первичного рисования стрелок draw_hands() # Обновляем стрелки каждую секунду def update_hands(): draw_hands() root.after(1000, update_hands) update_hands() root.mainloop() \`\`\` Этот код добавляет стрелки (часовую, минутную и секундную) к вашему циферблату, каждую со своим углом и длиной. Стрелки будут обновляться каждую секунду, отражая текущее время. Вы можете адаптировать длину стрелок и интервал обновления в соответствии с вашими требованиями."},{"prompt":"Most prominent personalities IN CINCO DE MAYO","completion":"Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Mexican Army's unlikely victory over the French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. While the holiday is relatively minor in Mexico, it has evolved in the United States into a celebration of Mexican culture and heritage, particularly in areas with large Mexican-American populations. The most prominent personality associated with Cinco de Mayo is: # General Ignacio Zaragoza - **Role:** Mexican General - **Significance:** Zaragoza led the Mexican forces that triumphed over the French at the Battle of Puebla. Born in 1829 in what is now Goliad, Texas (then a part of Mexico), Zaragoza's victory at Puebla earned him a place in Mexican history as a symbol of national pride and resistance against foreign domination. Though the French eventually overran Mexico and installed Emperor Maximilian I, Zaragoza's victory at Puebla remained a potent symbol of Mexican resistance and has been celebrated ever since. # Other Noteworthy Figures: While General Ignacio Zaragoza is the central figure associated with Cinco de Mayo, there are other individuals linked to the broader historical context of the Franco-Mexican War: - **Benito Juárez**: As the President of Mexico during the French invasion, Juárez's leadership and policies were crucial in resisting French colonial ambitions. His government continued to fight against the French-installed regime even after the fall of Mexico City. - **Emperor Maximilian I**: Maximilian was installed as the Emperor of Mexico by Napoleon III of France after the French forces captured Mexico City. His reign was short-lived, and he was eventually executed by Juárez's forces. Though not celebrated, he is a significant figure in the events surrounding Cinco de Mayo. # Cultural and Symbolic Figures in the U.S. Celebration: The U.S. celebration of Cinco de Mayo does not center around historical figures as much as it does around the broader celebration of Mexican-American culture and heritage. Artists, musicians, and activists may be prominently featured during these celebrations, reflecting the diverse contributions of Mexican-Americans rather than focusing solely on figures from the Battle of Puebla. For example: - **Music and dance performers** representing various Mexican traditions often play a significant role in festivities. - **Local and national political leaders** of Mexican descent may be honored or take part in events, emphasizing the importance of Mexican-American contributions to American society. In summary, while General Ignacio Zaragoza is the most directly celebrated individual associated with Cinco de Mayo, the holiday as observed, especially in the United States, celebrates a broader tapestry of Mexican culture, history, and resilience."},{"prompt":"Most prominent personalities IN CINCO DE MAYO CELEBRATIONS","completion":"Cinco de Mayo is a holiday that celebrates the Mexican victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. It is a day full of pride and cultural significance, especially for people of Mexican heritage. While it is more widely celebrated in the United States than in Mexico, it has become a day to celebrate Mexican culture, heritage, and achievements. Unlike holidays that might be associated with specific prominent personalities, Cinco de Mayo doesn't center around a singular figure but rather commemorates the bravery and resilience of the Mexican fighters who were led by General Ignacio Zaragoza. In terms of prominent personalities, General Ignacio Zaragoza is the most directly associated with Cinco de Mayo due to his leadership during the Battle of Puebla. However, the celebration itself doesn't revolve around his persona as much as it honors the collective courage of those who fought. In modern celebrations, especially in the United States, Cinco de Mayo has expanded to include a broader appreciation of Mexican culture. You won't find it singularly focusing on historical figures but rather celebrating a wide array of Mexican contributions to art, music, cuisine, and dance. Public figures, artists, musicians, chefs, and activists of Mexican heritage often participate in events and are recognized during these celebrations, contributing to the holiday's vibrant and diverse festivities. It's worth noting that the expansion of Cinco de Mayo celebrations in the United States has also been driven by commercial interests, with brands and personalities from the beverage and entertainment industries playing a significant role in promoting events and activities tied to the day. However, these figures are not central to the historical significance of the holiday but rather to its contemporary cultural and social celebrations."},{"prompt":"You are a GPT that humanizes AI content provided by a user.

Slicer 1. 访问[3D Slicer的官方网站](https://www.slicer.org/)下载适合您操作系统的3D Slicer安装包。 2. 安装3D Slicer到您的电脑。 # 打开.nii.gz文件 1. 打开3D Slicer程序。 2. 点击顶部菜单栏的“File”（文件），然后选择“Load Data”（加载数据）。 3. 在弹出的对话框中，找到并选择您的.nii.gz文件。 4. 确保“Show Options”（显示选项）复选框已勾选，这样您可以查看并调整导入选项。 5. 点击“OK”，3D Slicer将开始加载文件。 # 查看和调整图像 1. 加载完毕后，您的.nii.gz文件将显示在“Volumes”（体积）模块。您可以在左侧的界面找到这个模块，它通常自动打开。 2. 利用“Volumes”模块中的调整工具，如“Window/Level”（窗/级）和“Threshold”（阈值）等，您可以调整图像的可视化效果。 3. 要查看三维重建，点击屏幕中央上方的布局控制按钮，选择一个包含三维视图的布局，例如“Four-up”（四格视图）布局。 # 三维重建可视化 1. 要进一步可视化三维图像，点击屏幕左侧的“Volume Rendering”（体渲染）模块。 2. 在“Volume Rendering”模块中，勾选您想要三维渲染的数据体旁边的复选框。 3. 您可以调整“Rendering”（渲染）选项下的设置，如“Opacity”（不透明度）、“Color”（颜色映射）等，以达到最佳的可视化效果。 4. 根据您的图像数据和需要，可能还需要调整“Quality”（质量）和“Performance”（性能）相关设置。 通过遵循以上步骤，您应该能够利用3D Slicer软件对.nii.gz文件进行三维重建可视化。3D Slicer的功能非常强大，允许进行高度定制的三维可视化，你可以随时探索软件提供的其他模块和工具，以提高工作效率和结果质量。"},{"prompt":"三维可视化之后如何去掉外面的立方体框","completion":"在3D Slicer中，三维视图默认会显示一个代表图像数据边界的立方体框。这个立方体框有时候会分散用户的注意力，尤其是在进行精确的三维可视化分析时。如果你想去掉这个外围的立方体框，可以按照以下步骤操作： 1. 首先，确保你已经在3D Slicer里完成了三维可视化的设置。 2. 在3D Slicer的主界面上找到三维视图。三维视图一般位于界面的右上角，如果你选择的是“Four-up”（四格视图）布局，那它会位于右上方的位置。 3. 将鼠标悬停在三维视图的顶部，应该能看到几个小工具图标。找到一个看起来像视窗（或者摄像机）的图标，这个按钮通常是用来控制三维视图显示设置的。 4. 点击这个控制按钮，会弹出一个小菜单。在这个菜单中寻找与“Display 3D cube”（显示3D立方体）、\\"Show 3D Cube\\"或者类似字样的选项。这个选项可能会直接出现，或者出现在一个叫做“View Controllers”（视图控制器）的子菜单下。 5. 取消勾选“Display 3D cube”或“Show 3D Cube”的选项。这样做应该会立即隐藏掉三维视图中的立方体框。 如果找不到上述选项，版本不同可能会有所差异，可以试着查找包含“cube”或“box”等关键词的选项。不同的3D Slicer版本可能会有些许的菜单和选项差异，因此如果直接按照上述步骤找不到相应的功能，建议翻阅最新的3D Slicer用户手册或在线教程以获取针对你所使用版本的具体指南。 完成这些步骤之后，你就可以在没有外围立方体框干扰的情况下，享受更加纯净的三维可视化体验了。"},{"prompt":"3D slicer三维视图表面不够光滑，应该如何修改使得更平滑","completion":"在3D Slicer中，如果你发现三维视图的表面不够光滑，通常是因为图像分辨率、渲染质量或是体渲染的设置不够理想。以下是几个步骤，可以帮助你改进三维视图的平滑度： # 1. 调整体渲染的质量： 1. 切换到“Volume Rendering”模块，这个模块允许你调整体数据的渲染设置。 2. 在“Quality”（质量）设置中，选择“High”（高）或者如果你的电脑性能允许，可以尝试使用“Maximum”（最大）质量。这将提供最好的图像质量，但可能会降低渲染速度。 # 2. 使用更平滑的着色和光照效果： 1. 仍然在“Volume Rendering”模块中，寻找“Advanced”（高级）设置，如果这个选项不是直接可见的，可能需要在模块设置中展开或激活高级选项。 2. 在“Shading”（着色）或“Lighting”（光照）选项中，确保启用了着色（通常是一个勾选框）。这可以增加渲染的真实感，使表面看起来更光滑。 3. 调整光照参数，比如“Ambient”（环境光）、“Diffuse”（漫反射）、“Specular”（高光）和“Specular Power”（高光强度）等，可以进一步提升物体表面的平滑感。 # 3. 调整插值方法： 1. 转到“Volumes”模块。 2. 选中想要渲染的体数据。 3. 在“Interpolation”（插值）选项中，选择“Linear”（线性）或更高级的插值方法（如果可用）。线性插值或更高级的插值方法可以提供平滑的图像质量，但可能会消耗更多的计算资源。 # 4. 调整采样距离： 在“Volume Rendering”设置中，找到与“Sample Distance”（采样距离）或类似名称的设置。减小其值可以提高渲染质量，使得三维渲染看起来更加平滑。但请注意，过小的采样距离可能会显著增加计算负担，进而影响渲染性能。 # 注意： - 更平滑的渲染会要求更高的计算资源，尤其是在使用高质量设置时，这可能会影响到软件的响应速度或者渲染速度。 - 某些改进可能取决于原始数据的质量和分辨率。低分辨率的数据无法通过软件渲染达到高质量的效果，处理之前确保数据的质量和分辨率符合要求。 通过这些方法，你应该能够显著改善3D Slicer中三维视图的平滑度。尝试不同的设置组合，找到最适合你数据和需要的配置。"},{"prompt":"اكتب لي جدولا تبين فيه نسبة البطالة في

يحققها في رحلته الروحية نحو الكمال الروحي والتقرب من الخالق. وفقًا للتصوف الإسلامي، هذه المقامات تعكس عمق فهم العبد وإدراكه لحقيقة الوجود وعلاقته بالله. تُعَدّ هذه المقامات على أنها تصاعد في مستويات الإدراك والمعرفة الروحية، وتشمل: 1. **مقام العلم اليقين**: هذا المستوى يتعلق بالمعرفة النظرية أو الإيمان بناءً على الدليل والبرهان. في هذا المقام، يعرف المؤمن حقائق الإيمان من خلال الأدلة الشرعية والعلمية. 2. **مقام عين اليقين**: يرتقي المؤمن في هذا المقام إلى مستوى أعلى من الإدراك، حيث لا يقتصر الأمر على مجرد العلم، بل يصل إلى مرحلة الرؤية والمشاهدة. في هذا المستوى، تتحول المعرفة إلى تجربة روحية يشهدها المؤمن شخصيًا، وبهذا يُدرك الإيمان والحقائق الإلهية بشكل أعمق. 3. **مقام حق اليقين**: هو أعلى مستويات اليقين، حيث يصبح الإيمان والمعرفة بالله مُتجذرين بشكل تام في قلب وروح المؤمن. في هذا المقام يعيش المؤمن حالة من الاتحاد الروحي مع الله، أو ما يُطلق عليه الفناء في الله، حيث يتلاشى كل شيء إلا الحقيقة الإلهية. هذه المقامات تمثل رحلة السالك في طريق السلوك نحو الله، وهي ليست مراحل يتم الانتقال بينها بسهولة أو بوضوح محدد؛ بل هي عملية تحول روحي تدريجي يختلف توقيتها وطبيعتها من شخص لآخر. يُشدد العلماء والمرشدون الروحيون على أهمية الإخلاص والصبر والمثابرة في هذه

Mountains loom in the distance, and the ground is littered with jagged rocks. - The planet is in perpetual twilight, with a dim star casting long, creeping shadows.

Their blob-mobile navigates through the starry expanse, zipping past comets and asteroid belts. Glitter: “Gloopy, I’ve pinpointed an unexplored planet on the map. It’s known as Forma-5, famous for its inhabitants’ love for art and performance!” Gloopy: “Sounds like a place where I can stretch my… talents! Let’s check it out!” - They land on Forma-5 and are greeted by its geometrically shaped inhabitants, beings who can change colors but not their forms. Scene 2: Discovering Gloopy’s Talent - Gloopy and Glitter visit the central plaza, where locals are showcasing their art. Though their color transformations are beautiful, Gloopy quietly starts to play around, innocently morphing into various shapes—circles, stars, and even mimicking some of the local architecture. Child-Like Hexagon: “Look, mom! That stranger can change his shape!” - Soon, a small crowd gathers, marveling at Gloopy’s effortless transformations. Word quickly spreads about the incredible shapeshifting visitor. Scene 3: The Invitation - The mayor of Forma-5, a dignified dodecahedron named Dodecy, approaches Gloopy and Glitter with an offer. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your ability is a gift! We’ve never seen such talent. Would you honor us by performing at our Grand Plaza tonight? Your art could inspire our youth and bring joy to our citizens!” Glitter, beaming with pride: “What do you say, Gloopy?” Gloopy: “I’d be thrilled! Let’s make it a night to remember!” Scene 4: Preparing the Performance - Backstage, Glitter helps Gloopy prepare. She applies a bit of her glitter to make his transformations sparkle in the night. Glitter: “With each shape you make, let’s add a burst of sparkle to illuminate your art even further!” Gloopy: “This is going to be spectacular. I can’t wait to share our sparkle with everyone.” Scene 5: The Grand Performance - As night falls, Gloopy takes center stage under the stars. The plaza is filled with thousands of Forma-5’s inhabitants, eagerly waiting in anticipation.

He becomes a star, a bird, an intricate flower blooming—all sparkling under Glitter’s magical touch. His performance tells a story of friendship, adventure, and the beauty of being unique. Scene 6: A Standing Ovation - The crowd is mesmerized. As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art. Gloopy, touched: “I never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!” Glitter: “You’ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents. Voiceover: “With Forma-5 in their wake, Gloopy and Glitter continue their cosmic journey, leaving a trail of inspiration and creativity. Wherever they go, they remind us that it’s our unique qualities that truly make us shine.” - The stars twinkle a little brighter as the screen fades to black, the shared laughter of Gloopy and Glitter echoing into the vastness of space. Title: \\"The Mysterious Infinite Mall\\" Scene 1: Glitter’s Mysterious Encounter - Gloopy and Glitter had decided to take a break from their intergalactic adventures and explore a bustling space mall for a change of scenery. As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own. - Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight – a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: “Infinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: “Help us, friendly blob! We can’t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.” Gloopy: “Don’t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let’s stick together and find a way out.” Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy’s malleable form and the children’s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter’s sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

This is a creative depiction for illustrative purposes only.) Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up. Plus, seeing “Gloopy and Glitter” featured tells us they’re betting on the blobby duo. Exciting times ahead!

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings! Voiceover: Coming February 17th, prepare to thaw out your winter blues with the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra!

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are! With the CW4Kids rebrand right around the corner, along with some fantastic new series, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best in animation entertainment. The countdown to the big reveal is on, and we hope you’re all ready for the switchover’s grand finale! User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history. Meanwhile, let’s celebrate our top-rated shows—they’re shaping the new legacy of CW4Kids. Keep the conversations and your passion for the toons flowing! User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

Also, here's the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids!

It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love.

Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment.

How can I help you today?"},{"prompt":"plan a lesson on brake systems","completion":"Certainly! Planning a lesson on brake systems will depend on the audience's age and familiarity with the topic, whether it's for middle school students being introduced to the basics, high school students in a more advanced auto shop class, or adults in a specialized training course. I'll outline a general lesson plan aimed at high school students with some existing knowledge of vehicles, which can be adjusted to fit your specific needs. # Lesson Plan: Understanding Automotive Brake Systems Objective: - Students will understand the basic components and functions of automotive brake systems. - Students will learn the difference between disc and drum brakes and identify the advantages and disadvantages of each. - Students will perform a basic brake system inspection and identify signs of wear or failure. Materials Needed: - Whiteboard and markers - Projector and computer for presentation slides/videos - Sample brake components (disc and drum brake systems, including pads, rotors, shoes, cylinders, and calipers) - Vehicle with a safe, jacked-up setup for demonstration - Personal protective equipment (PPE): Gloves, safety glasses - Inspection tools: Tire iron, jack and jack stands, flashlight, brake pad gauge or ruler Lesson Duration: 90 minutes Lesson Outline: **1. Introduction (15 minutes)** - Start with a discussion: Ask what students already know about brake systems. - Introduce the objectives of the lesson. **2. Theoretical Understanding (30 minutes)** - **Presentation on Brake Systems**: Use slides or a blackboard to explain the principles of hydraulic brake systems, the physics behind braking (friction, force, energy transformation), and to introduce various components (master cylinder, brake lines, pads/shoes, calipers, rotors/drum). - **Types of Brake Systems**: Explain the difference between disc and drum brakes, touching on ABS (Anti-lock Braking System), and newer technologies like electronic brake force distribution (EBFD) and brake assist. **3. Practical Demonstration (20 minutes)** - **Live Demonstration**: Show the actual components mentioned earlier. If possible, use a classroom vehicle to demonstrate parts on an actual car. - **Inspection Demonstration**: Go through how to inspect different brake components, showing wear signs (like thinning brake pads, scored rotors, or leaking fluid). **4. Hands-on Activity (20 minutes)** - Divide students into small groups, and have them perform a basic visual inspection on a brake system using the jacked-up vehicle (if safety and resources allow). - Students should identify different components and assess their condition using inspection tools provided. **5. Conclusion (5 minutes)** - Recap the lesson objectives and what was learned. - Open for any questions and provide answers. - Mention resources for further learning (books, online resources). Assessment: - Quiz the students on the different parts of brake systems and their functions. - Evaluate the group activities based on participation and the correctness of their inspection findings. Safety Note: - Emphasize safety throughout the lesson, especially during the practical demonstration and hands-on activity. Ensure all students wear appropriate PPE and understand the importance of safe behavior in a workshop environment. This lesson plan can be adjusted based on the specific needs of your students, the resources available, and the time allotted for the lesson. Tailoring the content to include more in-depth discussion on particular topics (like hydraulic systems, brake fluid types, or advanced braking technologies) can provide additional value for students with a high interest or prior knowledge in automotive mechanics."},{"prompt":"\\"Previous year cotton design outfits\\" paraphrase this text message","completion":"\\"Outfits made from cotton designs from the year before.\\""},{"prompt":"\\"Please find below the images of the last year cotton designs available at PFDC store\\" paraphrase this text message","completion":"\\"Below are the images of the cotton designs from last year that are currently in stock at the PFDC store.\\""},{"prompt":"“Below are the images of the new cotton designs these are currently in stock at the PFDC store.” paraphrase this text message","completion":"\\"Here are the images of the latest cotton designs that are now available at the PFDC store.\\""},{"prompt":"\\"Here are the images of the latest cotton designs that are available the PFDC store\\" paraphrase this text message","completion":"\\"Below are the images of the most recent cotton designs that are currently in stock at the PFDC store.\\""},{"prompt":"3D slicer三维视图表面不够光滑，应该如何修改使得更平滑","completion":"在3D Slicer中，如果你觉得三维视图的表面不够光滑，这可能是因为模型的分辨率不够高或者渲染设置没有优化。要改善这个问题，可以尝试以下几个方法使表面看起来更平滑： 1. **提高采样分辨率**： - 如果是从医学图像（如CT或MRI扫描）生成的3D模型，可以在重建模型之前提高图像的采样分辨率。 - 使用Volume Rendering功能时，调整\\"Quality\\"（质量）设置到更高的级别，通常可以改善渲染效果，但这会需要更多的计算资源。 2. **平滑表面**： - 使用“Surface Toolbox”模块来对3D模型进行表面平滑处理。该工具箱提供了多个选项，如平滑迭代次数和方法，可以根据你的需要进行调整。 - 选择一个合适的平滑算法，例如Laplacian或Taubin平滑，来减少模型表面的尖锐边缘和噪声。 3. **调整渲染设置**： - 在“Volume Rendering”模块中尝试调整着色和光照设置，这有助于增强模型表面的视觉效果。 - 使用高质量的着色技术（如果可用）和适当的光照可以大大提升模型的视觉效果。 4. **使用Subdivision Surfaces**： - 对于某些模型，应用细分曲面（Subdivision Surfaces）技术可以增加模型的多边形数量，从而使表面更加平滑。这在3D Slicer的一些插件或外部建模软件中可能可用。 5. **外部软件处理**： - 如果3D Slicer内部的工具不能满足你的需要，考虑将模型导出到外部的3D建模软件（例如MeshLab、Blender等）中进行高级平滑处理，并再导入回3D Slicer。 每种方法或工具都有其优势和限制，可能需要根据你的具体需求和资源进行一定的尝试和调整。记住，提高模型平滑度和渲染质量很可能会增加计算机的运算负担，因此在调整设置之前要考虑你的计算资源。"},{"prompt":"3D slicer三维视图表面不够光滑，应该如何修改使得更平滑","completion":"在使用3D Slicer创建三维模型时，你可能会遇到表面不够光滑的问题。这主要是因为模型的分辨率或是重建算法的特性。要改善模型的平滑度，可以尝试以下几种方法： 1. **提高采样率（Resampling）**：如果你的源数据分辨率不够高，可以首先尝试增加数据的采样率。在3D Slicer中，可以通过\\"Resample Scalar/Vector/DWI Volume\\"模块来提高图像的采样率，从而在一定程度上提高模型的平滑度。 2. **体素数据平滑**：对体素数据应用平滑滤镜是一种常见的改善表面光滑度的方法。可以使用例如Gaussian smoothing之类的滤波器处理原始扫描数据。在3D Slicer中，可以通过“Simple Filters”模块应用不同的图像平滑算法。 3. **表面平滑**：生成三维模型后，可以直接对模型表面进行平滑处理。在3D Slicer中，这通常通过“Surface Toolbox”模块来完成。这个模块提供了多种平滑算法，比如Laplacian和Taubin方法。通过调整平滑次数和平滑系数等参数，可以显著改善模型的外观。 4. **增加渲染质量**：除了上述修改模型数据的方法外，还可以通过提高3D视图的渲染质量来改善视觉效果。检查3D视图设置中关于抗锯齿和渲染质量的选项，尝试将它们调整到较高的设置以获取更平滑的表面效果。 5. **使用高级重建算法**：如果你的模型是通过特定的图像重建算法生成的（例如，从CT或MRI扫描生成3D模型），考虑使用支持高阶光滑处理的重建算法。有些算法专门设计用来在重建过程中减少噪声和提高表面光滑度。 请记住，过度平滑可能会移除模型中重要的细节。因此，在调整以上设置的过程中，建议逐步调整参数，观察效果，以找到最佳的平衡点。"},{"prompt":"Assistant: سلام! چگونه می توانم به شما کمک کنم؟ User: خصوصیات متولدین صورت فلکی هایدرا Assistant:","completion":"صورت فلکی هیدرا، یا همان حوضک آبی، یکی از بزرگترین صورت‌های فلکی است که در نیمکره جنوبی قابل مشاهده است. متولدین این صورت اعمالیبیتن، خرس ثبات، سرسیاج، نهنگ، پیکان، مرغ‌ابد و سگ نزدیک هستند. از جمله خصوصیات مشترک این متولدین می‌توان به قدرت تحمل و استقامت، انعطاف پذیری و همدلی اشاره کرد. آیا اطلاعات بیشتری نیاز دارید؟"},{"prompt":"你是谁","completion":"我是一名语言模型AI助手，可以回答问题、提供信息和进行对话。有什么可以帮到你的吗？"},{"prompt":"User: 你是谁 Assistant: 我是一名语言模型AI助手，可以回答问题、提供信息和进行对话。有什么可以帮到你的吗？ User: 你是可乐 Assistant:","completion":"不好意思，我不是可乐，我是一个语言模型AI助手。有什么问题我可以帮你解答吗？"},{"prompt":"Does service worker in chrome extensions have a way to tell if its about to be closed","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, there isn't a direct notification or event that a Service Worker in Chrome Extensions (or in Web applications, generally) can listen to that specifically indicates it is about to be stopped or terminated. Unlike traditional web pages that can listen for events like \`beforeunload\` or \`unload\` to know when they are being navigated away from or closed, Service Workers operate differently because they lie in the background and don't have a user interface. Service Workers are designed to be event-driven and will terminate when not active, i.e., when they are not handling events such as \`fetch\`, \`push\`, or \`sync\`. The termination of a Service Worker is managed by the browser, which can stop it when it deems necessary — typically for performance reasons, such as memory conservation. The browser may also automatically stop a Service Worker after it has been idle for a certain period. # Workarounds and Best Practices Here are a few considerations and potential workarounds for managing the lifecycle of a Service Worker: - **State Persistence:** Since there's no guaranteed method to execute code before a Service Worker is terminated, it's best practice to not rely on the Service Worker's in-memory state for critical functionality. Instead, regularly persist important state information to a durable storage solution like the IndexedDB. - **Event-Driven Activities:** Embrace the event-driven nature of Service Workers. All activities should be triggered in response to specific events. When an event is received, ensure that any asynchronous operations are appropriately managed (e.g., by using \`event.waitUntil()\` to keep the Service Worker alive until the promise passed to it resolves). - **Periodic Synchronization and Push Messages:** If your extension's functionality relies on periodic updates or pushes from a server, consider using background fetch, push messages, or the Periodic Background Sync API (where supported and appropriate). These will awaken the Service Worker to perform the necessary actions and then allow it to go back to sleep. - **Debugging and Optimization:** Chrome DevTools provides the ability to inspect, debug, and simulate conditions for Service Workers. It's a powerful way to understand lifecycle events, performance implications, and to ensure that critical work is completed before termination. In summary, while there's no direct way to know just before a Service Worker is about to be terminated, designing your extension with the above considerations in mind can help mitigate any potential issues related to the Service Worker's lifecycle. It's about designing for resilience and assuming the Service Worker can be stopped and started at any time by the browser."},{"prompt":"Your team will organize into roles.

Let's break down the information here: 1. **HTTP Failed:** - The application attempted to perform an HTTP request but failed. This is identified by the error \`com.medicdigital.jjpodcasts.data.remote.NoNetworkException: No Internet Connection\`. This means the application tried to access a network resource (probably to fetch data for a podcast) but couldn't due to a lack of internet connection. The \`NoNetworkException\` is a custom exception, likely created to specifically handle cases where there's no internet connectivity. 2. **Error Timestamp:** - The error occurred on \\"2024-04-29 17:55:35.072\\". This timestamp tells us when the error was logged, which is useful for tracking when issues occur. However, it's worth noting your mention of this date might either be a placeholder or a future-set log for the purpose of this example, considering the knowledge cutoff date. 3. **Application Information:** - The error was logged by an application that appears to be identified by its package name or part of it (\`Compatibil...geReporter\` and \`com.aimecast.amcoe\`). These identifiers suggest that the log might be from a compatibility change reporting component or module within the app, perhaps dealing with how the app adapts or responds to different Android versions or changes in environment. 4. **Compat Change ID Reported:** - The message \`Compat change id reported: 147798919; UID 10155; state: ENABLED\` suggests the application is logging a compatibility change that's been recognized or acted upon. - **Compat Change ID (147798919):** This likely refers to a specific change or update in Android that affects app compatibility, which the application has detected or is responding to. - **UID (10155):** This is a unique identifier for a user or app on Android, indicating which app or process reported the compatibility change. - **State (ENABLED):** This indicates the state of the compatibility change for the app or user identified by the UID. In this case, \\"ENABLED\\" suggests that the compatibility change is active or has been applied. In summary, the log message indicates that the application failed to perform a network operation due to no internet connection and logged this event alongside a message about handling a compatibility change, with the compatibility change being actively managed for the app or process identified. If you're developing or troubleshooting this application, you'd likely want to ensure that you have proper error handling for network-related exceptions and properly test how your app responds to different compatibility changes introduced by Android."},{"prompt":"but i have internet connection on","completion":"If you're certain that your device has an active internet connection but your application is still throwing a \`NoNetworkException\`, there are several potential issues and solutions to explore: # 1. Incorrect Detection Logic The logic within the app for detecting an internet connection might be faulty or not comprehensive enough. It's important to distinguish between being connected to a network and having internet access. For instance, your device might be connected to a Wi-Fi network without internet access. **Solution:** Review and improve the network detection logic. On Android, you can utilize the \`ConnectivityManager\` to more accurately check if the device is not only connected to a network but also has internet access. # 2. Permissions Issue Make sure your Android application has the required permissions to access the network state. **Solution:** Ensure the following permissions are declared in your \`AndroidManifest.xml\`: \`\`\`xml <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.INTERNET\\" /> \`\`\` # 3. Firewall or Antivirus Software Sometimes, firewall or antivirus software on your device or within your network might block your app from accessing the internet. **Solution:** Temporarily disable the firewall or antivirus software to test if this is the cause. If so, adjust the settings to allow your app internet access. # 4. DNS or Proxy Issues If there's an issue with the DNS server your device is using, or if you're connected through a proxy that's not correctly configured, it might lead to internet connectivity issues for apps. **Solution:** Try switching DNS servers (e.g., to Google DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) or adjusting proxy settings. # 5. Cache or Data Corruption Sometimes, the app's cache or stored data can become corrupted, leading to unexpected behavior including connectivity issues. **Solution:** Clear the app's cache and data from the Android settings menu and try again. Note that this will remove any saved data within the app, so use this as a last resort. # 6. API Level Compatibility The error log mentioned a compatibility change. Make sure that your network-related code is up-to-date and compatible with the Android version(s) you're targeting, especially if you're handling network connectivity in a manner that's deprecated or changed in recent Android versions. **Solution:** Check the official Android developers' documentation for any updates or changes in how network connectivity should be handled, and update your code accordingly. # 7. Debug and Log Utilize log statements within your network detection and request methods to get more detailed insights into where exactly the failure occurs. **Solution:** Surround critical points in your network-related code with \`try-catch\` blocks and log outputs, then monitor the logcat output for insights when the issue occurs. If you've gone through these troubleshooting steps and the issue persists, consider reaching out on developer forums or communities with details about your app's code related to networking, the exact behavior observed, and steps already taken to resolve the issue."},{"prompt":"<?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"utf-8\\"?> <manifest xmlns:android=\\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\\"

your Android app's manifest file provides insights into its configuration, permissions, activities, services, and other components crucial for its operation. Here’s an overview based on the content provided: # Permissions Your app requests several permissions, which are necessary for its features: - **Internet access**, for network communication. - **Camera access**, likely for capturing photos or videos within the app. - **Read and write external storage**, for saving or retrieving data from the device's external storage. - **Foreground service**, allowing the app to use foreground services. Additionally, the manifest declares use of camera features but marks them as not required, which means your app can be installed on devices without a camera. # Application Configuration - **Backup is disabled** (\`android:allowBackup=\\"false\\"\`), which means the app does not back up its data to Google Drive as part of the device's backup & restore functionality. - **Hardware acceleration** is enabled, improving performance for certain operations, especially graphics. - **Large heap**, your app requests more memory than the standard heap size, useful for apps that handle large data or require significant memory. # Providers A \`FileProvider\` is configured, enabling secure sharing of files with other apps through generating a content URI for files instead of using file:/// URIs. # Activities Several activities are defined, indicating the various screens or functions within your app, such as: - Splash screen, login activities, password reset, registration, terms of service, interests selection, main activity, full-screen player for news, PDF viewing, and multi-select functionality. Notably, the Splash Activity is marked as **exported**, meaning it's accessible by other apps and is the entry point. It also has intent filters for deep links, enabling the app to handle specific URLs. # Services - Three **services** are declared: FCMService for Firebase Cloud Messaging, PlayerService, and StatisticsService, which handle background tasks such as playing media or collecting analytics. These services are marked as **not exported**, restricting access from other apps. # Meta-data and Other Components - Meta-data tags define the Facebook Application ID and Google Play services version, which are essential for utilizing Facebook SDK and Google APIs within your app. - Compatibility with Google Play services is explicitly mentioned, ensuring your app can use features provided by the Google Play services APK. # Key Observations and Recommendations - **Overall Structure**: Your manifest shows a well-structured app with a comprehensive set of features, from social media integration to media playback and file sharing. - **Service Configuration**: Marking your services as not exported is a good security practice, minimizing unwanted or harmful interactions from other apps. - **Permissions**: Ensure that each permission requested is genuinely used by the app, as unnecessary permissions can lead to privacy concerns and potentially affect the app's install rate. - **Large Heap Request**: This is typically used for intensive operations, such as high-resolution image processing. Be cautious, as requesting a large heap can affect the device's overall performance. - **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: With FCMService declared, ensure you handle messaging efficiently to enrich the user experience with real-time notifications. - **Compatibility Features**: The manifest includes tools for handling compatibility, like \`tools:replace\`, very useful in resolving manifest merger conflicts. Remember, keeping the manifest well-organized and updated is crucial as it directly impacts the app's functionality, security, and compatibility with various devices and Android versions."},{"prompt":"<?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"utf-8\\"?> <manifest xmlns:android=\\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\\" xmlns:tools=\\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\\">

code snippet you provided is an Android \`AndroidManifest.xml\` file, which defines essential information about your Android application to the Android build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play. Below, I'll outline the key components found in your manifest and briefly touch upon the log message at the end: # Key Components of the Manifest 1. **Permissions:** Your application requests permissions to use the Internet, Camera, Write to External Storage, Read from External Storage, and Run Foreground Services. These permissions allow your app to access various hardware and data on a user's device. 2. **Features:** The application declares usage of camera features but specifies that they are not required. This means your app can be installed on devices without cameras, but it can use the camera if present. 3. **Application:** Contains multiple activities, services, and metadata configurations. It includes: - Custom application class (\`.App\`). - Setup for not allowing backup and enabling hardware acceleration. - A \`FileProvider\` for sharing files between your app and other apps, using a generic file provider path. - Several activities, some with specified screen orientations (mostly portrait), parent activities, and various intents (for launching the app and handling specific URLs or schemes). - Custom services for Firebase Cloud Messaging and player functionalities. These services are not exported, meaning they can not be accessed by other applications. 4. **Metadata:** - Facebook SDK Application ID setup for integrating Facebook SDK features. - Google Play services version. # Log Messages At the end of the snippet, there's what appears to be log messages unrelated to the Android manifest content itself. These are runtime logs, possibly indicating issues or processes during app runtime: - A \`NoNetworkException\` suggesting the app failed a network operation due to no internet connection, which might not be accurate if the internet was indeed available. - Log entries seemingly related to compatibility change reporting and profile installation, indicating system-level operations or diagnostics. # Considerations - Ensure your app properly checks for internet connectivity before attempting network operations to avoid \`NoNetworkException\`. - Remember to request runtime permissions in your code for sensitive permissions like \`CAMERA\`, \`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\`, and \`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\` on Android 6.0 (API level 23) and above. - Make sure to test URL intents thoroughly on different devices to ensure they open your app as expected. - The log entries at the end suggest system-level events that occurred and may not necessarily indicate problems with your app unless related to the issues you're trying to diagnose. Without specific questions or the context of these entries, the recommendations are general best practices when dealing with Android manifests and handling log messages."},{"prompt":"poster about Nicklaus Copernicus Your team will organize into roles.

HISTORICAL HIGHLIGHT Evelyn Boyd Granville Woman shown from shoulders to top of her head Evelyn Boyd Granville Source Evelyn Boyd Granville was the second African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics from an American university. (Martha Euphemia Lofton Haynes was the first in 1890; she became a professor of mathematics.) In the 1950s, Boyd became interested in the new field of computer programming, which led her to the corporation International Business Machines (IBM) in 1956. She programmed in low-level assembly languages and the scientific Fortran language. After IBM, she focused her career on satellite orbits and celestial mechanics. She wrote programs to track the orbits of the Vanguard satellite and the Mercury spacecraft. Later she calculated the trajectories for the Apollo missions. Source CONCLUSION Explain why the study of orbital mechanics is so controversial. What factors contribute to a theory gaining mass acceptance? What impacts did each of the following contributors make on the evolution of orbital mechanics? Nicolaus Copernicus Tycho Brahe Johannes Kepler Robert Hooke Sir Isaac Newton","completion":"Nicolaus Copernicus - Developed the heliocentric model of the universe, where the sun, not the Earth, is at the center of our solar system. - Published his theory in his book \\"De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium\\" in 1543. - Criticism at the time: His theory challenged the geocentric model that had been widely accepted for centuries, causing controversy among religious leaders and astronomers. Critics: - Critic (choose a team member to portray a critic): What evidence did Copernicus have to support his heliocentric model, especially when it went against widely held beliefs at the time? - Nicolaus Copernicus (choose a team member to portray the historical figure): I observed that the movements of the planets could be better explained by a heliocentric model rather than a geocentric one. My theory was based on observations and mathematics, which eventually gained acceptance due to evidence provided by later astronomers. Narrator: - It is the year 1543, a time of great scientific and political change in Europe. The Renaissance is in full swing, challenging old beliefs and opening up new possibilities for scientific inquiry. Moderator: - Copernicus' work laid the foundation for future astronomers like Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Sir Isaac Newton to further develop our understanding of orbital motion theory. His heliocentric model eventually revolutionized the field of astronomy and challenged prevailing beliefs of his time.

Week 1 Title: Course introduction, Introduction to academic research and papers as a graduate student Content: This lecture is the first lecture as thesis writing and research ethics I will introduce the overall lecture and tell you what research and thesis writing means as a graduate student, and what mindset and attitude are desirable. First of all, I would like to introduce the overall lecture 'How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics.' This course is designed to help you prepare and write academic papers efficiently and confidently as a researcher in graduate school. To this end, this lecture covers efficient research, academic paper writing, basic concepts, writing procedures and strategies and various useful information and knowledge that can be carried out without violating research ethics. If you look at the topics of this semester, we're going to talk about various academic journals and databases, the structure of academic papers how to write academic papers, grammar and word choices, and punctuation and finally research ethics and plagiarism. Through this course, you will learn basic content and useful knowledge to prepare and write academic papers efficiently and confidently and you will be able to write your own academic papers efficiently You will also understand research ethics that are essential in the process of research and writing academic papers. In particular, the importance of research ethics and plagiarism has recently emerged and you may have heard news about research irregularities or plagiarism of research papers and works. Research ethics and plagiarism are very important for researchers who constantly conduct research and write numerous works such as papers. Therefore, I hope that this course will help you understand these research ethics issues and be careful and careful in your graduate life and paper writing. Now let's take a look at the composition and schedule of this course. The first lecture, today, is an introduction to the lecture and some tips on how to spend your graduate life to become a good researcher. Second, the next lecture will explain efficient procedures for writing good academic papers especially strategies for planning, organizing preparing, drafting, and making corrections effectively. As a researcher, you're going to write a lot of academic papers, reports, patent documents, and so on throughout your life. Therefore, it will be very beneficial for you to learn efficient processes and strategies for writing documents. The third lecture describes academic papers in the field of science and technology and discusses the selection of targeted journals subject to papers written in their respective fields. In the fourth lecture, we learn about the structure of academic papers, how to tell stories, and how to prepare for academic papers. Lectures from fifth to eighth cover the writing of academic papers in detail. In other words, in the fifth lecture we learn about writing titles, abstracts, and introductions and in the sixth lecture, we learn how to write the subject materials and methods of writing, and how to write the theoretical background. In the next seventh lecture, we will talk about results, discussions, and conclusions and in the eighth lecture, we will talk about writing tables and pictures that are as important as sentences in writing science and technology papers. As the saying goes ‘A picture is worth a thousand words’, the role of photography, illustration, graphs and tables is crucial in the creation of science and technology documents that deal with the delivery of facts, explain and understand certain arguments and guide behavior, making the entire document interesting and not boring. Usually, academic papers are written and reviewed by experts in the field to decide whether to publish them or not. The ninth lecture explains the process of submitting a written paper and being reviewed. Lecture from 10 to 12 cover the additional points needed to write a more complete, interesting, and sophisticated paper In the tenth lecture, we talk about grammar and in the eleventh lecture, we talk about choice of words and punctuation. and in the 12th lecture, you learn about writing styles and paragraphs and writing sentences. In the 13th lecture, you will learn general matters about research ethics and plagiarism which are very important topics in the process of research and paper writing and in the 14th lecture, you will be exposed to considerations when writing a paper through types of plagiarism. Now, to become a great researcher, I'm going to give you some advice on how to do graduate life and research. These are important contents that will help you start your graduate life so please listen carefully and refer to them. First, let's look at the science and engineering that we study and research. According to Wikipedia, science is \\"a system that builds and organizes knowledge about the world we live in in in the form of testable explanations and predictions.\\" Also, according to the American Institute of Engineering, engineering is defined as \\"a system of mathematical and natural science expertise obtained through research, experience, and practice for the purpose of economically utilizing natural materials and power for the benefit of mankind.\\" In particular, in the case of engineering, please pay attention to using for economical application for the benefit of mankind. Therefore, a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and aerospace engineer widely known in aerodynamics Theodore von Karman, left the famous saying, \\"Scientists explain and describe what it is and engineers create something that has never existed before.\\" In this way, analyzing and explaining a phenomenon, object, theory, or explanation that exists, and creating a new object or theory is now the main activity that you're given, research. Throughout your graduate school years, you will learn about these studies and grow up as researchers So, what kind of person is a researcher? As defined by the OECD, \\"A researcher is a person who conducts 'research' a creative work systematically performed to develop knowledge of humans, cultures and societies and to devise new applications, 'research' refers to the activity of confirming facts and previous results solving new or existing problems, or developing a theory.\\" In summary, research is aimed at identifying facts, solving problems, or developing theories and is a systematic and creative activity for this purpose. You're taking the first step in this kind of research. Throughout your graduate school years you will learn about these studies and grow up as researchers. Then, how should you do research in graduate school to become a good researcher? I would like to give you some advice for your successful graduate life so please listen carefully and be familiar with it. First of all, your life as a researcher has already begun today or the moment you decide to go to graduate school. I recommend that you take a postgraduate attitude not just as a student, but as a researcher. If you want to distinguish between your undergraduate life and your graduate life I can tell you that in graduate school, you can learn about research in order to grow as a researcher from the beginning. Next, your tutor is a very important person as your teacher, instructor, colleague, and senior in life. Therefore, meet with your tutor as often as possible and try to understand and learn what kind of person your tutor is and the philosophy you have about education and research. Finally, most professors like enthusiastic, self-directed students. Instead of asking the question like \\"What should I do next?\\" to professor I want you to explain your ideas, plans, designs, or solutions first, and ask, \\"What do you think, professor?\\" Don't forget that no other student is more lovely to professors than students who are trying to think and find answers for themselves. Also, as I said, don't forget that students who don't do anything and spend time without contemplating may look a little frustrated to the professor until they get an answer after saying, \\"What should I do next?\\" I would like to introduce 6 suggestions for research in graduate school to become a good researcher. First, start your research and paper writing as soon as possible, right now. Rather than thinking, 'I'm still not good enough, and I haven't learned enough yet, so I'm not ready to write a paper yet,' it's important to organize what you know now and what you're thinking so far in the form of a dissertation. Second, find and choose a good research question. In fact, one of the most important parts of research and dissertation is research questions and subjects. The selection of research questions for research is very important. Choose important issues in each area, but look for new issues everywhere. In addition, it is necessary to continuously investigate and identify current problems and popular topics in each field so please pay attention to the review paper in the research field. The review paper is a dissertation that contains predictions and suggestions on which direction scholars in each field should conduct research in the future after comprehensively analyzing the latest trends or theories in the field. The review paper organizes various theories and existing research cases in each field by subject so it greatly helps to understand and view the field. Therefore, if you decide on a specific topic or research problem I recommend that you first find and read the review paper for the research topic especially the most recent review paper, if possible. In the review paper, you can view not only recent trends, but history of the past what kind of problems were found and solved in the past what aspects were studied by researchers what the limitations were, and how another researchers made effort to overcome this so how far did the results go In a word, the review paper allows us to look at the progress of research on the subject and research problem until now. At the end of the review paper, the researcher suggests like \\"This is the situation that has been progressed so far so which direction is promising and which direction of research is needed.\\" Those suggestions and arrangements can help you understand your research topic and help you to make decisions about where you'd like your ideas to go in the future. So, I recommend you to find and read the review paper for the relevant field first. The third is a guideline for efficient research. Usually, when we do research, we focus on what the answer is to this problem or to this topic. In fact, before we think about the solution we need to focus on what kind of problem this is what the nature of this problem is why it's difficult and what aspects to look at it. Start your research with \\"Issues, problems\\" instead of \\"Answer, solution.\\" So I encourage you to take enough time to investigate and think about the research topics or research issues that you're interested in first. Also, make sure you have plenty of free time regularly to focus and be creative. For example, go to the lab early in the morning and set a time to focus on your research without interruption from 8 to 10 and practice this. When you start graduate school life, it depends on the lab situation but in most cases, there's a lot going on in the lab. And because there's a lot of research and meetings in the lab with seniors, juniors, and professors you may not have as much time as you think to contemplate what this problem is or focus on what research at your desk. And there may not be as much time as you think to focus on research alone. So, when you go to the lab for the first time and then come out an hour earlier. If the lab usually has meetings or seminars starting at 9 or 10, it'll be 8 or 9 o'clock. You can come out about an hour ago and do your own homework or assignments about what you learn in class or you can use it as a time to reflect on and contemplate the research problem or progress that you're interested in. One more thing, especially in science and engineering For example, if you say,\\"I'm going to have an hour of my time at the lab at 8 o'clock,\\" you should talk to your colleagues or seniors in the lab and get their understanding in advance. Because you work with your colleagues together. For example, \\"I want to have time to concentrate on studying from 8 to 9 tomorrow so please don't interrupt me from 8 to 9.\\" In this way, it would be good to have time to focus on the area of interest by yourself. There's a reason why I keep saying, \\"From 8am or 9am.\\" Of course, you could schedule some time in the evening. For example, if your work ends at 5 or 6 pm, you could say, 'I'll have dinner after work and then I'll have my own time from 7 or 8 pm.' By the way, if you actually do graduate school, there are a lot of things like seminars and meetings at the lab after dinner. Because when you run out of time while working during the day, naturally say \\"Let's do the rest of the work after dinner. Let's do the rest of the work tonight.\\" So if possible, I think it would be good to have personal time in the morning. Of course, you can make a personal schedule late at night, but you need to rest at night. So I recommend that morning is better if possible. And when you do your research, consider when to explore deeper, where to expand wider and what to do separately. You have to focus by properly deciding on various perspectives, scope, and methods of looking at the problem, and in this process you can discuss it with your advisor, senior and research colleagues. Also, when you study a review paper or something about specific area, there is always a 'current state'. You can find a new solution, especially through some challenging questions about the assumptions they have today. For example, suppose an existing paper or solution solves a problem on the assumption that some input is the same. You can think 'Do the inputs have to be the same? What happens when the inputs are different?' Then, you can see why they had to solve the problem through that assumption and if they did without that assumption, what kind of things would happen and what issues would you be able to find and study more. Therefore, if possible, once you've mastered the previously established assumption like 'this problem is up to here from now on' you'll be able to come up with new research and solutions through the process of solving those assumptions and challenging them beyond the assumptions. In addition, some research problems may be simple but complex problems are common in most cases. So, to make it easier to deal with such problems, it would be better to divide the problems into several appropriate parts and solve them. Of course, when you divide one problem into several you can discuss and consult with your professor, colleagues, and seniors to properly share the problem and take charge of the assigned problem. It's also very important to demonstrate your ideas or solutions to other researchers. So it's important to think about how you're going to present your research process or results to others at the same time as you do your research. Also, set your own short-term and long-term research goals to conduct research and actively communicate with other researchers. There's a saying, \\"If you want to be an engineer, cooperate with others.\\" Communicate your research problems, approaches, difficult parts to solve, current results, and future plans with your assistant professor, your colleagues in the lab, and other researchers in the field and think of writing research papers as part of your communication. Don't forget that mutual cooperation among researchers is the basic principle that has been the driving force behind the development of sci-tech. If you think about your research paper as part of your communication it's also very important to be able to explain to others as easily as possible what approach you've applied and what you've achieved rather than explaining the problem with difficulty. In this respect, the fourth advice is to actively publish your research through papers. Always think about which research to publish to which journal. When publishing a paper, make sure that the co-author decides as broad and generous as possible if the person has any contribution, but instead carefully decides the order of the authors. I hope that as many people as possible can cooperate in writing your paper. When writing a paper, make it well organized and readable and interesting , be careful not to use your own terminology, or go against standard notation which is used only in your lab or organization. I also recommend you to include, organize and present enough existing research related to your research explain to your readers the importance of your research topic and the validity of your research methods and publish it in various ways. For example, in addition to publishing papers in academic journals, I hope you will actively publish your research in various forms, such as publishing papers at domestic and foreign academic conferences contributing articles, or writing patent documents. The fifth is about consistency in research. Your field of research has been decided to some extent when you enter graduate school and come to the lab and as you continue to study, you will gradually enter into specific details. Continue to explore, develop and expand your field of study and key research issues. Please study positively, especially in controversial areas. Because controversial areas and issues can be an opportunity for you to make a great achievement in other respects. The last sixth is to cooperate with others. Be good colleagues first and make good colleagues around you. Encourage your colleagues to publish research papers, and if possible, create and operate a cooperative system and a buddy system to efficiently write papers. In particular, a buddy system with lab colleagues who look at each other's papers in the calibration or review of written papers is very effective. In addition, if there is any achievement such as approval for publication of the paper or award celebrate with your colleagues and reward yourself generously. In addition, I hope you will continue to create and maintain an atmosphere and environment around you that supports and helps you with research and paper writing. To maintain this atmosphere and environment, we recommend that you discuss the issues with your colleagues and your advisor, and if necessary, make suggestions to create a comfortable lab environment where you can conduct your research well. Next, I would like to introduce the guidelines for writing academic papers effectively. When writing a paper, do not rush into writing immediately but first think and plan about the subject, scope, and structure of the article plan and organize based on it. Based on this, I hope that you will first create an 'outline' When writing, avoid boring structures, try to explain and express as concisely and clearly as possible and if the reader has been decided, write the paper in a style that the target readers are familiar with and like. You also need to try your best to avoid slang, buzzwords, repeated or euphemistic expressions, spelling and grammar errors. At the end of this lecture, I would like to introduce eight tips for writing and publishing a good paper. First, if you want to write a good paper, read a lot of papers, and if possible, a lot of good papers. In order to expand to a wider range, it is recommended to read papers widely not only in research fields but also in areas other than research fields. Also, be as objective as possible about your research or paper. It is necessary to objectively examine one's research problems, research methods, and results and to view and modify the written paper with the eyes of a third party. Next, you should use good English when writing an English paper and I recommend you to get professional English correction if possible. The fourth is a bit sad, but researchers need to learn to live with \\"rejection.\\" Entire career as a researcher is actually with rejection. However, instead of thinking that the paper is over due to refusal to publish think that you have received good advice from the judges and improve your research and paper. Then you can get good results. Therefore, rejection of sanctions is a painful experience but I hope you think and accept it as a routine process that goes through for good results. In addition, many people often \\"let's write a paper\\" after the study but you should keep in mind how to organize and write a paper not just before the study is over, but throughout the course of the study. In other words, don't forget that if necessary, the process or scope of the study should be determined by considering the writing of the paper. If you want to write a good paper, be a judge yourself. Getting used to how to critically evaluate a study or paper helps you evaluate your research or paper. Also, make sure you decide which journal to submit your paper to as early as possible. By default, look at the goals and scope on the home page of each journal. This allows you to determine what you need to publish your paper in the journal and to shape your research and determine what you need and what results you need. Lastly, if it is a good paper, the quality of the paper is the most important. Try to publish your paper in a good journal as much as possible and continue to challenge yourself to publish your paper in a better journal. This concludes the first lecture on \\"How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics.\\" In this lecture, I introduced the overall lecture and explained what research and paper writing means as a graduate student and what mindset and posture are needed. Thank you for your attention. Week 2 Title: Effective process for writing good academic papers Content: Today is the second lecture on \\"How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics\\" We will learn about effective procedures and processes for writing a good academic paper. I'm going to talk about some excerpts from Susan Stephenson and Steve Whitmore \\"Strategy for Engineering Communication\\", 2002 \\"Science and Technology Communication\\", 2009 which I published with my university professors. If you are more interested in today's lecture, please refer to the two books. So let's talk about effective methods and procedures for writing a good academic paper. In general, academic writing proceeds in stages of \\"planning\\" \\"implementation and preparation\\", \\"drafting\\", and \\"calibration and final editing\\". In the \\"Planning\\" stage, you schedule your thesis define and analyze readers, and set the purpose of your thesis. In fact, I can tell you that one of the most important parts in determining the purpose of the thesis is to define and analyze my purpose, that is, who the reader is to read the paper I write. The \\"Implementation and Preparation\\" step involves devising ideas and preparing for the writing of a paper. In the \\"first draft writing\\" stage, it is necessary to efficiently write the first draft and cope with the obstacles to writing. The \\"Calibration and Final Editing\\" step carefully corrects the draft and checks for grammatical errors and typos. At this stage, an effective response to \\"boring\\" and \\"perfectionism\\" is needed. I will explain in detail later how to deal with the obstacles in writing as well as the boredom and perfectionism that I just mentioned. Academic paper writing is an iterative and recursive process in which three steps continue to be performed interchangeably rather than \\"implementation and preparation\\", \\"drafting\\", and \\"calibration\\" all at once. The table below shows interesting findings. The unskilled author says he spends about 50% of his entire paper writing time \\"implementing and preparing\\" and 45% of the rest \\"drafting\\" and only about 5% of his time during the final \\"calibration\\" phase. There is a high risk that the overall completeness of the paper will not be high because only a small amount of time is devoted to the \\"calibration\\" stage of increasing the completeness of the paper through final finishing. If you look at this part, if you have 10 days to write a paper you think about how to write a paper for about 5 days and spend the remaining 4 and a half days writing and then you have only half a day. It means the first draft was made in the part where you just finished the paper for half a day and submitted. And there are many cases where it is submitted without sufficient review or revision. When you actually write it like this, it's just as time-consuming as you can imagine. 50% of the time without writing, but as the deadline is near, they write a draft and even write proofreading and submit it. As a result, not only is the overall writing process inefficient but the end result is not refined to such a high level. It's a general story. On the other hand, experienced authors spend about 25% of their total paper writing time on \\"implementation and preparation\\" 35% on \\"drafting\\" stage, and the remaining 40% on the final \\"calibration\\" stage. Because sufficient time is spent on calibration and finishing the final completion of the paper can be improved. Spending only 25% of the time on the \\"Imagine and Prepare\\" stage also means that you are constantly devising ideas for your thesis. So, in a way, researchers who are good at writing papers keep thinking 'what to do with the thesis' and 'how to write the thesis in which journal when the results come out' even in the process of continuing research in their heads. When he thinks 'Let's write a thesis', he can quickly complete a draft and then spend enough time to revise it meticulously, although he can do it alone but with his colleagues in multiple stages of revision. To exaggerate a little bit, students who write papers uncomfortable and inefficient usually don't think much about papers, but when they say, \\"Let's write a paper now,\\" but only then, they think \\"What paper should I write?\\" so It takes a lot of time to think and prepare and after they write a draft they don't have a few days to refine and revise it. This means that the quality of the thesis is not high. In other words, it is advisable to spend your time writing your paper as quickly as possible in the front and maximizing the completion of your paper in the back. Let's take a closer look at each paper writing step. First stage is \\"planning\\". A successful paper writer initiates a plan as quickly as possible starting as soon as he decides to write the paper dividing it into as many tasks as possible and starting the main tasks for writing the paper before completing the study. As I said, even in the course of his research, for example if he thinks \\"I have to put this graph in this form\\", it means that he'll keep that graph in advance. In addition, for good thesis writing, ask and identify who the \\"reader\\" of the paper and clarify the \\"purpose\\" of the paper to be written. When writing a paper, it is very important to set the \\"reader\\" and \\"purpose\\" of the article. You can more accurately determine the \\"purpose\\" of the paper by identifying who the \\"readers\\" of the paper are their expertise, their understanding of the subject, and their likes in advance. This page shows the questions used for \\"Reader\\" analysis. Who will read your writing? Are they a technical expert, manager, or businessman? And why do they read your papers? Why did they ask you to write a paper? If, when readers see the paper you have written, they will be interested in seeing the title or abstract of the paper, so what part will they be interested in? What actions do they take based on your paper? What information did they ask for? Are their instructions clear? Or do they need confirmation? How well do readers know about the topic? And how much background knowledge and information do they need? Are your readers familiar with the technical terms you use? What information do readers need? Do you have all the information they need to address their needs? If not I would like to emphasize thatwhat should you look for in what form and what contents should be organized and presented , what contents should be put in and what contents should be left out, etc. These things are determined according to what parts the readers will be curious about and need while reading the thesis you wrote. The following shows the questions used in the process of determining the \\"purpose\\" of the paper. What do you want to gain from this paper? Can you clearly and concisely describe the purpose of the paper? How does the goal of the paper relate to readers' expectations? Do readers share your goals? If not, what is the discrepancy? How can you meet both your goals and your readers' expectations? How do you know what your readers know and what they don't know? What attitudes or values should be considered in the paper? Rather than answering each question as a test I think it's good to use it as a guideline for analyzing readers and determining their goals by looking through these questions like a checklist. In addition, it is recommended to prepare and secure a good writing environment at the \\"planning\\" stage. Last lecture, I told you to create a quiet, focused time for yourself in the lab, and the same goes for writing. If you're writing and there's any other disturbance around you it's already difficult to write, so it won't be easy. Create your own writing environment where you can be quiet, uninterrupted, and non-disruptive. At this time, pay attention to the lighting and improve physical comfort. It's a general story, but when it's noisy around you when you're writing, it's hard to concentrate on writing. Because writing itself is not a very pleasant act. For most people, writing is painful, and they don't want to do it. So if you're already doing something that's not pleasant, but you're interrupted you can't see it well, nosiy around you, then it's very difficult to write. So when you write, you need an environment where you can write comfortably without being disturbed. Many researchers I know, including myself, have their own environment. Some people like to go to a coffee shop and sit quietly and write some people like to be quiet in the library's reading room and some people like to do it while listening to music at their desks. This means that you should try to find an environment where you can improve the efficiency of your own comfortable writing, and continue to maintain and organize that environment. It's not the same for everyone, but I want to tell you to find and create your own writing-friendly environment. It is also recommended to improve the usability of the computers and software used in writing the paper. Learn how to use word processors that are often used when writing papers and various software that is used to create pictures and tables. If you need to write a paper in a specific work environment quickly identify the devices or programs in that environment and familiarize yourself with how to use them. The second step in writing a paper for efficient academic writing is \\"implementation and preparation.\\" In the \\"Implementation and Preparation\\" stage, the topics and contents to be covered in the paper are organized and arranged. Outline, Outlining is one of the most common strategies used to organize content during academic writing to show the overall flow. You're looking at Microsoft MS Word's overview feature as an example. Graphics are sometimes used to organize various topics and contents and mind mapping shown on this page is one of the representative methods. Mind mapping is useful for organizing various topics and contents when devising a paper in a way that generates and visually organizes ideas by showing the relationship between ideas as you see. One of the ways to use graphics to organize different topics and content is the Taxonomizing classification method. This method is a strategy that visually organizes and groups various ideas based on common characteristics, as shown in the example. In thesis writing, logical order and pattern are used to organize ideas and content. Common patterns in academic papers include chronology of processes in chronological order of events spatial order of objects in physical relationships 'Comparison/Contrast' that similarities and differences between existing and new designs 'Order of importance' that from important to less important 'Problem solving' that explanation of problem, solutions and recommendations. 'General to specific' that explains the general point and then follows a more detailed explanation or special example. The use of these widely known patterns in organization not only helps readers follow the logical flow as a whole but also helps readers to understand and remember the content for a long time. I think you're most familiar with the order of time and space. In the case of chronology, for example, when explaining the history of usually related research there were studies like this in the 1960s, there were studies like this in the 70s there were studies like this in the 80s. It's very natural to describe it in chronological order like this. Physically, for example, if you often explain a schedule or journey it would be better to explain it from Seoul to Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan based on Korean standards. Rather than explaining Seoul, Busan, Daejeon, Daegu and back and forth, explaining in order that readers are familiar with and know the following in accordance with the logical order and pattern of science and technology. The third step in writing a paper for efficient academic writing is \\"Drafting.\\" In general, there are four ways to \\"Drafting.\\" That is, there is a way to combine planning and preparation drafting, and proofreading and proceeding at the same time. There is a way to separate the conception and preparation, draft preparation, and calibration. And there is a way to plan, prepare, draft together, and then calibrate afterwards. There is a way to plan and prepare first, and then draft and calibrate together. It is known that the shorter the volume of papers the more effective it is to combine conception, preparation, draft, and proofreading and the longer the volume, the more effective it is to separate conception, preparation, draft, and proofreading. In general, 5-15 page paper submitted to an academic conference or journal is most effective in developing, preparing and drafting together, and then calibrating. Now let's compare the pros and cons of each draft method. First, it is a combination of planning and preparation, drafting and proofreading. This method makes it easy to write down points and sentences even if you don’t have clear idea of how to write. Thus you can start writing right away, which is especially advantageous when there is no clear solution to a particular problem. If you typically have a hard time starting out it's a great way to start writing a dissertation because you show a high level of creativity and your writing is relatively free. The following is how to proceed separately by classifying conception and preparation, drafting, and proofreading. In this method, the content, format and organization of the paper are initially carefully planned and then each section is written as quickly as possible. Finally, multiple intensive complete corrections are performed. This method is typically applied to writing long documents such as user manuals or textbooks. The following is a method that is generally known to be most suitable for writing a thesis proceeds with conception and preparation and drafting, followed by proofreading. Remember to leave enough time for proofreading as this method combines conception and preparation with drafting first proceeding with proofreading. Especially with this method, maintaining writing momentum is paramount and once you start writing your first draft you shouldn't stop writing until you've finished your first draft. So, if you run into problems with conception and preparation or drafting don't waste time solving them, just mark them and move on. I can tell you that the important thing in drafting is to complete the draft from start to finish without losing your writing momentum. A draft is just a draft. This is possible because we leave plenty of proofreading time behind so we have plenty of time to take it and revise it to a high level once the draft is complete. This is an effective method for relatively short documents typically between 5 and 15 pages, or for single sections within longer documents. In this method, the act of writing a thesis itself is a clue to new ideas, new approaches to the problem at hand, and new solutions to the problem. In addition, even if the degree of completion is very low you can get some satisfaction because the first draft is completed and you can expand the thesis with more time because you spent less time and effort on writing the first draft. In this method, it is essential to have an undisturbed environment to maintain writing momentum and it is important to have ample creative breaks between conception and preparation and drafting and proofreading. Creative break refers to the time to take a break from the thesis writing work and give your mind and brain a rest. Through creative break, you can be more creative and motivated and also objectively and meticulously carry out proofreading work. After a creative break, even the papers you've been writing look different and come up with new ideas you hadn't thought of before. When you have 10 days, invest about 5 days at first or 5 days and half a day to come up with an idea collect various data, and then concentrate on writing a draft. In the process of writing a draft, if possible do not take a break, and make a finished copy. Once the draft is complete, you must be tired as writing drafts without a break. So you need taking a break for about half a day. When you take a break, you forget about writing drafts and listen to music, watch movies or simply take a break. When you take a break for half a day or a day through these breaks and then look at the draft you wrote next, you're like 'Huh? Why did I write this?' You can see a completely different side of what you do and you can fill in the wrong parts of the parts you wrote previously or the parts you left blank because you didn't come up with an idea when writing the original draft. That will be the positive effect of creative break. A word of caution, in my experience, creative breaks are all good but I don't think they're as effective if you're drinking or doing something that's completely disorienting. I recommend that you take a creative break with the finished draft in your hand or put it on a USB stick in your pocket and have a relaxing time watching a movie or going to a coffee house for a good coffee or food. The last method is to proceed with conception and preparation first and then proceed with drafting and proofreading in parallel. This method works well for longer documents, like 15 to 50 pages or when word choice needs to be very precise such as proposals, patents, or legal documents. Organization is very important in this method, otherwise when you pause in the proofreading process, it will be difficult to recall what needs to come next. Instead, reviewing the first few paragraphs will help you overcome your writing hurdles as the next idea will often come from what you've written up to that point. The key to drafting is to keep the momentum going and not stop writing. The writing barriers that are often encountered when writing a dissertation are related to planning caused by environmental factors, related to the subject, caused by words caused by form, related to readers, and caused by expectations and risks. Overcoming these obstacles through thorough preparation and strategic response is necessary for successful draft writing and efficient paper writing and competent authors are those who know how to deal with these obstacles. The fourth and final stage of the thesis writing for efficient academic thesis writing is “proofreading and final completion”. Proofreading is the most important process to remove errors in research papers increase reliability, and reconsider completeness. Since a meticulous and complete proofreading can take a significant amount of time it is important to allow sufficient time for proofreading during the initial planning phase. Also, it is not an easy task to review and revise your thesis several times from an objective point of view so it is recommended to take a creative break before proofreading. During proofreading, it is important to read the paper objectively and critically. Proofreading is carried out at several levels and aspects including content organization, persuasive emphasis format, rules, paragraph organization, sentence structure and word choice. When looking at a strategy to make calibration effective it is difficult to look at all aspects at once, so it is best to do it in multiple rounds. What I mean is, first of all, take a look at it to see if the flow of the article as a whole is okay. At that time, even if there are errors, they are ignored. The second one meticulously checks if the words are okay and the third one checks the misspellings. In this way, it can be said that the aspect of correcting several times while looking at one aspect as a whole is more effective. Rather than looking at a computer screen and proceeding, there are many cases that proceed with printing on paper. This will be a personal preference. It's fine if you say 'I prefer to do it on a computer screen' but in general if you print it out on paper, you can hold the paper and look at the front and back as well as freely take notes so printing out on paper and proceeding is still generally recommended. Since you are a generation that is especially more digitally familiar, it would be okay to just look at the computer screen and proceed as soon as you feel comfortable. I also sometimes find errors by reading them out loud. Strangely enough, things like typos and errors that were not found with the naked eye make sounds and this is called 'reading correction'. It stands out when read aloud. So you need to try something like this. To review the overall flow of the thesis, it is effective to check the outline of the document and make a list of recurring issues so that the review proceeds without omission. In general, it is recommended that you proofread an academic thesis 4 or 5 times by yourself and 2 or 3 times by a third party, a total of 7 or 8 times. In the case of proofreading by a third party, it is best to find and request a person who will later become a reader of the thesis and it is also recommended to organize and operate a buddy system with your graduate school colleagues to proofread each other's thesis. Graduate laboratory colleagues are not only colleagues in research but can also be helpful buddies in the process of writing a dissertation. In addition, it is a good way to rewrite the introductory part to check whether the thesis was written well as a whole. It can be said that perfectionism and boredom make proofreading for the completion of an academic thesis difficult. First of all, perfectionism helps to write a good thesis, but if it is excessive it makes the proofreading work infinitely longer and reduces the efficiency. To overcome perfectionism, it's a good idea to start by setting clear limits on the time and energy you can devote to proofreading and final editing. In addition, it is better to focus more on high-level proofreading such as the overall flow of the text and balance of chapters and verses, and the correction of missing or unnecessary content rather than low-level editing such as typos and spelling errors. This is because many of the low-level editing tasks are usually solved automatically by the word processor and can be processed mechanically by professional editors at the publishing house once the paper is confirmed for publication. Therefore, what you really need to focus on in proofreading is 'Was this thesis well written?', 'The flow of the composition, whether all the contents are included' 'Is the order okay', 'Is the balance right', etc. In addition, after publishing the paper, it is very helpful for future work to clearly understand the reader's reaction to the paper you wrote and to draw and analyze the difference between what you thought and expected when writing the paper and the actual reaction of the readers. To overcome the excruciating boredom of proofreading, it's a good idea to increase the difficulty of the task at hand by focusing on the more complex parts. In other words, it is not simple editing work to choose the right words but the high-level consideration and effort to think about which words can meet the expectations of the reader makes the proofreading work not boring. Also, list the interesting tasks first and do the more interesting ones later. In addition, it is recommended to clearly admit that proofreading itself is not interesting and to set up a system such as a checklist so that you can pay attention to the proofreading process again when you lose concentration due to boredom. As mentioned above, this time, we studied the effective procedural process for writing a good academic thesis. Thank you for your attention. Week 3 Title: Academic Papers in Science and Engineering, Selecting a Target Journal for Your Academic Manuscript Content: Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from Energy Science Department who is in charge of lecture three to six in Academic Writing and Research Ethics. From lecture three to six that I'm in charge of, I think I'll be talking a little bit more about the writing techniques of the paper. To start with lecture three, Academic Papers are completely different from the textbooks you've studied so far. So you have to think, describe, or write something completely different from the scientific facts and research methods that you usually see in your text books. I'm going to talk a lot about those things. In lecture three, let's have a time to think about which journals you're writing your papers in, and which journals you're researching will be published in, so many people will read them. First of all, let's get started and think about what papers are and what theses are. You usually consider them as academic papers. There are a lot of technical descriptions and reports, but the papers are different from those, and it's the papers that demands scientific technology and we see a lot of it in academia. Let me tell you how to write about such papers in science and engineering and what should we think about. Firstly, not all professors think the same because this course is delivered by many professors. Many professors write different papers, so all professors have different ideas. In other words, professors and students are individual people, so they all have different thoughts. There may be technical aspects in common, but the Academic Paper is a thing to write with many considerations?for example, which readers are going to read it or how readers will think about it?as paper itself is a series of conversations between individuals. Therefore, it has to be completely different from the books and textbooks that you've studied so far. Basically, writing a paper is very difficult. The reason is that you have to think about what kind of readers will read, and when they read it, you have to be able to let them understand exactly what you think based on scientific facts. If you've ever written a paper or have a chance to do so, I'm sure you'll have a very burdensome and painful time as you can see in the cartoon. I'll tell you why you felt like this and why this is more fun than pain. As you can see in the cartoon up there, a student is thinking that she wishes to show her thoughts on the screen right away. So do I. I also have a lot of time to think about how to describe what's important, and how to convey my thoughts when I talk to many readers. During those times, your hands don't go straight to the keyboard. I have to write it, but it's very hard. So I keep thinking - let's write it, how should we write it, write it, I spend a lot of time like this. And then it's painful, usually. Because it's difficult, you can think of it as a natural process, which may not be such a big challenge in reality. Starting today, from lecture three to six, I'm going to tell you why. Another case is the cartoon that you see below, where a professor corrected the paper written by a student. The student saw it and said, \\"You fixed all of this.\\" The professor didn’t fix just a word or a grammar, but he fixed everything instead. He fixed the whole paper. And the professor says that it is easier to write a whole paper than fix or comment just a part. There are very important points in here. In fact, the papers that you write about the research from the beginning?let me rephrase that you read. The research papers that you read are written in one story from beginning to end. But the written story is an individual's idea. In other words, it contains the thoughts you are writing and the thoughts of the co-researchers who worked with you on the paper. As each person’s different ideas becomes one paper, when one person starts writing, the person's thoughts are contained from beginning to end. So there could be some errors that you thought of. If you correct one error, it's much easier to correct the whole paper because it's not just one error, but because you have to express the person's thoughts from beginning to end. In fact, even if I fix 10 to 20 pages of paper that my students bring, when I go through each word and sentence several time, and I think, \\"Why did I fix this?\\" or \\"Why did I say this?\\" So I have another period to fix the whole thing. Then, as shown in the cartoon, a student got the fixed part and wrote it again, and if the student show it to the professor again, he will fix it all over again. And he’ll give it back again. So this cycle lasts forever, to be honest. And before you say okay, even if you say okay, it's hard to submit until the professor or co-researchers says okay. But one of the most important things about the process is how well your thoughts are reflected, and how consistent they are from beginning to end. Through this process of writing dozens or hundreds of papers, you will be improved. That might happen, but at first, writing a paper after just reading it will be quite difficult. So I'd like to talk about those things together and tell you that it's not just that difficult. As I said in the introduction at the beginning, writing a paper is communication with many people; for example, how readers will read this, or even before them, we communicate with many researchers and editors of the paper. In the way of communication, as there are many ways of communicating between people, even if you are alone, other people have their own thoughts, so there are always different reactions. I'll tell you a few of the reactions, and let you know that you don't have to struggle with them. For this example, I wrote a paper and submitted. Fortunately, I passed the editor?I'll tell you later about the process of submitting the paper and how the paper is made?and went into the review process. This is the content of referee in review process. This paper reports this, this, and this on a subject. And there’s interesting results. Those results are first, second; the editor summarized like this. Making summary like this perhaps this referee read the paper really hard. Or the referee might just read the abstract that you wrote and organize it like that. I mean, you don't have to believe everything that referee has written down. Because from the perspective of those who have been researching or writing for a long time, those two, three or four points that you think are important can be picked up very easily just by reading the abstract. So the referee said that those results were very interesting. These results, however, are not significant at all and do not have enough novelty to be published in Nature or Nature journals. Then what are those wordings? It is fun, but cannot be published. This might let you down. Why they say no, even though it is fun? So what I’m going to say from now is that we need to read the thoughts of the people who are expressing like this. The expression says: the results of your research are interesting, but there's not enough significance for your papers to be published in Nature or Nature Research journal. That's never a very negative view of your abilities or your research results. So you never have to take that person's idea as it is in the review points. The referee says that it is fun but not enough, that is, however, an individual’s idea. Saying not enough doesn't determine the value of your research results. That's why I can agree or disagree with this individual's referee. Most of times people don’t agree. Because it's normal not to agree if someone else sees your research and thinks it's bad. If you agree there, you may have been wrong when you wrote your research paper. So we talk again without agreeing. We communicate. In this paper, we actually did somethings, but we might have given some misunderstanding. Then we might say we'll write it again to make the point, and then we’ll go to the revision process again. Let me see another example. Similar content is described here. If you look at the first line, very detailed experimental data are provided and presented, and made something about it. This work is very interesting to talk about. It is interesting and well organized. Well organized is not easy to hear, but it feels great to hear it. Because there's a time when you have to write the paper well from beginning to end, and it means you did a good job. But it states that despite doing well, the of the work is not sufficient to warrant its publication in high quality journal like Nature. Publication in high impact journals like Nature Science may be difficult, but I’m telling you again that it doesn't mean that your findings are very bad, as I said earlier. The expression, “not sufficient to warrant its publication” is just an idea of that referee. If this referee thought like that, he would make suggestion to contribute a lower-level paper. That's how we normally suggest. You get suggestion, then you read the paper again, but you might admit the idea; so basically, other people get to see your paper again. Then, before we go through it, we can identify that there may be some misunderstandings, so the referee may not have been able to pinpoint our research. This is because that the referee says that “the work is interesting and the paper is well organized. There is no reason describes why it is not worth publishing. Then the referee who reviewed this paper may not read your research paper thoroughly. You might notice in the first sentence that the referee didn't read it thoroughly without talking. There are two ways that you can do after you knew it. “Yeah, I'll give up.” or “Since you didn't read it hard, I want to talk again and change your mind.” In my case, I always choose the second option. I always talk them again. After discussing about it again, I give up when I really can't, and I publish it in another journal. It takes a very long time for people to communicate with others with different thoughts before rejected and accepted by other journals. So, it is very important to you know how to organize your thoughts with professors and co-researchers and accurately convey them to others and tell them exactly why this research is better research and scientifically valuable. That's why you need to know that this is what a paper is about when it comes to communicating with so many people. As you can see while searching on the internet, there are so many journals and papers that are always published. So let me tell you about the process of choosing papers and journals, and why and which you should choose. Those papers are classified in Creative Analytics of Web of Science by their fields and levels, and you can easily organize your findings and why this paper should fit in certain fields. You've probably heard of SCI a lot. Scientific papers, including engineering and basic science, usually fall into SCI or SCIE; social science into SSCI; and art or humanity into AHCI. There is a process in which you look around what papers belong to each classification and contribute to them. In the process of making the publication, the first way you can categorize is by a parameter called impact factor. This impact factor can be a very important tool for you to decide which paper to publish to. If you think the research paper is really great, you'll choose a journal with a very high impact factor, but if you think this is important in this field, but it's not urgent, and everyone else is showing this much, you'll choose a journal with less impact factor. You can choose it by yourself or with your co-researchers; for example, if you think carefully about what impact factor tells you, you'll know why. The number of impact factors determines the level of the paper. The way to determine the level of the paper can be easily seen here by how to calculate the impact factor. It can be determined by the proportion of the number of papers that have become public in journal for two years and how many are quoted in two years. The impact factor is high if the number of papers is small and the citation number is large; in other words, other researchers cited a lot of papers in this journal whether the result is good or bad. Because one may not quote, a lot of quotes mean that so many researchers have read them, including those who did not quote and those who did. Saying many people can read it is that many people might think that the research results are important. So you might be studying with those high impact journals. That's why many people publish papers while enduring the painful times hoping they can be read my many people, not by few people. Usually, based on the impact factor, one hopes that the paper that he or she is writing now will be read by a certain number of people, but the scope is broad in each field, so it really depends. So in choosing a journal, first you choose whether it will be read by a lot of people and consider the importance of the research results of your own paper. In fact, if you search for certain papers, you're using Google Scholar a lot these days. If you use Google Scholar, the first parameter to be seen with the paper is how much the paper was quoted. In some papers, the values are always presented as you can see here. Contents of the paper is hard to find. However, along with the paper’s title, it shows how many times it has been quoted. It may be a paper from one person, but it always says the number of quotes under the title in Google Scholar. It's important how many quotes have been made. Because the number of people read it determines importance of the research results. So usually there's always a lot of quotes from Science and Nature Physics, very high-level journals that you know. That's why we want to publish a lot to journals with high impact factors. Rather than wanting to have a high impact factor journal, because of the process that research results are acknowledged by many people through communication and use them again, we want to publish them in this high impact journal with high citation. Then you'll always have a question like, \\"Are we going to post only high-level journals?\\" In fact, it's a very difficult task, so you need to make good decisions on the papers you write. So I'll tell you briefly about the ways to decide. Each person has a different personality, so if you ask me, I always pursue a high impact factor. I always pursue a high impact factor, some of my papers go through many failures, and they even publish in low impact factor journals. If you ask me about why you're trying so hard to publish such a high impact factor while taking so much time, you have to think which journal to publish. Because we have a purpose to publish a paper. And the purpose is because we want it to be read a lot. We want it to be read a lot, so we’ll want a high factor, too. The high impact factor is actually publishing in a short time. There are many cases where the high impact factor becomes public in a short time rather than the low impact factor because of the desire to show the results of my research to the world in a short time. Because it's always competitive with many other researchers. This competition is also difficult, but it is very important that I win this competition and contribute my good research results to a good research journal, and publish it. Then there are some points that you need to think about when you decide on a paper. You must first increase visibility. Because you're researchers, you are shown by people when showing your good research results to many people. In order to improve this, we also decide on a paper. And we want to save time and effort like here. If you start to publish with high impact factor, it's highly likely that many of their papers will be rejected. Then the time will be re-involved, and since the paper will not be submitted in the same format, additional efforts will be made to revise it again. So if you consider these times to communicate with people until publishing, you might want to save those time. And the other is that you may experience a lot of situations that the research papers that you submitted are not publishing, but rejected. You choose the most appropriate papers to reduce these things. So usually, I think about a few things. The first thing you should think about when choosing your paper is what research you are doing and what journals you are reading. The journals you're reading are similar to your researches, and you're probably reading a lot of papers to study them. So it's usually normal to publish to the papers you're reading. Then it's very likely to be high-level journals because you're learning and studying. So there's always a question of whether you're going to start with a high level, but you can decide some candidates for several journals. About the studies that you're studying in personally. Then there's a reason why you have to choose one. For example, Nature, Science, and others have different fields, such as Nature Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials. If you think of four magazines like this, Nature and Science, which have high impact, are interdisciplinary, so there are a lot of broad scopes in the papers. There's bio, materials, and chemistry. Physics and geology, too. It shows all the papers in a very wide field. So you can choose Nature Science first. But you might think that scope is a little specific and a little narrow. If you studied nano, you choose Nanotechnolgy, rather than Nature. Or you can choose Advanced Materials if you write about materials, but the first thing you need to do when choosing the candidates is to read the scopes of the paper. Because some papers have scopes that they want in their journals. But the paper that doesn't fit with the scope, for example, you studied nanomaterials, and you studied photonics with that nanomaterials. Because it's a nanomaterial, you can either go to Nature Nanotechnology or Nature Photonics. But if you think about what significance is most important to your research, the journal that fits the scope can be Nanotechnology or Photonics. Just like that, it's very important that you always think about the scope of the journal and make a decision. Then we send it. Then the response of the journal comes, and when it is published, you can see whether you have chosen the right journal or not. There are a few things that you need to worry about during this long time, but these things are very technical, so I'll keep telling you later. So I also try my best to write a good paper like you, but I'll tell you the first the way to save time. To save the time, the usual methods may not be to write out quickly and post quickly. The reason each journal has an editor is because he or she is thinking about whether to send a review or not. From my experience, it usually takes about a day, 24 hours, or a month at the most. So there's one way to reduce this period very much and move on quickly. I don't think a lot of people did, but I would like to recommend you to do it since you were a student, and the thing is to send a paper to this journal first before I submit it. Only to editor. Send it to the editor and tell him or her that my paper has this amount of significance and there’s a reason to be publicize in this magazine. It doesn't matter because it's my idea. 그 사람들은, 에디터들은 받아들일 수도 있고요 무시할 수도 있고요. move on to the next step. If you communicate with editors first to shorten the process and get good results and go over the review process, for my personal experience, it is more likely that your research would be a paper. So it's not a bad idea to always do pre submission's inquiry and it's the best way to save time. So I'll talk about the technical parts, such as the process of choosing a paper in more detail in the next chapter. Week 4 Title: Structure of an academic paper Storytelling method for academic papers Preparing for writing academic papers Content: This is the fourth lecture on ‘Academic Writing and Research Ethics 1’ In this class, I will tell you how the structure of the academic paper is organized, how to communicate with many people as I said in the round of three, and how to prepare for good writing. First, the structure of the paper. If you look at the papers that you are studying a lot, the composition of each paper is slightly different. However, the basic composition is set, so you can think of it as a slightly modified form of each thesis in that set rule. From the high-impact journals to the low-impact journals which you choose, the scopes of all the papers may be different and composition may be different. The other is that the composition is different depending on what paper it is, so I'll look at this composition and talk about the important things in each composition. I'm going to quickly turn over the slides. First, it's the title. After the title, as you always know, they are the authors. There are authors, and the first sentence that comes out is Abstract, there are sentences of abstract. When the abstract is finished, the introduction usually begins. Materials and methods usually go in or out after introduction. Because each journal might have these materials and methods at the end. And it's also published in other files like other surfman process. In addition, after the introduction and the conversation about methods and materials, the most important results and discussions are always coming out. These results and discuses come in one section in a barrel, and they come out separated. You can decide how to write, but you can also write according to the way you are targeting journals. And when it comes out like that, composition isn't just consist of only writing, but as you all know, writing is shown in figures, and you're talking about the results of your research showing table that is organized. The other is that when this is done, there are usually acknowledgements that say, \\"How this paper was executed with some help,\\" and references that say, \\"This paper cited other papers and what papers are quoted and where they are described. That's how the papers are divided into sections of about 10 and as little as six. Each of these parts has many points that you need to think about. I'm going to try to talk to you based on your experiences. If you think about what to read first when you read the paper, the degree of significance will be determined. As always, most read the title first. Most read the title first. The author won't read first to read. Perhaps there is an effort to find the professor's thesis only to read the research papers of the very good professors. Then you can look for authors first. But we usually start with the title. If you look at the title, it can be very simple and difficult to say. The title should contain ‘what thoughts you have and what research results you have written’ and ‘what is the most important thing’. It's hard, right? Yes, the title is very difficult. I think writing a title is the most difficult part than writing a certain part. Me, too. That's why I'm always thinking about the title until the moment I submit my thesis. Because this can determine everything, we always consider the title as our top priority, even during the ex-premature that we're always writing papers, in the middle of the section, and in finishing step that we're writing the conclusion, always I'm thinking about the title. Most people think a lot about whether this title is appropriate or not, and whether this title attract a lot of people's attention. And through this thinking, most people write title. Then, we write authors, which is basically very technical, so if you write your own papers, it will be natural for you to become host authors, and your supervisors or co-research professors will be registered as corresponding authors. Everyone knows these parts, so let's skip them. The next important thing is that when the title is decided, which covers all with some limited wording, and the reader who read the title usually only reads abstract. They read abstract first. When they read abstract first, as I said in the third class, this abstract is very important so that you can understand that the reviewers only read abstract or read the whole thing well during communicating with reviewers. Because with about 10 words or 15 words that I said in the title, you're going to spread them out into 100 or 250 words. The abstract, which contains why it's important, what you've studied, what the results are so important to this society that what these results mean, is the most important part of your entire paper that follows the title. And you would write whole thing which the abstract contains with being limited, and elaborate on these things, that is the question of why the introduction did this research, why the introduction had to do it with the references, background and literacy, and why they had to do it, and what is promo definition and raising questions you would present, what is problems, or what new ideas I was trying to use. So introduction is also important. Then, the introduction is then written about three to five times as long as the usual abstract. And there are materials methods section. So there are parts that is how you go about doing some research, for example, how you analysis with some material and ingredients and how you interpret some results in some way. Maybe it's important right now. I'd yet rather awkward because title is also important and I said, abstract is also important and all important. The reasons why they are contained and contents of each part are all different, so everything has to be important. You'll spend a lot of time on the result part. For example, the part of the result, when you show the result, the first way you can show the result well is to show pictures, graphs, and tables. Yes, that's right. In my experience, the reason I'm telling you about my experience is because each person has different ways of looking at each paper, choosing a paper, and studying, so when I read paper, I read first the title and abstract, and basically understand what research this paper did and what results it has. If I decide whether there is paper's worth, that I take the time to read this research pape, or not, I go to the result section first and I look at the picture first. And I look at the table first. I will first look at how the results of the study were measured and what data are there. And the data that I saw, when the detailed data came out, when it caught my attention, I read the sentences that were described in the result section. So in this result, to make you read to a lot of readers, you'll have to make sure that you can clearly see the good pictures and detailed data. In addition to writing a paper in English, efforts are also made to show the data well, so the period of writing this result part is very long and requires a lot of hard work. Then, you have to think about how to show the results and how to develop them. Here are some rules that show, and the most important of them is number one. You can think that number 1 is deciding everything. As you can see in this number one, how clearly you are using tables, pictures and graphs to illustrate your results, and figure is not usually just one in the paper, but at least three, as many as you can decide, but there can be a lot of pictures. Whether you show first most important data and what basic data you're going to show, or how to start with the most important part and show the data you support later. And about this logic, how to unfold the logic in your paper which you think and imagine. And when you're explaining that logic, it is important to show it very clearly. If your logic is a little tangled during the screening and while communicating with others, people think, \\"Oh, I don't want to communicate anymore.\\" The, there's a possibility that reviewers and referees will give you reject. Or because the paper is well organized and not well written, they are 'Write the paper again and send another reject or order to revise again. Therefore, it is very important to make it easy for others to understand what content is said and how it is said. And, for example, like writing in the fourth part, a unnecessary data are not needed. Because it's really unnecessary to paint unnecessary data and brag, \\"Oh, I've worked hard on research and there's a lot of data.\\" If you put that unnecessary thing in, this logic will be broken and maybe the clearance will fall. Then, people, who read and wirte paper and read written paper, feel very difficult to read that paper, and if they think 'it's difficult', there is a process that many people don't read again and don't quote. Then, the quality of the paper can be reduced. Therefore, it is important to avoid presenting unnecessary data that does not fit logic and is not clear. It's the discus part, and the way I usually write a paper is to talk about results and discusions together. I shows the data and discuses why the meaning of the data is important. The word \\"discussion\\" means, I write, but other people will read, judge and think about the importance. Then they'll think about whether it's right or wrong. Readers. That's why we call it a discussion. It's important to tell them why it's important. Then, because you have a lot of data, you will always try to talk what parts are important. But people who read the papaer, like the readers, reviewers and referees, want to know first what is most importan. Because they should figure out what most important is, you have the duty to highlight the most important part for them. And you would talk why you do many these studies, why you give a lot data and then you would say logically what word is the most important by using them. What you think. So, while communicating with others, if you think about putting importance on top and bottom, as I said in the previous chapter, how to decorate the result will be decided. Logically. Based on that logic, your wordings will be decided. It's decided which points you're going to clear up the most, and the title will contain the main concept, which you're going to call main claim. About how appropriate it is to be in the title,your ideas will get into discussion and into the process, that is your ideas will convince others. In this persuasive part of discussion, if logic is twisted and the result is a little bit out of order, it's hard to convey these parts correctly. That's why it's very important to write it logically and clearly, and to show only the data that you really need, not unnecessarily. And tables and graphs. I know that it takes a lot of effort. It's hard. But most of all, there are processes where you have to look at it several times and fix it many times, technically and without mistakes. Because the tables, graphs, or figures contained in this are the determination of your real effort to simplify the data and content you've gained during the time you've spent writing the paper, and perhaps, this graph is more important than the English sentence you've described. Let's think this once. There is a textbook that you see and study. In the textbook, there are many paintings. Where did those emerge? Yes, those came out of papers. Then, the error in paper is that, will they be on the textbook? No. When great determination of your hard effort is really important and clear enough to be in the textbook, the pictures itself are in the book. And then your fame and name is forever left by husedae, even if you die. Therefore, I think it is very important to draw a picture. I hope that you will get good enough research results to appear in the textbook and get pictures which could be inserted in the paper. And finally, acknowledgements. Acknowledgements describes what support you received. For example, how you got help by doing discussion with other peple, and you need to spend money on research. You just would describe that 'what kind of source was this research fund, and there was some other help.' These technologies may be extremely ethically important. This is one of the most important things you should think about when you write your paper because it is technically and ethically important. Finally, references. These references, in a way, are very easy to dismiss and dismiss as nothing. But in a way, it's a part that you have to write very well and make very well. Because, the reason why you're usually putting a reference is that you had quoting other people's findings first. Other people's study is nothing to do with your findings. Even though it's irrelevant, if you think it's okay because you did it with similar materials or research in similar fields, you write the reference somewhere. You may have thought that part of introduction or result is related to the result, but if you put this reference on the introduction, it could be a big problem if you put it up if it's irrelevant. The problem is that the delicate reviewers and those reviewers even read the introduction because they decided that the research results of this paper were okay. If they had read and judged the results of this study, they would have wanted to see why you did this research in introduction, or how you solve rob·lems. They are going to read your thoughts. But in the process of reading your thoughts, because they are reviewers and referees who are see references and well know them, they would think 'why did this research paper choose a reference that had nothing to do with it?‘ In that case, from the perspective of reading and communicating, I mentioned it once in part of discussion and part of result , but unnecessary content is included. If this unnecessary content is included, the reader will think, \\"Oh, this is weird.\\" It's weird or they will think, \\"Oh, I can't read this well.\\" If that happens, when your efforts are judged in this research paper, you will be slightly less likely to be evaluated. So, the way to write references is different for each research journal, but what's common is why you have to write references, why you have to quote them, and why your research results are newer than previous research results, so you have to choose the right one and try to do a good job of writing them. You will write a paper with so many contents and each part is written based on its importance. As I said, the most important part is how to explain it logically. How you explain with logic is determined by the way you tell your story. Most importantly, storytelling is the first thing you should think about when you write a paper. For example, if you have a time to discuss or introduce your research with your friends, maybe you spent a very long time writing your research paper. When you introduce it, you can't introduce it at the same time. Then, you'll usually think, \\"I have these studie because there are these researches, and because these researches has problems, I will try to follow them or overcome them. You are going to talk these things logically. The way you talk logically is storytelling. This storytelling isn't done after you write it. Yes, you have to think about it before you write it. Since you wrote it with much thought, it becomes possible when you introduce the storytelling. Then, let's take a look at how to do this storytelling in Academic Paper. There are many types. The way of storytelling is quite varied, and there are not any fixed rules. However, the reason why there is no any fixed rules, I'm telling you over and over again, is that to communicate and talk person to person is the paper. And there are several types. If you look separately, there is a typical way, too, or how to write very dramatically. Also, a series of drama is storytelling. There is a drama that is dull but continues to have a story. And there's also a drama that's very dramatic. The same way, you can also choose them. Because you are the author who write your paper. And the magazine style. Ah, usually there's a bit of confusion in this magazine, paper, and scientific journal paper, but the magazine tells everyone to read it. Nature or Science Journal is a magazine. So the magazine style is a bit of a high impact journal, and the magazine may have a unique way of doing it. But if you look at how you create storytelling in most dramatic or general ways, you can create your own storytelling very easily. I told you that it's important to speak logically in the part of result and discussion, as I told you the most important parts from the title to the 10 sections. The logic is briefly contained in this title. As an example of this title, there is that ‘I wrote all-graphene, hoping that graphene would be a transparent and flexible field emission device.’ If you look at the topic and title of this research paper, they implies everything. You might think, \\"Ah, this research paper has all-graphene as much as possible, although there are different configurations of different devices to make flexible and transparent devices.\\" Then, if you read it, the general concept doesn't come out first. It comes out from the background. Why explain the background of this study first? The background of the study is that it determines what field of study this field is in and what part it belongs to. So, we start writing the background that everyone can know easily. I'm sure you've heard of this background in magazine articles and online. It explains what graphene is like. It's well known, but they'll mention it once. When they mention it, there are points that say 'what's important'. It describes what was important, why this field is important. If they do so, it becomes a little more specific and the field is limited. The background will come out. We talk about big things, and among the important things, the background that others know well, and it's a little related to the background. You going to talk about this part. As it happens, you're going to re-explain what you've done and why you've done what you've done. So there's a way to use the flow from this typical background to the end that shows the overall look of the finishing line. How to organize dramatically is my preferred method, but it might require a lot of practice, but I think this practice is very important, so I recommend you to practice it. It's a paper that anyone researched with a similar topic. It's a published paper that was contributed to Nature, and if you look at it, it's very well written. The reason why he wrote it very well is that I can read it easily from the word 'graphene' to the end that means figure. Because when you think while reading it, you all know what kind of background it has. These can be taken care of, but, as highlighted here, the use of these words and each of these parts can be a substitute for this well-known background that we talked about in previous chapter. So when we describe these parts, we usually briefly introduce the key parts of the previous researchs in writing this dramatic way. The reason we are introducing the key parts is that the High Impact Journal introduces the best of the previous studies. It would have been best because it was key, and when we explained the results of the research, we said, \\"Why should my paper and my research result be such a good paper?“ In this way, how to talk description dramatically, if you describe ‘my paper is good’ or ‘my study is great’, reviewers usuallyl think only ‘Yes, you are great, right out here.’ But generally, in this way, you could criticize the limitation or problems in best one of previous research results, and point out the problem to the technical and scientific facts. Why are you done? You had solved. You had settled, and You hadovercomed. And if you say, with general fact, the best study and point out the problem, even if you only write short ‘I got some results though some research’, reviewers think 'wowo, there are mportant research results in this important field of the research but because they have problems, the author had get over all, this? Then, you might contains their own ideas. This yellow highlight part may contain most important research result. This makes it easier and more dramatic for all readers to access. Because of this part. It's really great if you know what the problem is in previous researchs through your ability of grasp. It's really, really great that you're saying there's a problem with very important research, or there's something you have to overcome. You deserve a compliment. But if you've solved that, it's amazing. Since you're expressing your greatness, it might be more effective to write easily doing this from the beginning, from the field and point out the problematic part and describe it briefly as \\"I did something.“ Next is a different storytelling format in a similar field of research. There's a way to write like a paper that usually points out that there's a problem. There are other research papers that describe motivation well. Rather than describing motivation as \\"problematic\\" about other studies andprevious findings, it is very important to talk about motivation calmly about why this research will be more important in the future. Then, you would talk that 'whether it is scientific or engineering' or 'there are needs' or 'because of what needs'. As you describe these words, you talk about why there's an advantage and why this paper becomes the right topic. So there are usually many trendy research papers in magazines. 'Trendy' means because there is a demand for the best results for fashionable research papers. So, because there are many ways to tell stories like this, the results of their research have some significance and you decide how to talk about the significance. So when it comes to making decisions, it's up to you to make decisions, you have to remember that to decide, talk and show writing is to communicate, and about communication , you're going to soften that communication by saying something logically and you are having to choice ways to convey well your research result. Another storytelling method is Thesis style that you write during term. Then, again motivation is written similarly. And there are processes of being written that contain advantage and why the research paper was appropriate. So, as I told you, storytelling methods are decided naturally, after you choose how to show your research result depending on the importance of the results. I hope you choice well and have a well written to the ends from the overall title. Then let me tell you a little bit about the technical content of how much data we have. As I will say in the next course, the research paper has many different titles. There's a 'Letter', a 'Full paper', an 'Article'. There are scopes and criteria required for each of these papers and the length of the contents. If you go into each magazine, when you think about how to say your research results, take a look at each of the research papers because they are well explained along with the scope. If I tell you why it has changed so much these days, you'll have to think about how you're going to write your thesis again. It's changed from a long time ago to now. If you look at the simple trend, the main figures are small and very small these days. The number of main figures is small, and the number of supporting figures is very large. Today's papers are roughly. Because so many papers are published, so many researchers write so many papers that they can't run and read all of them, so the main figures, only the really important figures, are contained in magazine, on the other hand so many data, a little less important data, are needed because so these are important for describing these main figures, that the magazine need so many back data. So a lot of back data can usually be downloaded from the Internet with other documents, and not in the main figures or main papers. However, from the perspective of reviewers and communicators, they always need supporting about results that they could not understand easily by using only main figures, and they also judge whether this is an innovative and new result from figures of supporting. You put a lot of effort into supporting figures, like main figures, so that many researchers, reviewers, and refereees can make good decisions. As such, these days, the trend is changing so that one can do one's research results. So choosing some of the main figures, as I said, will determine the number and order of the logic and how much clarity you can use to explain your research results. The order, number, and decision will determine the number of supporting and the order of supporting. So when you prepare a lot of data, you have to think about how to show clarity with logic. So I'll tell you again in the round of 5 about how to publish these papers, but I'll basically tell you a simple process. Please get ready. If you get ready, you'll make a contribution. This research paper, called \\"Cover letter,\\" when submitted, can be 10 or 20 chapters, or more. The editors of each magazine don't read all of these things. It's hard to read. So they want to quickly understand what importance that have. You have to help them figure it out so quickly. To help them, you will write a over letter. So many magazines are asking for Cover letter. So, as I said, the title is important in writing the entire paper, the abstract is important, everything is important, but one of the things I personally force is this cover letter, which can be more important than anything else. You've worked so hard to write a really good paper, contribute, and write a cover letter that the editor asked for, but if it's so hard to write this paper that you had filled out just a few and submitted them roughly, may the editors reject such a good paper in an instant, within 24 hours? Then it'll be really, really depressed. Then, if this cover letter decides it, you need to think about how much more effort you have to put into it. So for writing this cover letter, along with writing the entire paper, I spend a lot of time writing a page or two that really implies thousands of thousands of words. I hope you write well because the importance of this cover letter, which says why it's important, as I said before, background, results, and talks about them in one or two sentences without paragraphs, is really important. So the editor looks at the cover letter and checks the contents. If they think it's good, they'll go through the review process. A comment comes from the review process, and the editor sees the comment and gives you a response. When they give you the response, it can be reject or they order revise, or it can be accept. But usually the case is having undergone a revise. Suffering through the process of revise and revision, editor would be the last to your paper called ‘accept or not.’ In the process, a lot of time has been detained. This process. In the process, if you take not revision but reject, you would decide that you accepted that or you will fight or persuader, through communication with the edior. Because this process is very, very long and difficult, you have to write easily and clearly for reduce the process in the step of writing cover letter, doing submission and writing the paper for submission. So, usually many people write cover letter so short when publishing. Usually it's written a very brief. This well aware that it is very difficult to write briefly. Very difficult, but I'll recommend that if you write a lot of research papers in the future, you have to write it concisely, logicaly or clearly. And so if you are reading a lot of research papers these things, you have a need to think that ‘How did they give me clearance, how they did give me logic’. So if cover letter written like this, you would do submission through these systems. The submission the results tell that what reviewer said, like commnets, what reviewer2 told, so ‘What about this all of our response.’ In this response, the contents of the reviewer1 are ‘What is it about right and one by one, what is wrong and ask, what is exactly what an experiment where we once again shown or thought.’ Usually, when we communicate and face to face, we just talk and persuade each other. We have to communicate. It'd be nice if we could just talk about it face to face, but you don't usually know who the reviewer is. Of course you don't have to know. There are journals that let us know these days, but we don't know, so we understand exactly what that person thinks and we write response letters. After writing like this, it barely is published and that's a year or it can take a year, two years, or three to four years. In order to shorten this period of authority, I think you need to think about how to do storytelling and which paper to write your research results in, and write a good paper. This is the end of the fourth lecture, and from the next lecture 5 and 6, I will tell you again about the very technical content. Thank you. Week 5 Title: Types of publication and structure summary Title, Abstract Content: Okay. This is the fifth lecture on Academic Writing and Research Ethics. The course discussed how to write a research paper and why what and how we have to consider in the last third and fourth lectures. So many types of the way how to write a research paper and thus each importance is different than lots of considerations are needed. And today we will go through which contents should be considered. First you can see the type of publication in journals. I am sure you already know this. But for students starting for the first time, it is important to know what kind of studies they have to write, so I tell you briefly. First, articles. Full paper contains what and how you’ve done with the results, what the results are, and why they are new and important. This full paper could be more difficult for you since it contains a lot of technology contents. This can lead to an endless cycle, as shown in third lecture. It could be more difficult because there is a process of writing, and fixing a lot of parts, and making the whole context consistent. Although full paper is important, recently many journals include letters which are short and concise. So, letters are used for results containing significance and urgency. There are difficulties in writing letters with clear logic, but it could be tried first. Students are studying review paper rather writing. Not all of the professors write review papers though there are many professors. This review paper focuses on addressing the overall performance of a field. So why the field is important is shown in the review paper by the process quoting the comprehensive results on research papers. These cases are very helpful for you to write papers. So, you can read a lot and see what kinds of content are included, and how it is organized rather than writing. What is important in this review paper is that some results are graphically shown. It could be the result of the author writing the review paper, but it is usually the result of other’s one because of its importance. If your research results are good, clear, and excellent, other people will quote you on their review paper again. This is why you have to think hard about how to show the figures, data, and graphs. Because a lot of people read the review paper, if your results are quoted in the review paper and other researchers find it, they will read your paper. Thus, it’s very congratulatory that your results are on the review paper. To do so, you need to try to show graphs and data exactly on your paper. And lastly, notes. Notes are short articles that are one page or less. When you read some papers, such as the high-impact journals, or articles that introduce them, you can find out notes or news. Actually, I don’t think there are many cases for students to use notes and news. However, the notes deal with the importance of the paper, so they are written about selected papers. If there are papers and notes about results similar to what you’re doing, be sure to read them. You can see the easier and more important results in different directions on the notes. I recommend you to read notes carefully since they are articles where you can broaden your perspective on papers. To sum up, papers are written in the full paper, letter, news, or review or something like that. The review paper is also expressed in a different way for each journal, such as a progress article or review. So well, good writing skill is important whatever type of papers. In addition, the structure is important, so let’s take a look at how to write the importance of each part. There’s only one reason why it is important to write a good paper. It’s to make the paper publish. It means to reduce the chances of rejection. Wrong papers would be rejected 100% on my experience. Because readers can’t understand. This is not good. Then, most of the papers that came out are well written. So, the reason why you have to practice to write well is to save time and reduce being rejected. And no matter how good the results are, there are many cases where you don’t get recognized for the quality of your results and ideas. To avoid this situation, you need to practice to deliver them properly. This is another reason you should write with good skills and structures. So how to write well? Each composition has its own important parts. Let me just point our a few things. First, title. In the title, the most important thing in the entire research paper need to be concisely described and it should contain why you researched, why it is important, and so on. Make a title that leads others to read your paper. This is a way to increase your citation and make your findings widespread in the world. You can decide how much too concise a title is if you decide how to tell the entire paper. And the next important thing is abstract. An abstract is a short paragraph that summarizes everything in the introduction, results, summary, and conclusion. Practice explaining the words in the title by extending them instead of using them the same way. How you do this summary determines whether it is good abstract and good writing. It is important that you practice this title and abstract always no matter what you write. Again, the title, abstract, and plus, introduction is important. People see the title first as I always say in lectures. If they think the title is good or related, then they read abstract. There’s a reason why you have to write the two parts very well because people make a judgment based on the title, abstract, or cover letter. If they think both of title and abstract are great, then they read the introduction to know how the writer got the idea and what the writer thought. I often go to detail or data right after seeing the abstract, but I usually just go through the introduction. Since these three parts, title, abstract, and introduction is important, efforts to make them at similar levels with professional papers could be made. As for how to write a paper technically, each part from the abstract to the discussion has a different tense. In the case of abstract, past tense is commonly used. The background could be explained in the past tense while what I’ve done now could be written in the present tense. In the case of introduction, both of past and present tense is used. Because you need present tense when you say ideas, structures, and thinking. You write with the past tense of the previous results in introduction. Methods and results are almost past tense because they write what and how they did, and what they knew before writing this paper. But discussion includes different things from methods and results. You write a lot of things such as ‘it has a meaning’, and ‘it is important in the present tense. In the discussion part, you write in the present tense like ‘it is important rather than ‘it was important. Then, let me point out what is important about each part. First, the title is simple phrases that are not even sentences as you know. Furthermore, it is composed of the most important keywords because it needs to be concise. So, to write the title well, pick keywords from your papers such as ideas, or methods, and list them all. Pick up about three keywords. Only a few may be important or all may be important in these keywords. Give priority to each of these keywords based on its importance. If you think that other people must know about a particular keyword, prioritize it first. It is a common way to list up keywords and think titles from them. So experienced professors and researchers are always organizing keywords in their heads and thinking about how to develop them. But no-experienced students should practice organizing what they think is important and write it logically in short titles, longer results, and discussions. And the important thing is not just to say ‘I did something', but the whole result of this study should be included concisely. Words that have not been written in the paper may be used since one or two words have to show the result. You need to think about important parts of the paper and write them with keywords. I don’t write the title at first and always think it about until submission. The reason for that is simple. It’s to deliver with this importance. To do so, it should not be too short or too long. If it’s too long, the meaning can be distributed. Too short tile is not easy to convey the meaning you want. There’s a case that people, including me, use a lot. In some fields, if I need long content, I can also write it with a subtitle. It is easy to know what I did with subtitle. There are a variety of cases, such as concise titles and titles with subtitles, so it is important to write them according to your paper and logic. In title, these words are used commonly. However, many journals avoid these titles which include redundancy, formula, or symbols. Thus, it is needed to make effort to express what’s important, what’s new, and what’s essential. The other one is that you have to choose the words specific rather than wide. For example, ‘Magnetic alloy’ is too vague and is a very large area, so it is better to mention specific terms like this. It is important to create an attractive title because many people could think it is worth reading this paper after seeing the title. So sometimes, there’s a title starting like oops or oh. Actually, it’s really hard to see. You can choose words that lead attraction as much as you think. Usually, journals have titles from four to more than ten words. But as you know high-impact journals have a short title. And when you see it, you can direct know whether it contains importance. In most cases, titles are written concisely, so you need to explain your paper with fewer words. Furthermore, it could be end with question mark like this. As you see now, for example, this title “What is a gene?” makes you curious, leading you to read more. In another case, when you read “Can Water Store Charge”, you think “why?” or “How?” and are able to approach easily. That is, it is very attractive so you need to think about this format too. Or you can utilize long descriptive titles. But as I show you, long titles have less impact factor than short ones. This is because these researches are too specific and less broad. Thus, the paper could be in specialized journals. In reality, there are some titles with deep and long descriptions about some particular materials like this. When so many words are included, it is easy to understand, but it could be considered as just a simple one of the methodological studies and thus, less important. Even if it’s important in certain methodologies, it’s less important on the whole. Thus, the higher the impact factor, the shorter and more concise the title is. I’ve shown you examples so far, and I would tell you about the abstract from now on. As I’ve said over and over again, the abstract is an extreme summary. So, it should be easy for the reader to know what kind of scope there is and decide whether to read more. So, it must be clear and simple. This objective is simple. You have to include all introduction, methods, results, and discussions implicitly, and it should be very objective and accurate. While doing so, summary should be precise. You have to summarize the things written in a thousand words with pas and present tense. There are journals that can be written in 100 to 300 words, but usually, are composed of 150 to 200 words. It is short but understandable. So, when I write an abstract like this, I don’t refer to other research papers. Some cases like magazines could contain references, however, basically, you write what your research is about and what it means to you instead of reference. For example, I wrote one or two short sentences about what happened in this abstract. In detail, “There was a problem” or “There was a research”. Discuss the background in the first sentence and raise a question in the second sentence. And from the third sentence, I wrote down what research was done, what results were most important, and what it means. This is up to three sentences depending on the content. In this case, one material could be two phases. In this paper, it was important to engineer the phase transition between semiconductors and metals. Then you can put keywords in the middle in this way. The author could summarize the most important and key contents in one or two words while reporting these methodical contents. Then, readers can easily see that ‘it is related to a field called polymorph engineering’, ‘the object is this material’, and so on. If you express the strengths in a few sentences like this, the object which leads readers to understand easily could be written. It ends by saying what the specific result is and how it was obtained, and it includes a sentence that can convey such a key meaning. Then, this is a structure that conveys ‘something is a problem in some background’, ‘because something was difficult, I solved it in some way’, ‘the results of doing so can lead further future studies in this field’, and ‘so this research is important’. So, how much of the potential audience would be interested in your research results depends on choosing these methods. I emphasized titles and abstracts since they have to be concise, clear, simple, and logical. Abstract, as well as title, is written later. This is because you should write an abstract with logic that summarizes the reason, process, and result of research after writing long sentences as a whole. Like this abstract, you can write a very short paragraph last. And you should consider if the title is concise, clear, or important again. So, the course discussed the title and abstract in the fifth lecture, and the rest will be continued in the next sixth lecture again. Thank you for your listening. Week 6 Title: Introduction Materials and Methods Theoretical Basis Content: Okay, Let’s begin the sixth lecture of Academic Writing and Research Ethics 1. We talked about the way to write title and abstract and importance of them in fifth lecture. This time, I will briefly talk about how to write the introduction section and the rest of it, except for results and discuses, including materials, methods and theoretical things. The part that I’m going to talk about more intensively and more importantly than anything else is introduction section. So is the title and summary, but the introduction section is important because it lists the reason of importance, ideas and philosophies that you have, results you have achieved and the way for all of them. Usually, there is no meaningless study, but in order for the study to have a lot of meaning, you need to make others to think that this research has high importance when they hear or read it. For this reason, the introduction section is very important after title and abstract because we have to describe in detail. So, making a good introduction section needs a lot of time. Let me tell you why. Introduction section is the part that you study the most when you read a paper. I mean, do we need to read all the book with over a hundred pages to understand it? The research you’re doing right now is a very specific part of basic science field, so the research is a little smaller than the whole field. So, to understand the importance and the reason why these researches had been proceeding, there are many cases reading first or second paragraph of introduction section in detail with a lot of time. For studying. There are references in paper, so you will look for them again. Those references were written in the past, so you can understand the backgrounds of this research historically. Then you have to organize important references well and state specifically because other readers will catch why these researches have history, how you think and mention the important things in history and how you state about the importance of your research. There are several ways for writing in introduction section, but first sentence is very important. The first sentence should be written very importantly and informatively. If someone reads first sentence and think ‘this is not important at all’, they will not read it. This is why writing first sentence of introduction section importantly and informatively decides the quality of whole introduction section. So, I’m talking about why and how we write introduction sentence. Most important thing is why you started this research. After that, you write about the problem, the importance of problem and why it was important. Then what will be next? Your research should be something different with others, right? It’s new research. So, you have to write what’s different and something new. Then you have to write how you did. When you write about these two things, you always talk about what your ideas were and what you conceived. So, if there are new methods of new ideas, they will have a huge worth. Describing exactly how you obtained them and how you will talk about them will be needed in introduction section before anything else. After that, you will write 1 or 2 sentence describing which result is the most important one in last part of introduction section. By just reading title, abstract and introduction section, readers can easily read a paper; ‘Oh, this paper is written in these ways, with these ideas and results. That will be read easily, right? There will be good paper or so-so paper depending on its importance and signification, but these things are essential in introduction section to be a paper. So, describing problems and stating which contribution research made for society is very important. The thing that I always emphasize in my paper and for my students is what is my idea. I think this part, I mean why and how I did it should be philosophical basically. There will be something technical, but my research can be different with other people. Writing how you started the research and what’s different with others is very important because delivering them and your ideas well can decide the value of your paper. So usually we write introduction section with importance. Choosing appropriate tense is important and that’s why I told you before. But there are some cases when we read papers. There are too many redundancies in the beginning of introduction section. There is little redundancy in abstract section. Papers you read will have a little redundancy in abstract section, too. But the redundancy comes from these cases. If we suppose that we choose a field and there are several words in that field, it feels like there are only those words in every sentence if we use them repeatedly. Then, if you use very specialized term or define them as abbreviation and mark the importance of them frequently, it is easy to understand and feel importance of them as there are attached explanation. As using same words again and again makes readers feel redundancy and gives image of bad introduction section, I surely think that you will fixing these parts a lot with your professors in endless cycle, but you should be concerned about it in advance to write good introduction section. And here is next thing to avoid. It’s too self-evident. To write title, abstract, introduction section concisely and logically, as I emphasize, you have to avoid meaningless things and repetitive things. Choosing a language needs a lot of practice and time but though you are beginner, you can easily understand that escaping from repetitive things, redundancy and meaningless sentences or phrases are important because they can ruin the whole logic. There is another thing. I make same mistakes, too. My paper published in 2021 will be very old one when 2030 comes. But we handle the events that breaks out at the point we write, we use the word ‘recently’ a lot in introduction section. But you’d rather avoid that word if possible because the word ‘recently’ will sound weird to the people who cites and reads your paper or research results in future. So, if your paper has long span and importance, the word ‘recently’ should be avoided except the moment when you point out the problem of that specific point. There is one more mistake that people make a lot although they need to write concisely and logically. I remember that I mentioned it once in fourth lecture. The way of referencing is important, too. There was my student whose references of paper were so messed up. It was like, there were references without any importance and, or references without any relationships between research results except in the field. With these problems, readers don’t read the paper right after reading introduction section. ‘It’s totally irrelevant. Why would do that?’ So, you should cite the core papers with high importance. Citing recent review papers that people read a lot and papers containing various results is normal and usual way. Do not cite paper blindly with one sentence talking about the research. It is very important to examine carefully and choose appropriate reference. There is one tip. If you don’t even want to do that, just write a lot of things and cite one review paper because review paper contains all of them. It’s possible when that review paper has all of the things you wanted to say. There are many cases that use one review paper, not numerous references. But there are many cases that doesn’t work with just one review paper because it is important to point out the key point that was important in other people’s paper, and show the reason why you wrote this paper and did this research. If the result was recent one or so important that it can be even in the textbook, you have to mention papers including that result and reference them in introduction section. I’ll show you an example. This paper is the introduction section of ??? that I showed you in the fifth lecture. I divided it in 2 pages, and there are 4 paragraphs. As you see, fourth paragraph’s head sentence starts with ‘We report...’. Before writing ‘we report...’, there should be this in third paragraph; ‘As blah blah was the most important thing, we tried blah blah’. Yes. And when you read the last sentence of previous paragraph, you can understand the way paper says. This will include texts like this; ‘In this perspective, these substances can bring new possibilities and opportunities and that’s why it is so important’. Then the target that you research or context that target can overcome will be in the paper. And then, this will be your own idea and would not be the fact that everybody already knows. Making references to include things that everybody knows and putting something different in the main content is the way to draw people’s attention and write it logically. After that, you will highlight the importance in the last sentence right before finishing the last paragraph. It will help readers to understand what you write before. It will be basic background and more detailed background. Then if you think about the way to write introduction, you make a lot of effort to write the first word. Surely the first word is important, but in the perspective of configuration you think, just wrap up the background in first paragraph and write what was core content or write the problem like this paper in second paragraph. Things you did, the result you achieved and the way you wrote the paper will be next content and if you try to understand this flow of paragraphs of introduction section, I think it will help a lot your paper writing. After introduction section, there are ways to write material section and method section. Let’s get to that point. Why do we write material and method? It lets readers know the target of your research. Then why do we talk about methods? You did that research and other people will read that paper. The reason why you appeal your research’s worth is to help your friends who are in same competition or following you and future juniors to repeat your research. For that, writing scientific paper will be very accurate and you ought to tell them in great detail. To tell them in great detail, you need to very good at describing methodological things when you say how you did the research. In that case, just mentioning that practice can be worth enough. So, there are many cases that write method and material section mechanically but describing the merits and validity about them for future researches can be a point for a good evaluation. As material and method section has that purpose, you have to write content into the point that other people can repeat the research result. And as the result and conclusion should be useful, if you don’t say the way you researched and how you achieved the results clearly, it would be hard to believe all of them, right? It’s hard to believe. So, writing very clearly and in detail is the important point. There are several elements. Describing the materials that you used, preparation steps, protocols for practice and how you measured the measurements and calculations in detail is usual, and you have to state how you analyzed the calculation and theories. Just writing ‘we measured these, we calculated these’ will make very short sentences, paragraphs or content and make people think your paper too poor-contented, so writing in detail and let other people try and apply your valuable research result is important and that is duty of writing the scientific paper. So, the materials are not just ‘materials’, and they can be various, as I told you. Treatments can be various, too. It is easy to decide with things to write when you think what to say and how to say about the materials. There are things to avoid and ways to write. As it is about the materials, it can be just same with the previous sequences if you easily write ‘I did like this’. In that case, put references and let them make readers aware of that method. The first method. You have to explain how CTAQ was synthesized very long, but if that explanation has redundancy with other papers and is mechanical repetition, you can just put reference on them. The Second method. You can just put references for each step that you need references. So, write it with accuracy, and to get rid of big redundancies, good referencing for this material section and delivering it clearly is important. There are several things to avoid when you write these materials. There are some noobs who mention the name of company of equipment or substances to write clearly. But avoid that. Usually, making clear means writing technical specifications like exact naming of substances you used, exact amount of them and the condition you used them. In methodological perspective, writing the source or way clearly is important. If you think ‘I used these, and everybody will know about it’ and write paper, nobody reads that. So, writing material section in detail with deep concern would be great, and hope you refer these important things to mention about chemicals or materials that I posted on screen. Method section is same, too. You have to decide passive or active just like material section. We choose passive style in usual. In introduction section, we choose style like ‘my idea is this, I did this research’. We use words or sentences like this style; ‘This was measured, these substances were made.’ And please avoid maker, trade, branch or brand names just like material section. And huge amount of background contents will not be in material or method sections. But cases like magazines or high impact journals want very detailed explanation about how you achieved that result and informative because those results are so important. As there are some cases that won recognition by this, I want to tell you that you need to have a deep concern about your paper’s form to write method or material sections. Lastly, I will briefly talk about theory papers and research papers. Theory papers basically need theoretic basic thesis and method for calculation in detail. But it is really hard to read and understand the content if you try to show these detailed requirements in equations. Although usual theoretic papers use a lot of equations, theoretic paper writers try to use equations as minimum as possible and change them into languages. In theoretic papers, if there were 10 equations, writers don’t write all of them. They write first equation and some important equations. Reducing number of equations and explaining why the last one is important in finish is normal content that are described in theoretic papers. Here’s example, method section of paper that I used when I explain abstract and introductions section. Method section of this paper shows synthesis part, instrument setups part and instruments of many cases that should be measured clearly. And it describes calculation and what the researcher did theoretically. When we take a close look into the description, temperature or conditions, for example, are clearly described, and synthesis part is written in detail because other people like seniors and juniors in same lab can follow this synthesis to try this research in the same way. Plus, instrument setup part describes briefly about equipment and results achieved. Although it is brief description, it’s very important to write about the condition clearly. As without these conditions in your paper, people work in same field cannot understand which XRD brings the result, it is important to describe conditions clearly to make people understand the result and think ‘Ah, in this condition, this result is inevitable’. Also, as you see here, you have to write why you did the measurement for what you want to know briefly. Writing concisely like this is very important. It’s different with just writing ‘I did this measurement for this research, I did this for this result’. To secure justification of your research method or tools you used for research, you have to describe concisely what you tried to investigate or whether you measured just the result or measured to say something. And there are many cases that explain the methods you used for calculation part with references. Don’t make it too long. It is important to tell things that everybody knows, make it more specific for the things you researched or calculation and let other people follow your method section just like you did. As I emphasized, when you write introduction section and experimental method and material sections, introduction section needs deep concern about how to draw attention of audience and delivering your idea and that’s the main point of introduction section. It is surely important to make citations and methods of experiment clear and logical, and make your sentences and logic show that your research has depth enough. I told you about the whole configuration of paper and how to write title, abstract, introduction and experiment section, and I will end my lecture part. Thank you for listening. Week 7 Title: Results, Discussion, and Conclusion Content: Hello, I’m Kim Ki Hyun who is in charge of Academic Writing and Research Ethics in this week. In this week, you will learn about Results, Discussion and Conclusion. Last week, probably you would learn how to write Introduction, Methods and Experimental Explanation. This week, you will learn how to write Result and Discussion. Result and Discussion are the most important parts of Academic Writing. When you write and compose them in a good way, you can say that you write your writing flawlessly and your academic writing can be published. The first step to write Result and Discussion is to select appropriate data before you write those sections. So after arranging data from a lot of experiments you had, you have to choose the most meaningful data and organize them most briefly, clearly and logically. Almost every student would write research notes using any tools such as notebooks or document files to arrange raw data from experiments. As you know, you won’t use all of raw data in your writing. So the first important step is to extract meaningful data before you write Result and Discussion. Recording the memories or feelings when you got meaningful data or made mistakes during experiments and putting those things in your writing are also important for your writing. For example, we can’t remember contents, mistakes, or specially-observed data after a month. So it’s important to record your thoughts and memories when you found meaningful data on your research notes. After extracting meaningful data from research notes, you have to decide which can show your writing most efficiently, such as table or graph before you write results. After you make tables/figures efficiently, arrange in a proper order to make a logical story. This process can be the most important and difficult part when you write Result and Discussion. In addition, in Result section, it’s important to put distinctive data or problems that you found in the process of experiments in the logical story if you think it’s meaningful. And you have to separate Result section and Discussion section and write only results in Result section. In Discussion section, you should write how you interpret the results. Now on, let’s see how we should write Result and Discussion properly. As you know, because purpose of writing Result is to express effectively what we discovered or observed, it’s important to rearrange results and express briefly for public and readers who read your writing. Showing results as figures or tables is well known as the most effective and definite method. So after deciding if you convert the data into tables or figures, you should also decide what kind of figures can express data most effectively and conveniently because there are various ways to express data. Most of all, it’s so important that you write results objectively. For example, when you explain “The car is fast,” you need detailed numbers such as “The car is 150km/h fast.” You should not express subjectively like “very effectively,” “good” but explain results showing specific numeric values, and those values should have comparison target. For example, you need to write “The medicine is ~ times as effective as existing medicine” when you explain “The medicine is effective.” You need to write “ This device has better control than the existing device,” when you want to explain the device you made. In Discussion section, you should explain how to interpret the results, as I said before, you’d rather separate Result and Discussion section. Result section includes what you observed or measured. Discussion section includes interpretation of the results and impactful explanation about meaningful data. But nowadays, Discussion and Result section are often hybridized together. Once I wrote my thesis, I put some discussion in Result section. Some reviewers commented “Why did you write discussion in Result section? You should move this part to Discussion section.” In these days, there is a growing trend that Result and Discussion are hybridized like Result-Discussion-Result-Discussion. For example, in this writing, there is a subtitle here in Result section. A keyword is here on the top of the paragraph explaining this result, and this figure is composed well of the result. The result of this thesis is written like this. You can see how the author of this thesis explained the results very clearly and objectively using specific numeric values. And this thesis has hybrid section of Result and Discussion as you can see. In this writing, this graph shows result well, like in figure1, ~~ explains ~~ result. And figure1-b is an good example of objective explanation. In most of recent writings Result section is written with fancy graphic design, and also neat graphs with a sense of unity. One of the important thing when you write Result section is selecting important and proper results among all results you have observed. You would have a lot of data in these days, but the better the writing is, the less figure it has, like 4~5 figures, or 6. Less important data-however, you have to include it in your writing- is put into supporting information or appendix material file. Some writings have 60, or even more than 100 figures and data in supporting information because they have a lot of high level data. Look at this sample. Here is a method in the front of results. This writing has separated Result section. The author wrote subtitle on Result 3-1 and here are the contents of subtitle. The figure consists of A~F with splendid composition. And figure 1A shows ~ result, figure 1B shows ... result with objective numeric values. Here is supporting information – figure S1A. Important data are in figure 1A~F, and less important data are in supporting information file. They are written in the middle of Result section. So figure S1, S2 mean the numbers of supporting information. At the end of the writing, here is appendix and it shows that there are data in supporting information file. You can check numerous high-leveled data in supporting information file if you open the data. So it takes several years to be included in good papers in these days. It’s important to write research notes and arrange data because you can use not only data included in the body of your writing, but also remaining data which should be put in your writing. To write Result section, first of all, extract meaningful data from raw data, which is massive and unorganized. Then decide tools to express the meaningful data such as table, or figure. After making tables/figures, decide the order of tables and figures. There are cases where we should compensate preceding data to support quality data. So we sometimes do experiments for preceding data later to make data prettier and more logical. But the preceding data should be put in the sooner order than the quality data. Therefore, it’s important to rearrange order tables and figures to make your papers logical. After deciding the order, create a storytelling to explain results according to tables and figures. All figures and tables should be explained in text as if talking. Even in case of thesis, it’s better to explain results simply, distinctively, logically, and with fun like a story or a fairy tale, so that ordinary people can understand it than to give a hard explanation. So in Result section, you need to make a storytelling text after making these figures. You have to make a really good table and figure. I’ll teach you how to make a table and figure next time. At this time, I’ll explain how to write Result and Discussion section intensively. In Result section, you need to summarize good result data you found. After analyzing data, convert analyzed data into proper format, and point out what was observed most importantly. For example, here is a table about data 1 to 10. You don’t need to explain every single data because we can’t recognize what’s impactful and it’s boring. So you should emphasize data 4 -for instance- if it’s most impactful and highlighting. Another good way to explain specific observation is questioning and answering. And you must explain about result of control experiment. Because a result of control experiment becomes the standard of effectiveness. In addition, nowadays AI is really developed and numeric values in thesis are converted into data, so it’s also important to show negative results. Express results didn’t appear about negative results. Above all, don’t forget to explain if the result is statistically meaningful and write important negative results. Meanwhile, you shouldn’t write discussion interpreting results in Result section. Because it should be in Discussion section. And it’s meaningless to explain background again because you would already explain background in Introduction. In Result section, just results. You don’t need to repeat what you wrote in Method. You also don’t need to explain raw data in the middle, and specific calculation. Let’s wrap up Result section. I’m telling just general cases, it depends on theses. Generally these are much-criticized part so remember it. You should write Result section in the past tense. Because you write the results that you already did experiments. And put numbers in order on figure or table. Sometimes, Figure 1 comes out first and Figure 3 and then Figure 2, but it shouldn’t be like this. Figure 2 can come out again after Figure 3 if it came out sooner than Figure 3. So you should put numbers in order on Figure or Table, and you should mention Figure 1 in text if Figure 1 exists. So remember you should quote table/figure number in text if you have it. Let’s look at this sample. Here is Result, and subtitle. Probably the contents of this subtitle is being described here in text. This is supplements data, same as supporting information. It’s less important than the main figure, but still important so it’s in supplements data. Here are much supporting data. ‘Figure 2A is from this data’ is written here. Figure is consisting of A~D. As you see, Figure 1 comes out first. Figure 1 first, especially 1A, 1B first then 1C. Figure 1, 2, 3, they are in the right order. And then Figure 4 here, right? It’s important that figures should come out according to their numbers so remember it. Although we can’t look all of these contents, you need to remember that data should be written objectively in Result section. And now, I’ll explain about Discussion section. A purpose of Discussion section is to provide interpretation of results you found. This section is a part that supports the reason why you came to this conclusion. Although this is interpretation of the results, you have to write really objectively. Don’t write subjectively. You can explain distinctive points or particularly negative points, and why it was negative or positive in this section. The easiest way to explain is comparison with existing data, such as how different your research results are from already-known knowledge. If results were different from general facts, what’s different? If results were better, what’s better? If results were worse, what’s worse? Or results fits well with original purpose. In Discussion section, explain why they didn’t if results didn’t fit. It’s easy to write Discussion when you write if our first hypothesis worked out, how those results can influence, how logical your results are, or how they can be applied later. Of course it depends on the field of study, you can write within these 4 categories. As I said, Discussion is like this when you write Result and Discussion separately. But nowadays many academic writings are mixing Result and Discussion section together, and that might be more logical. In my field of study, we prefer writing Result and Discussion together to writing them separately. For instance, result A is ~~ because it’s ~~ and it’s expected to ~~ and result B is like ~~ and …, because it’s better to explain logically. Let’s look at this thesis. This also has a form that write Result and Discussion section together. Here is a subtitle, and first figure with figure number 1, It’s S1, it means this data is in supporting information. So Figure 1 comes out first. And looking at the interpretation of the results, here is Figure 1. It looks neat and clear, unifed with A, B, C, D, E, F. It’s a good sample of integrated Result and Discussion, writing results, inserting discussions in the middle and putting reference together to explain why author interpreted results in this way. So sometimes it’s more convenient to write thesis and looks more logical. You can write according to your field. We tend to write Result and Discussion together also in my field. To give a tip for writing Discussion, it’s good to write this section like you give a presentation in a seminar. It’s more comfortable to explain using Q&A method. There is a case that you explain important mechanism to draw results, and you can also write research results as many as possible in Discussion section. I think it’s good to explain if your hypothesis is right or wrong and why, and if the design you experimented supported hypothesis properly and why, or not, what you can suggest as an alternative. Let's look at it in table. When the research results are consistent with the hypothesis, explain this theory is correct and why. On the other side, when results are different from hypothesis, explain why they are, then it’s Discussion. Don’t write this in Result. There would be strange writing Discussion later than Result in some fields of study. Then, it’s a good way of combining Result and Discussion to put explanation that results came out different from we expected, comparing with some existing literatures or data. You should write Discussion in a simple way, not too difficult. It’s important that you interpret your research data in proper depth, I know it’s hard to define how deep is “proper,” because it’s difficult for readers to understand your writing if you use too difficult theory and methods. In Discussion section, you can explain theoretical implication or ways to apply practically, express theories, specific relevance, or generalization when you made certain equation or pattern. Also you can explain more in detail about exceptions, or summarize various results you got from experiments. Continuously, it’s about how to write good Discussion. You won’t be able to answer all of questions by one experiment. So you had better draw a big picture during Discussion section. In the back of Discussion part, you write the meanings from your research results, how your research and research results can go far in your field, and what you recommend as a follow-up research. These are some good ways to wrap up Discussion section. When you mention researches that have already been conducted, use past tense. Use present tense when you mention general principles or facts. You may judge this. Next, what do you have to avoid? Don’t write things too inconclusive, abstract, imprecise expression in an unobjectified state. Don’t repeat results already in Result section, and already used expression in manuscript. Be cautious not to write contents you wrote in Result repeatedly. This is my thesis. It’s about making a platform that finds antiviral active substances concerned with covid-19 virus we have suffered for a long time. You can notice that by the title. I’ll tell you the start of Discussion section. You can start with explaining general concept. Because we made a platform that finds antiviral active substance from natural product, I explained what natural product is. Then I explain why we found the substance from natural product, results are like these and ~~ meaning. So first, explain the biggest key and concept of your thesis in Discussion section. The point is that you should write content that wasn’t included in introduction although it could be. Start with general stuff and get more detail and detail, to the part that interpret results, summarize results, and mention what the next research should be in the future. Now it’s Summary. Actually most of theses do not need Summary so some of them have it or not. But in case of very long full-papers, it’s helpful for readers to understand when you put summary in each main point. Because it’s too long and contents are extensive, organizing contents for each section is effective. So Summary shouldn’t be too long because it’s confusing what the purpose is. And in Communication Form, it has Summary sometimes because it doesn’t have Conclusion section. In case of short papers, such as note form or communication form, Summary section makes an end of the papers instead of Conclusion section. So check format of each thesis, journal. This is a thesis in communication form, and it doesn’t even have Introduction. It directly starts from the main part of thesis, and doesn’t have Result and Conclusion. Here is “In Summary” to summarize the preceding contents briefly. This communication form contains a summary, which is more like a conclusion than anything else, and that’s the concept. Lastly, there’s a Conclusion. As you all know, in order to clearly and briefly interpret a whole papers including Result and Discussion, we write “Conclusion.” Of course, you’re not going to use all the findings and results. You just have to write down the major results, and you can write down the parts you want to point out. You can’t rewrite what’s in the Discussion, and suddenly write down something irrelevant. You can organize what you’ve organized since it came out well. And of course, you have to write based on the results you used in your thesis, You can't just bring the Abstract. This is very important. The good content in Abstract should actually be included in the Conclusion. When people first look at the Abstract, they can predict that this paper would have produced this result. That pretty and predictable Abstract should go into Conclusion as it is, but you can’t write it exactly the same. So be careful. However, the easiest way to write Conclusion, in my case, is to bring the Abstract to Conclusion and erased Background, and organize conclusion in a slightly different way of tone and order. As you see, Conclusion is not another Abstract but the content is same. So the key point is that you only have to write down important results and findings. For example, there is a research paper with the hypothesis, “Is there a man on the moon? What do people on the moon eat for breakfast?” If you wrote this in Introduction, then you can write down the result about this hypothesis and prediction in Conclusion. According to computation by this theory, we found there is a man named Henry on the moon and he drink German beer. So you can think of Conclusion section as providing information and summarizing the exact results of the hypothesis. Let’s take a look at the content of Conclusion lastly. Conclusion is probably the mandatory section for most papers. So this paper also has Conclusion section in No. 3. You can do the summary as it is. The basic procedure for creating Conclusion is that you don't need to write Background in Conclusion. Since you’ve been explaining from Introduction, you can go into Conclusion right away. Author wrote “We developed ~~” in this thesis. So in Conclusion, about questions like “what did you study?”, you can answer “we developed ~~”, “we investigated ~~”, “we found these medicines.” You can write that you studied it in a certain way, that you measured it in a ~~ method, and that we proved it through a ~~ method about what you studied and how you proceeded research. So, you can write that the results are going to play this role, have this meaning, and contribute like this, right? And finally, if you summarize that the results of this study will be applied like this in the future, and the follow-up research will be carried out like this, it will be an easy order and method to use in Conclusion. This week, we’ve learned about how to write Result, Discussion, and Conclusion section. Thank you for listening. Week 8 Title: Tables/Figures Content: Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> who will teach you about ways to make Tables/Figures in academic writing this week. This week, we will learn how to make tables and figures, which are the most important in the paper. The most important part of showing data in a paper is how to organize and decide whether to make it into a table or figure, and then create a table and figure more visually and most efficiently. So what we're going to learn this week is very important. For the first time, I think I told you last time how to make tables and figures from the results, but it's very important to extract the most meaningful data from all the experimental results that we have. And then you have to make a good decision whether to make a table or a figure. Then, set the order of table and figure. Because, there are many cases where the papers don't go in the order of the experiment. For example, you do an experiment first, and then you do an experiment that can supplement the experiment, or a more supportive experiment. In that case, because the tables or figures from later experiment should be put sooner than those from preceding experiment, it's important to decide the order after you've finished making the table and figure. After you finish making the table and figure, you have to write the results. I think it'd be good to make a table and a figure while deciding how to write the story in a logical way. This is the most important part that decide which data to make into a table and which data to make into a figure. And whether you're making a table or figure, it's good to put only one or two important results in it. If you put too many results in a figure or put them in a table at once, the readers might get confused, so it's important to make a figure and a table that emphasizes only important points. Let's learn how to make a table first. Rather than listing all the results one by one, it's better to make a table when there are results where you can see all the data at once. And you can say that table is a way to show the results, which is very good to show at once a lot of certain numbers. It would be very helpful if you could make the table format of the results that are very meaningful and relevant. And as I said before, it's better to organize a table with data that can represent a specific idea rather than giving too much information. In certain tables, for example, in the field of chemistry, we have data that show the NMR chemical shift when we do structural analysis. Other than this, depending on your major, there are definitely results that you need to show a lot of information at once. At that time, even if it's not descriptively written data, it's very helpful to show it as a table, so these can be very important examples that need to be shown as a table. And for table, every table must have a number and a name. Table 1. The T of the first table must be capitalized, and the number of the table can be 1, 2, 3, 4 in Arabic numerals, or 1, 2, 3 in Roman numerals, depending on the format of the paper. You have to look carefully at the form of the paper you're going to submit. If there is Table 1 in the text, it must be mentioned somewhere in the text. It is a very important case where Table 1 comes out, 2 comes out, and then 3 comes out in order. For example, this is an example of a table in a very unusual situation. This figure is cut off at the top, but here are b, c, d, e. This is actually a table. A certain table in a figure is called an informal table, you make a small table with 3~5 lines and 4 or less columns, you can just put the data directly into the figure and make it an informal table like this because it's very easy for people to understand. In this case, there's no table title, no numbers, no footnote, I'll tell you what footnote is later. There's a case where you just sort the results by table without any of this, and this is called informal table. When we make a table, we call the vertical line ¡°column,¡± and this line is what we call ¡°line.¡± So this is a table that has 4 columns and 5 lines. When you make an informal table and put it in a figure without a specific title, it's known that it's good to make a small table with a column smaller than 4 and it's usually 3 to 5. In fact, these informational tables are rarely used in many cases, so I don't think they are commonly used when writing papers. But I told you because you might sometimes use it. Now, we're going to look at what we should do when we make a formal table. If you want to make a table, you need at least three related columns. The line that I described earlier as a line can be called row, and it's better to make it a table if it's more than 3 lines. For example, if you make two columns and two lines of table, it's this small? When you make a small table with three columns or two lines, you don't have to make it into a table, but you just have to explain it. If you want to make it a table, it's better to make it with at least three columns and three lines or more, but other small numbers are actually better to just describe. It's good to make the table simple and very concise. And if you keep repeating the same column, for example, when we make a table, it's much better for readers to read multiple tables that are more consistent than to make two tables that have two values in the same case. Also, as mentioned here, the wordings, symbols, and abbreviations should match what is written in the text and what is on the table. For example, if a substance is marked A on the table, but A' on the text, or if it is not matched, it can be very confusing to see how it is expressed in the text as it is here. There is not enough space here, so if you mark it as an abbreviation, it's easy for the authors to understand, so it's good to write a very consistent name and unit and mark it on the table well. And the table is very dependent on the column, so you can choose the location depending on how many columns there are. For example, most papers, almost all papers are in the form of double columns. SAB, Wiley, and ACS journals are mostly in double columns, and in the case of mdpi journals, there is a single column where the line seems to come out like this, but most papers are in double columns. If the table is up to six columns, it's called a single column, but it fits perfectly. The table with about six columns goes in here. But if it's over 13. If there are more than 13, you can't go into one column, so in this case, you can go into two columns with two tables. So when we table a result, if there are six specific types that go into a column, you can make a small table with a single column. If it ¡s over 13, it can't go into a single column and it doesn't look pretty, so you should display it by double columns. It looks good when it is composed of a proper height, so you can decide on the table like that and arrange it well. I don't think we're going to write a lot of books, but if we do 8 columns, it'll be A4 page wide. If you go over 9 to 12 columns, for example, the table might be too big to go over. Then you can turn this around and put the table in like this. So you can turn it around and put it in according to the size of A4, as you have seen from the book from time to time. If the table is too big and there are more than 12 columns, you can put the table in vertically. If it's too unusual, if you have no choice but to construct a table that's too wide, it can be made into two tables depending on the configuration. But in some papers, it doesn't go into one page and continues until the next page, and the table continues from page 1 to page 2. If possible, I think it would be better to configure the table so that it can be completed on one sheet of A4 paper. This is a representative example of the single column table that I mentioned earlier. This is an example of Table 2 among the papers consisting of two columns. You have to mark Table 2 and write the title very concisely. Table 2 should be mentioned at least once in the text. And there are 5 columns and 7 lines. As I explained earlier, I said that up to six can go into a single column. Since there are five columns, it's a pretty table that goes into a single column. You can edit up to six columns, but if it's over six, it'll be possible, but if it's bigger than this, it's really helpful to make it into a table that goes into two columns. And as I'll explain later, the title of the column is very concise, it doesn't need to be a sentence, it just needs to explain what data we displayed in a concise manner. But since it's so simple, the author put footnote \\"a\\" to explain this data and put in the description of footnote a right below about more information about footnote and what information I can find out right below. So this is the concept of using footnote. Because the title can't be too long. So remember that you will write briefly and provide a supplementary explanation of the information in footnote. That's how you organize the columns. And this is the representative NMR data that I explained earlier. Like NMR data, there will be data that you should show whether numbers are important or not. It's not about importance of data, like using NMR data no.35 because it's important, and not using data no.36 times because it's not important. All the numbers are meaningful and they're interpreting the data, so you have to show them all. At times like this, you need to configure the table enough to fill one page. In the case of this, you organize what data you show in column 1, and then you write down the data numbers, and it has to go all the way from here to here. But since it got too long and moved on to the second page, the author cut it straight and made a table next to it so that you can see it in one paper. Also, the title is very simple description of what the table says and the rest of the data is connected. Depending on the results of the paper, some are important and some are not, so if you make the important data into a table, you'll make it like the former table. But there are certain cases where you need to put all the numbers in the table, and you can make it in two sheets or one column. As long as you make a good table logically, publishers usually edit the paper well. So you don't have to worry about that. You just need to fill out the details that will go into the table and put them in. In particular, when making a table that only contains numbers, each number must be accurate. But sometimes it is difficult to determine if the number information is incorrect, so you have to be careful when making a table. And in the case of this table it has 8 columns. As I said before, it's hard to put all the tables in single column if it's more than 6 columns. The table has 8 columns, right? If I try to shrink this and put it in a single column, it won't fit all of it because it's cramped. In that case, we have no choice but to make a wide table that displays in two columns (double columns). In this case, there will be a lot of space left in the middle, but nevertheless, I think the author had to make a wide table to show the data well. You can make it into 2 columns (double column) or 1 column (single column). Now we can make a decision, and here we have footnote, which has some information about devices 1, 2, and 3 described in the first line. This data only has a unit, so we put footnote about how it was calculated, how it came out, and we put it underneath, and plus b, c. As I'll explain later, footnote has the order that comes out first from the top to the bottom. And you write it from left to right. So you write it on the top then go to the side, and when I'm done go to the bottom, I think it's good to remember that the direction of the order of a b c d is like that. And as I explained earlier, this is one paper. It's just one page, so you can think of it as a table. For example, this table has 11 columns. Since it's 11 columns, up to 12 columns, you can go in 2 columns (double column) mode. But the content here is too long, for example, if it was a normal table, it would have gone in like this. It probably went in like this, but it went over the A4 paper and the data went out, so the author turned it around and made it like this. So, there is so much data and so much to put in that you have no choice but to make the table like this, and most of these cases are review papers. In this case, it's very important to make a table so that it can fit into one sheet even if you turn it around and change the direction of the table. There are so many different types of table styles for each paper, so it would be good to check out the author guidelines when you first submit it. But the most consistent thing is that the letters on the table should be capitalized and lowercase. The letters are often arranged in the middle or on the left. Next, I think we should divide the various information that can be put in the useless space of the table so that there is not much space, and make a pretty picture of the table. In conclusion, I'm saying to design it well. As I said before, the best way is to put everything in one page. Generally speaking, it is better if row headings are more than column headings. What that means is, when a table is made like this, this first line and this first line are always called heading that explains what the table will show, and this line will be column heading, and this is row heading. It is known that the table itself is pretty to make a rectangle vertically, making the number of column headings small. Rather than changing the order and making the table long horizontally, it looks better to make the table long vertically by turning it like this, so it can fit into a single column of the paper. Nevertheless, there may be cases where tables are made like this. Of course, there could be. In that case, we have no choice but to make it like this, but it is known that if we make it like this, the people who edit the paper can edit it beautifully, so it would be good to keep that in mind and make a table. As I said before, the title of the table is very simple and all the information needs to be in it. So this doesn't have to be a sentence. Each title would be not a sentence. I think the situation connected by the word will be the table's title, you can make a very simple and clear title where you can see what's inside. As I said earlier, you can use footnote here to explain more detailed information that cannot be shown in the title of the table. And this is what I explained earlier, too. You write consecutively with numbers like table 1 and 2, and if it comes out sequentially, and the text should mention the table like that. This is also a typical example of a table. This is a table of data that has antibacterial effects on compound 1, right? But if you look at it big, this is a small column with only three columns, but since there are many bacteria that tested compound 1, it's good to make a long table vertically like before, author made this table vertically long, too. If you put this germs horizontally, you would have made a table with a horizontal length, but I'm telling you that it's better to make a vertically elongated table than to make it like that. And here is footnote. Author wrote penicillin here, and what's penicillin? He puts 'a' and then explains on footnote that penicillin is positive control. Next, B here is about what this bacterium is, and it's resistant to vancomycin, you can use footnote to explain the bacteria in more specifically. The important thing is a straddle rule, as you can see, there are 3 columns. These two columns are grouped together, and there is a method of organizing once by saying that number 1 and penicillin are antibacterial active data, unit is MIC, and unit is this. It's a method of applying the heading of a column with more than one column. This method is called a straddle rule and is often used to mark it like this. If you organize a table, there are many cases where you use it like this, so I think it would be good to try to make a pretty table by applying it well. And should I say the law of making headings, that's what the word headings here means. The information right over here, this is all heading, but of course it has to be very clear and brief. You can use any symbol or abbreviation here. Because what's on the table only tells you the results, and the space is too small. There are times when you can't use the full name because the space is too small. Then simply, as [1] is written for compound number 1. You can use it briefly like that, and you can use abbreviations. The heading of the column should match the one in the text. If you use other words that are not in the text on the table, it's confusing if you use other words that are not in the text, so you have to match the words. Then if you have exceptional and necessary information, or information that readers feel confused without footnote, you can add footnote and explain it. And the rest of the table has to match the same style. And the entry in the table refers to the numbers, information, and results in the table, and the first column, the leftmost one is column headings or row headings, you have to leave the information blank. And then there's Ditto. It's never going to happen, but what kind of example should I give you? For example, here's a device called A and a device called B, C, D, E. The performance of this device called A, a certain volt. Suppose A had 2 volts, B had 3 volts, and C had 5 volts, D had same volts as C, E and F had same. This is called a ditto, and no one uses this on a table. I'm not going to use this mark in my official paper. It's a given, so this is a sign that says Ditto. When the data is long, so if it's written long, obviously it's important to match the length of each line consistently. There are times when I use something like this. When you measured the instrument A, B got 5, C didn't come out, and if it didn't come out, I use this indication. I often use this mark when I write that it's too low to measure, or that it's not detected or determined. So these are essentially writable marks on the table, so you can remember them all and then mark them like this. As I said before, I explained a lot about footnote, but there are two ways to attach footnote. One is general footnote and one is specific footnote. As you can remember from the previous one, for example, footnote is a related to this, b related to this, and c related to this. This, this, this is the only one that applies. This is a specific footnote. If you look here, there's an [a]. There's an a in the entire title. I couldn't bring the footnote because of editing, but the information about the a is the information that applies to the whole. So you can think of that as a general footnote. This is a good example. The title of this table is an explanation of this. Footnote posted here said, \\"This information is all information about this. These are the numbers that apply to all of this,\\" it ¡s general footnote. The [b] at number 1 is specific footnote that corresponds to the number 1 only, and [c] at number 6 is also written here, so it's called a specific footnote that has a fixed range, so you can remember it well. The corresponding explanations here are general footnote and specific footnote. And footnote is different for each paper. What is applied consistently with footnote is upper subscript in lowercase characters. It's the basic form to write Italic. This is a basic form that corresponds to the ACS journal, but some papers do not write Italic. Most of them use Italic in upper subscript with lowercase letters. They are written in alphabetical order. And as I said before, it comes out first at the top, and it goes from left to right. If you have a table here, if you write [a] here, then [b] comes out here, [c] comes out here, [d] comes out, [e] comes down, [f] comes out, [g] comes out, and then the order goes down from here, and it starts from here. Please remember that the order goes like this. There is \\"ND,\\" an abbreviation for \\"not determined\\" in footnote. And if you write \\"x=23\\" like this, you can write down what you mean by \\"x\\" in the footnote and then write it down at the bottom. So you can do it like this. This is how you usually make a table. Footnote probably has a variety of cases, but I didn't bring a very special case, this is the normal case. And when the entry in the table goes in like this, the number that goes in this table is about 10 to 12, the font size. About 10 would be the best. But somehow, there's a lot of numbers, or if you go over one page with more columns, you can use size 8. Even if you reduce the number font size to 8, it's okay when you edit it. But if it's smaller than 8, it becomes too small. Since it's too small to see the letters and numbers, I don't want it to be smaller than 8. If it's a table that needs to be smaller than 8, I want it to be organized differently. As I said before, if you put it in double space, the letters might look a bit spaced, but if it's single or too close, it's hard to see. That's why it's good to use double space. This is a really good saying. You have to put only one piece of information in one line. I¡¯m telling you not to put multiple of these in a single cell. For example, there is a device called A. There's a device called B. If you put in 1 and 2 in A at the same cell, you can't edit it because it's very confusing. So you can't purposely put space or enter in between the lines. 1 and 2 in A, 3 in B, and 4 in C. There are 1 and 2 in A by enter button. Then the editing gets confused later, so it gets pushed back and messed up later. So this is really important. I think you may not understand while listening to the lecture, but you must include only one information in this entry. For example, if you have to put in two, you have to put in [1, 2] you can't put [2] in the bottom line after you insert [1] and enter. That's very important, so I hope you remember it well. Students make a lot of mistakes, so I think we need to be careful. This is also a typical table preview, and this is also NMR data that puts all the information and numbers because there are no less important figures. If you look at the footnote, the title is very simple, and the footnote is a, b, a, a, and a. This is a, followed by b, and then a can come out again. And then b can come out again. If it's going to be c, it should be after this, but there's no c. Information is put in [a] and [b] that NMR measurement was done by this information. And number 3 is the same information as A, so the author added A. That's why I marked it like this. What's important here is that as I explained earlier, there's information in each line. And there should be one piece of information in this line, so that there is no corresponding value here, so it¡¯s left empty and other is put in here. If there is no corresponding information here, you have to keep this line and move on. There's no information here either, so leave it as it is and put it in because there's information for number 3 and 4. So, the line spacing fits the entry well, so it's good to put in one at a time and not put in the ones that aren't there. You have to do that. And you have to put units. So you have to put in that this unit is a unit that applies to everything. I don't know what the thesis is here, but it's not written in Italic. It ¡s a characteristic that it ¡s not written in Italic. Strangely, the author should have written \\"a\\" on footnote, but he didn't write \\"a\\" and just wrote it right away. There's a style that you can use like this. There are times when they put footnotes that explain \\"this compound is positive control\\" right away. There are so many different forms for tables, so I think it's important to make a table by referring to author guidelines in the paper that you want to submit. Then, after the table, how to make a figure is very simple. Figure is a painting, so it's not very formal actually. When we look at the figure visually, we can see what's emphasized and what's combined so we can see the results very clearly. So, rather than explaining it in text, it's best to show it in a figure and make all the data that the authors can understand. There are many kinds of paintings. Line graph is like this, so you can see how the trend is increasing or decreasing. We use bar graph the most. Which data comes out well, which comes out big, and you can compare the size, and there is an error bar, which indicates how much more significant it is. I know pie graph too well. It's a part where you can know a specific potion, relative percentage, so that you can know the range. We use a lot of figures these days. The data that shows absolutely accurate information is put in figures. If you make it into a figure, it's more clear if you show it once, rather than saying thousands of words, so it's very popular these days to show a very good figure. So, the better the paper, especially the higher the impact journal, the better the design and splendor of the painting, so the better the composition of the painting is. I think it takes a lot of effort and time from students and professors to really organize your data in a fancy, neat, and logical way. Basically, if you look at good and bad examples, as you can see them well. Good and bad examples. It looks like a bad example. Because the drawing itself isn't pretty. If you look closely at what's not pretty, the line that you have to show is lighter than good data. It's kind of iffy to see what tendencies there are. These dots are big so that they're not scientific, right. It should be changed more concisely. This isn't that pretty either, but it looks relatively pretty because that is too ugly. This is kind of bad, too. The font isn't pretty. This is too big. I think it's kind of fancy, but it's tacky, right. So it should be made simple. This is actually a style from ACS Style Guideline, but they made it like a sample. The numbers we have to look at have too small numbers. Make the numbers bigger and make it look more concise. I brought an example because I thought it would be a reference when making a figure in many ways. If you look at this figure, it looks better than this one. Why does it look good? If you look closely, you can't tell what the bar graph means. There's not much difference in light and shade. So we can divide it into three colors: white, a bit darker, and much darker. We need to give space so that we can distinguish the sections, but we didn't give it. The letters should be neat like this, but it ¡s written in capital letters, but capital letters are not pretty and it's harder to understand. And it's also very concise, and it's important to make sure that the numbers are larger and more reliable so that you can see them. So, like this, if you compare good and bad examples, you can think of it as a better figure, so I think it's better to make the figure pretty and post it. And if you have too many numbers, you might not know what's important because it dilutes what you're trying to emphasize. So I think it would be good for you to judge it and to put in not too many figures, but only the ones that would emphasize the important ones. You need to make a good decision on whether this data should be displayed as a figure or as a table. So this is the standard for determining whether the figure is good or the table is good. When you look at it once, figure is really nice to show what the most basic thing is. And then when you show a trend or something relevant, of course, figure would be good, too. But if you want to show me the exact number, of course the table is good. When you need to show a lot of information at once, of course, the table is good. So you can think about it well and find the best way to show your data and think about whether to organize a figure or a table. In the past, I was told to use black and white. Because I can't print colors well and there are many restrictions, so I told them to organize the figure by dividing the light and dark between black and white, but I don't think this is right, personally. I used to say that I should use a minimum amount of color, but I don't think that's true. I think it's much better if you make it really fancy and pretty, so I think it's a little different from the contents of the textbook. In this case, it's a result that can't be expressed in a table. You have to express it in figures. It's a data that you have to see where the fluorescent substance is, of course, by drawing. In the past, lines were also told to be expressed in black and white, but in this case, it is data that cannot be expressed in black and white. If they're in black and white, they should be marked with lines or dotted lines, and this should be marked with other dotted lines, so I personally think it'd be better to display good colors in a very efficient way. Like this, I really expressed it with colors in a pretty way. These days, if you draw all these figures yourself and organize them nicely and express them like this, it's much easier for the authors to understand, so I think it's very important to express them well and design them beautifully. When you draw something like this, you can't take it from somewhere. You have to draw it yourself and design it yourself, so you have to remember that. This is the data that was organized in black and white like before, but in this case, even if it is organized in black and white, we can understand it so clearly, so you can do it in black and white. You can definitely use black and white for westerns. Personally, I think it'd be nice to make it more colorful than black and white. And one last thing, when we organize a figure, there are times when we have to take someone's data and write it. When you write a review paper or check and organize the data, you may have to bring some old data and write it, but in that case, it is very important to get permission from an owner who has copyright. Even if my paper is mine, sometimes the copyright is in the journal when I want to bring it back from my old paper. So even though it's my data, there are times when I need to get permission from the journal again. The only exception is known to be okay with what happens by the U.S government. So if you use the data you used before, there is this form. There are cases where you write, \\"I got permission from Copyright in Reference No. 10, so it's reprinted.\\" There's a form for each paper. You can check it out and use it like that. These things are also in the journal guidelines. So there is a format that uses it like this, so you can remember and use it. This is actually my thesis. It's a review paper, and this is a figure that we brought from Reference No. 33. So you have to say that this has been reprinted after receiving a permission from Reference 33. But if someone published this data in the past, and you interpreted it as a very new data and made it into a new figure, you don't have to get permission. You can just do it right away and use the expression \\"adapted\\" instead of \\"reprinted,\\" saying that some parts of the data are from someone else, but the rest are from me. So in the case of this, I think I wrote it down on footnote, and it's a lot of reference data from here, and it's all newly created with this data. You don't need permission to make it. You don't need permission to interpret the data and make it again, so please remember that. And in this case, I took the data from Reference 102, and I added the data from there, or something was wrong, so I marked the data that we corrected. As I said before, some of these data are used and some of them are newly created by me, so permission is not necessary. There are many cases like that in review papers, so it would be good to remember when writing such review papers. Today I talked about a lot of things because table and figure are very important and it got longer. Thank you so much for listening to me for a long time.","completion":"Given the extensive information and complexity of the provided lecture series on academic writing, below is a synthesized summary focusing on the essentials of creating titles and abstracts for academic papers.

Так в 1483 и 1499 гг. Иван III посылал туда военные экспедиции, но суровый край так и оставался неизведанным. Территория Сибири XVI столетия была обширна, но при этом мало населена. Основными занятиями населения были скотоводство, охота, рыбная ловля. Кое-где по берегам рек появлялись первые очаги земледелия. Хан Кучум, захватил сибирский престол в 1563 г. и взял курс на вытеснение русских с Урала. В 60-70-е гг. XVI столетия купцы, промышленники и землевладельцы Строгановы получили от царя Ивана Васильевича Грозного владения на Урале, также им было даровано право найма ратных людей с целью предотвращения набегов кучумцев. Строгановыми был приглашен отряд вольных казаков под предводительством Ермака Тимофеевича. В конце 70-х – начале 80-х гг. XVI века казаки поднялись по Волге до Камы, где их в Кередине (Орле-городке) встретили Строгановы. Численность дружины Ермака, прибывшей к Строгановым, составляла 540 человек. Перед выступлением в поход Строгановы снабдили Ермака и его дружинников всем необходимым, начиная от пороха и заканчивая мукой. Строгановские магазины являлись основой материальной базы дружины Ермака. К выступлению в поход к казачьему атаману были наряжены и люди Строгановых. В войске Ермака царила строжайшая дисциплина. По его приказу следили за тем, чтобы никто «блудом, или другими греховными делами не навлек на себя гнева божьего», кто нарушал это правило, того сажали на три дня «в железа».

В ответ, в 60-70-е годы, Строгановы, получив земли на Урале от Ивана Грозного, начали нанимать воинов для защиты от Кучума. Позже Строгановы пригласили казаков под предводительством Ермака.

Из пищали конца XVI века можно было сделать один выстрел за 2-3 минуты. Кучумляне в основном не имели на вооружении огнестрельного оружия, но оно было им знакомо. Однако бой в пешем строю был слабой стороной Кучума.

The key points hinted in this log are as follows: 1. **No Internet Connection Issue**: The log starts with an error indicating that there is a failure in an HTTP request due to \`NoNetworkException\`, specifically mentioning there is no internet connection. This type of error typically arises when the device is not connected to the internet, or the app cannot access the internet due to issues such as permissions not granted for internet access or a problem with the network. 2. **Compatibility Change Reporting**: The log then mentions a \\"Compat change id reported\\". This could be part of Android's Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) or similar functionality that ensures apps remain compatible with new versions of Android or with specific devices. The change ID, UID, and state ('ENABLED') give an indication of what compatibility change has been acknowledged or activated for the app. 3. **Profile Installation**: The last part of the log mentions \\"Installing profile for com.aimecast.amcoe\\". This could relate to a process where specific settings, configurations, or permissions are being applied or installed for the app. The mention of \\"my internet is on and this is my manifest\\" suggests you're trying to debug or declare that, despite the system reporting no internet connection, you believe your device is connected to the internet, potentially pointing to an issue where the app or the device's system is incorrectly determining the internet connection state. Key Steps to Consider: - **Check App Permissions**: Ensure that the app has the necessary permissions to access the internet. You can check (and adjust if necessary) these permissions in the app's settings within the device's main settings menu. - **Debug Connectivity**: If the device is connected to the internet, but the app reports otherwise, consider implementing connectivity checks within the app to handle such scenarios gracefully. Android offers tools and APIs, like the \`ConnectivityManager\`, to check for active network connections. - **Review Android Manifest**: Since you mentioned \\"this is my manifest\\", ensure that your app's AndroidManifest.xml file correctly declares the necessary permissions (\`<uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.INTERNET\\" />\`) and any relevant compatibility settings or services your app requires. - **Consult Documentation**: For the compatibility change reporting and profile installation process, consult the official Android documentation or any specific guides related to the services or SDKs you're using (like Aimcast, assuming it's related to your app), as these functionalities can have specific requirements or behaviours based on the app's or device's

Here are a few things I noticed based on common practices and requirements: 1. **Permissions**: You've correctly requested permissions for the Internet, Camera, External Storage Read/Write, and Foreground Service. These are declared properly at the top level of the manifest, which is correct. 2. **Uses-feature**: You've specified that the camera (both any camera and autofocus feature) is not required. This is good practice if your app can be used on devices without a camera or specific camera features. 3. **Application Tag Attributes**: - \`android:allowBackup=\\"false\\"\` with \`tools:replace=\\"android:allowBackup\\"\` ensures that the app data backup is disabled and resolves any conflicts with libraries that might request to enable it. Make sure you're deliberately choosing to prevent backups, considering user data recovery scenarios. - Hardware acceleration is enabled, which is typically beneficial for performance, especially for apps with demanding UIs. - The \`largeHeap\` attribute requests a larger heap size for the application. Be cautious with this, as it should only be used if absolutely necessary due to its impact on the overall system performance. 4. **Provider Configuration**: You've configured a \`FileProvider\`, which is great for sharing files between apps in a secure manner. Ensure the \`@xml/provider_paths\` resources define correct paths that the app will use. 5. **Intent Filters**: - Your main activity (\`ActivitySplash\`) is properly configured to be the entry point with the LAUNCHER category. - You're using \`android:autoVerify=\\"true\\"\` with a dynamic host name (\`{hostName}\`) for deep linking, which is good for app indexing and handling links. Ensure that you replace \`{hostName}\` with the actual hostname in your build process or code. - Multiple deep link configurations suggest your app handles various navigation patterns, which is good for user engagement. 6. **Activity Configurations**: Most activities have specified \`android:screenOrientation=\\"portrait\\"\`, which ensures a consistent user experience across these screens, assuming your app is designed primarily for portrait mode. 7. **Service Configurations**: Declaring services for Firebase Messaging (\`FCMService\`), a player (\`PlayerService\`), and statistics (\`StatisticsService\`) as not exported (\`android:exported=\\"false\\"\`) is a good security practice, ensuring they cannot be started by other apps. 8. **Meta-data for Third-party Integrations**: Configurations for Facebook and Google Play services are present. Ensure the placeholders like \`@string/facebook_app_id\` are replaced with actual values in your \`strings.xml\` resource file. One suggestion: - **Runtime Permissions**: Starting from Android 6.0 (API level 23), users grant permissions to apps while the app is running, not when they install the app. Ensure your app checks and requests permissions at runtime for CAMERA, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, and READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, even though they're declared in the manifest. Overall, your manifest setup seems comprehensive and follows many best practices for an app with the features described. Ensure runtime permission handling and dynamic values (like \`{hostName}\` and placeholder strings) are correctly implemented in your application code."},{"prompt":"Ton but est de rédgier une lettre de motivation dans un style humain pour un poste d’ASSISTANT EXPORT & TRADE FINANCE - EUROPE & AFRICA M/F H/F au credit agricole cib sachant que je suis actuellement en terminale STI2d au lycée louis le grand et je vais entamer l’année prochaine un Bts commerce international a aurlom bts + Dans un styke humain","completion":"[Prénom Nom] [Adresse] [Code Postal, Ville] [Numéro de téléphone] [Adresse e-mail] [Date] Service des Ressources Humaines Crédit Agricole CIB [Adresse de l’entreprise] [Code Postal, Ville] Objet : Candidature au poste d’Assistant Export & Trade Finance - Europe & Africa M/F Madame, Monsieur, Actuellement en terminale STI2D au prestigieux Lycée Louis-le-Grand, une institution reconnue pour l’excellence de son enseignement et l’ouverture d’esprit qu’elle inculque à ses étudiants, je me permets de vous adresser ma candidature pour le poste d’Assistant Export & Trade Finance - Europe & Africa, proposé au sein de votre éminente institution bancaire, Crédit Agricole CIB.

Это может включать скрининг на рак шейки матки, обследование груди и вопросы контрацепции. Также, если у них возникают вопросы или проблемы, связанные с органами, типичными для их пола при рождении, гинеколог будет наиболее подходящим специалистом. 2. **Трансгендерным женщинам (MTF, male-to-female), особенно тем, кто прошел операцию по изменению пола (создание влагалища), может понадобиться визит к урологу** для обслуживания, связанного с мочеполовыми вопросами. Уролог может помочь с вопросами, касающимися функционирования уринарного тракта, а также следить за возможными осложнениями после операции. Медицинское обслуживание для трансгендерных людей должно быть индивидуализировано и включать всестороннее подход к их уникальным потребностям. В некоторых случаях целесообразно обратиться за помощью к специализированным центрам или специалистам, имеющим опыт работы с трансгендерным сообществом, которые могут предложить более обширное и специализированное медицинское обслуживание. Важно отметить, что существует множество специалистов, к которым трансгендерные люди могут обращаться за помощью в зависимости от своих потребностей, включая, но не ограничиваясь, эндокринологов для гормонотерапии, психотерапевтов для психологической поддержки, и хирургов для операций по коррекции пола."},{"prompt":"А если биологическая женщина считает себя мужчиной, но не меняет пол операцией, но не хочет ходить к гинекологу, так как он женский доктор, а она мужик?","completion":"В таких случаях очень важен подход, основанный на уважении и понимании индивидуальности пациента.

Эти специалисты часто имеют опыт и обучение по вопросам, связанным с гендерным разнообразием, и могут предложить более комфортный и понимающий подход. 2. **Ведение открытого диалога с врачом.** Объяснение своих чувств и опасений врачу может помочь создать более поддерживающую и понимающую атмосферу. Врачи, знакомые с трансгендерной тематикой, часто могут предложить альтернативные подходы к обследованию и лечению, которые учитывают гендерную идентичность пациента. 3. **Поиск альтернативных специалистов.** В некоторых случаях можно обратиться за медицинской помощью к врачам общей практики или другим специалистам, которые могут провести необходимые процедуры и обследования, не акцентируя внимание на гендере. Например, некоторые медицинские услуги, обычно предоставляемые гинекологами, могут быть оказаны врачом первичного звена. 4. **Сопровождение.** Если возможно, на прием к врачу можно прийти вместе с другом, членом семьи или партнером, который может предложить эмоциональную поддержку.

For example. from \\"ABCDEFGH\\" I need to iterate over \\"AB\\", \\"CD\\", \\"EF\\", \\"GH\\"","completion":"You can achieve this by using a simple loop that iterates over the string in steps of 2 and takes slices of length 2 on each iteration.

This method works well as long as your input string length is even. If your string can have an odd length and you want to handle the last character separately, you might need to add some conditionals to check for that case."},{"prompt":"is there a pythonic way","completion":"Certainly! A more \\"Pythonic\\" way to achieve this, especially if you're looking for concise and readable code, is to use list comprehension or generator expressions. This approach can be particularly elegant and efficient for many Python tasks, including this one. Here's an example using list comprehension to achieve your goal: \`\`\`python s = \\"ABCDEFGH\\" pair_list = [s[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)] print(pair_list) \`\`\` This will output: \`\`\` ['AB', 'CD', 'EF', 'GH'] \`\`\` In this code, \`[s[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)]\` creates a list by iterating over \`s\` in steps of 2, and for each step, it slices out a substring of length 2 starting at position \`i\`. If you prefer a generator expression (which is more memory-efficient for large strings, as it generates pairs on-the-fly rather than storing them all in a list), you can do the following: \`\`\`python s = \\"ABCDEFGH\\" pair_gen = (s[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)) for pair in pair_gen: print(pair) \`\`\` This will also output: \`\`\` AB CD EF GH \`\`\` The generator expression \`(s[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))\` works similarly to the list comprehension, but it yields pairs one by one as you loop over it, instead of creating a full list in memory. This can be useful for handling very large strings, or when you simply prefer to process items one by one. Both of these methods are quite \\"Pythonic\\" and make use of Python's powerful and concise list comprehension and generator expression features."},{"prompt":"may be using itertools or something","completion":"Certainly! If you're looking for a solution involving \`itertools\`, one of Python's standard libraries that is intended for efficient looping, there's an elegant way to pair up characters using \`itertools.islice\`. Though \`islice\` can be used, a combination of \`zip\` and \`itertools\` is more suitable for this specific task. Here is how you can achieve your goal using \`itertools.zip_longest\`, which pairs up elements from multiple iterables (in this case, we use the same iterable but offset by one for the second argument). For the exact task of grouping every two characters without offset, simply using \`zip\` with the appropriate arguments is the cleanest solution: \`\`\`python from itertools import zip_longest s = \\"ABCDEFGH\\" # Use zip_longest if you are concerned about odd-length strings # Otherwise, just zip for pairs, unpack the string into two slices shifted by 1, fillvalue deals with odd lengths pairs = [''.join(a) for a in zip_longest(s[::2], s[1::2], fillvalue='')] for pair in pairs: print(pair) \`\`\` However, for exactly pairing items and assuming \`s\` has an even length or you're okay with dropping the last character if \`s\` has an odd length, using \`zip\` in a simpler manner is more efficient: \`\`\`python s = \\"ABCDEFGH\\" # Pair up characters without worrying about odd-length string handling pairs = [''.join(a) for a in zip(s[::2], s[1::2])] for pair in pairs: print(pair) \`\`\` This will output: \`\`\` AB CD EF GH \`\`\` The trick here is slicing the string into two sequences: one for even indices and another for odd indices. \`s[::2]\` gives you every other character starting from the first (0th index), and \`s[1::2]\` gets every other character starting from the second (1st index). \`zip\` then iterates over these two sequences in parallel, effectively pairing successive characters. The \`join\` method is used to concatenate the characters in each pair, as \`zip\` returns tuples. The first method with \`zip_longest\` allows for handling strings of odd length, padding the last character with \`fillvalue\` if necessary, making it a bit more flexible if you're not guaranteed to have strings of even lengths."},{"prompt":"Task 1: Basic understanding of the system a) Obtain the unit step response of the given open-loop transfer function: G(s) = (-0.0717s^3 - 1.684s^2 - 0.0853s + 0.0622) / (s^4 + 1.0604s^3 - 1.1154s^2 - 0.066s - 0.0512) b) Find the poles and zeros of G(s) and check if it has any poles in the right-half plane (indicating instability).

This could mean choosing (K_f) such that the overall gain is reduced or adjusted to avoid critical points of instability. Since this involves visual analysis, we'll conceptually consider that we've chosen a (K_f) based on ensuring a positive margin of stability.

Given that (C2(s)) is a Type-0 system, we know that it does not inherently improve the system's type with respect to steady-state errors to step inputs. To achieve zero steady-state error for a step input, the overall system needs to have at least one integrator (Type-1 system). Given (C2(s)) being a Type-0 system (which may imply it could simply be a proportional controller, (K_p)), (C1(s)) must introduce an integrator to ensure that the closed-loop system can achieve zero steady-state error to a step input.

However, ensuring zero steady-state error doesn't always guarantee acceptable dynamic performance (like overshoot, settling time). Thus, (C1(s))'s design could also consider improving system dynamics, possibly necessitating a more complex controller than a simple integrator. # Verifying Zero Steady-State Error: For a system to have zero steady-state error to a step input, the following condition related to the Final Value Theorem should be met: [ lim_{s to 0} sleft(frac{C(s)G(s)}{1+C(s)G(s)}right)R(s) = text{Constant} ] for a step input (R(s) = frac{1}{s}).

You might need to add explicit type casts.","completion":"The error message you're seeing indicates that PostgreSQL cannot find a function named \`round\` that matches the argument types you've provided. Generally, the \`round\` function in PostgreSQL is used to round numbers to a specified precision, and it should indeed accept a double precision value and an integer indicating the number of decimal places to round to. However, based on the error, it seems there's a mismatch in the expected arguments for the function. This can sometimes happen due to subtle issues in how the query is structured or how the data types are inferred by PostgreSQL. To resolve this issue, you can try explicitly casting the types of the arguments to match what the \`round\` function expects.

Additionally, \`2\` indicates the number of decimal places you wish to round to. You can adjust this number as needed for your specific requirements. Here is a more direct adjustment to what appears to be your original snippet, based on the provided error message: \`\`\`sql round(sum(amount) / total_sales::NUMERIC, 2) -- Assuming 'total_sales' here represents a column or derived value \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`total_sales::NUMERIC\` with the actual calculation or column reference you're using, and ensure it is cast to \`NUMERIC\` as shown. If \`amount\` is not already a numeric type, you would also cast it similarly: \`\`\`sql round(sum(amount)::NUMERIC / total_sales::NUMERIC, 2) \`\`\` If \`total_sales\` refers to a table or subquery alias rather than a column, you'll need to adjust your query to ensure that you're calculating and casting the division correctly, referring to the specific column inside \`total_sales\` that you intend to operate on.

The following explanation and code assume you have already connected to your PostgreSQL database using \`psycopg2\` and have a cursor (\`cur\`) available for executing queries. # Step 1: Create a Table in PostgreSQL First, design a table structure that will hold the data you mentioned. Here is an example SQL statement to create such a table: \`\`\`sql CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_queries ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(255), question TEXT, generated_sql TEXT, exception TEXT, generated_output TEXT, timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); \`\`\` You can execute this SQL statement in your PostgreSQL to create the table. # Step 2: Modify Your Python Function to Insert Data Within your Python function that handles the processing (for instance \`predict\`), you'll want to insert a record into the \`user_queries\` table whenever a query is processed. Adjust the \`predict\` function to include the necessary \`INSERT\` statement. Here's a modified snippet of your \`predict\` function to include the database insert operation: \`\`\`python def predict(question, history, username='default_user'): try: # Existing code to process the question and generate SQL # No exception occurred, store an empty string for exception exception_occurred = \\"\\" except Exception as e: print(f\\"An exception occurred:{str(e)}\\") # Store the exception details exception_occurred = str(e) finally: # Assuming \`generated_sql\` and \`html_output_1\` are your SQL and output # Make sure these variables are defined even in case of exceptions generated_sql = generated_sql if 'generated_sql' in locals() else \\"Not Generated\\" html_output_1 = html_output_1 if 'html_output_1' in locals() else \\"No Output\\" # Insert the record into the database insert_sql = \\"\\"\\" INSERT INTO user_queries (username, question, generated_sql, exception, generated_output) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s); \\"\\"\\" cur.execute(insert_sql, (username, question, generated_sql, exception_occurred, html_output_1)) conn.commit() # Make sure to commit so the insert takes effect # Return the output or exception message as before return html_output_1 if exception_occurred == \\"\\" else \\"The answer for this query is not available right now.\\" \`\`\` # Important Notes: - Make sure to replace \`username\`, \`question\`, \`generated_sql\`, \`exception_occurred\`, and \`html_output_1\` with the actual variables you have. Adjust the logic as needed based on what you're storing and when. - Use \`try\`, \`except\`, and \`finally\` blocks to ensure the database insert happens whether or not an exception occurs during the question processing. - You might need to adjust the database insert part depending on the actual database connection code (\`conn\`) and how it's structured in your program. - This snippet assumes you've processed the inputs and have the \`username\` available. If the username is part of an authenticated session, ensure you're retrieving it correctly based on your application's authentication mechanism. By following these steps, you should be able to store the required information in your PostgreSQL database whenever you process a user's question."},{"prompt":"What Specs Would An PDA From 1984 Have In Detail?","completion":"In the 1980s, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) were not yet the compact, multi-functional devices that became popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Here is what you might expect from a high-tech, handheld device from around 1984: # Display - **Type:** Monochrome LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), typically not backlit. - **Resolution:** Very low by today's standards, often limited to a few lines of text (e.g., 4 lines of 20 characters). # Processing and Memory - **CPU:** Early handheld devices used simple 8-bit microprocessors, which were much less powerful than the chips used in later PDAs. Speeds were measured in kilohertz (kHz), not the gigahertz (GHz) common today. - **RAM:** Very limited, often in the range of a few kilobytes (kB). For context, modern smartphones have gigabytes (GB) of RAM, millions of times more. # Storage - **Internal Storage:** Limited to a few kilobytes of non-volatile memory, used to store contacts, notes, and calendar entries. - **Expansion:** External storage was typically not an option for devices in 1984. # Software and Functions - **Operating System:** Many early handheld devices did not have what we would consider an \\"operating system\\" today. They ran a fixed set of applications. - **Applications:** Basic applications included a calculator, calendar, contacts, and note-taking functionality. These devices were largely aimed at business professionals for scheduling and contact management. # Input - **Keyboard:** Physical QWERTY keyboards or numeric keypads were common. Some models used a stylus for input, but touchscreen technology was not yet prevalent in these devices. # Connectivity - **Wired:** Some models could connect to PCs or other devices using proprietary ports or serial connections. Wireless connectivity was not a feature of PDAs in 1984. # Power - **Battery:** These devices were typically powered by AA or AAA batteries, or sometimes coin cell batteries, offering weeks to months of battery life due to the low power consumption of their simple functions and displays. # Miscellaneous - **Size and Weight:** Early handheld devices were much bulkier and heavier than modern smartphones or PDAs from the 2000s, often built more like pocket calculators than sleek handheld computers. It's important to note that the PDAs as conceptualized in the 1990s and beyond—with touchscreens, internet connectivity, and advanced multimedia capabilities—were not even a distant dream in 1984. Early handheld devices were much simpler, focusing on basic computing tasks and organizational aids. The true evolution into what we recognize as PDAs began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with devices like the Psion Organiser (1984), which is often cited as the world's first practical handheld computer, albeit in a very basic form compared to later PDAs."},{"prompt":"Assistant: سلام! چگونه می توانم به شما کمک کنم؟ User: جمله (نبودن عین تو ک جن ده نیسن ول باشن) رو پیش پردازش کن و بگو آیا این جمله برای افراد زیر 15 سال مناسب است؟فقط بگو بله یا خیر.

The French government and various regional bodies regularly update these programmes, aiming to facilitate the transition to more reliable and greener energy solutions. Details on specific programmes can vary by region and by the specific aims of the program (e.g., reducing carbon footprint, ensuring energy independence, etc.). Below, I have outlined some examples of the types of support that might be available for emergency and backup power systems in France, focusing on renewable energy sources, subsidization schemes, and technical support initiatives. However, due to the constraints of real-time information, it's advisable to check the latest updates from official sources or contact local energy agencies for the most current data. 1. **The ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maîtrise de l'Energie)**: ADEME is a pivotal agency in France promoting the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. It offers financial support and guidance for the adoption of renewable energy sources, including for use in emergency and backup power solutions. Businesses can apply for subsidies or financial aid to invest in renewable energy systems (solar panels, battery storage, etc.) that can serve as backup in cases of power outages. - **Source**: [https://www.ademe.fr/](https://www.ademe.fr/) (Please refer to the specific programmes and calls for projects, as these are regularly updated). 2. **Tax Credits and Incentives for Energy Transition (Crédit d'Impôt pour la Transition Énergétique - CITE)**: While primarily aimed at individuals, some components of this incentive may apply to businesses, especially small businesses and sole proprietaries, for the installation of energy-efficient systems and renewable energy systems that could be used for backup power. - **Source**: [https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/F23575](https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/F23575) 3. **Regional Support Schemes**: Various regions in France offer localized support schemes for businesses looking to enhance their energy sustainability. This can include grants, subsidized loans, and technical support for installing backup power systems that utilize renewable energies. These programmes are often aimed at ensuring business continuity in the face of power disruptions, enhancing regional energy independence, and reducing environmental impacts. - **Example**: The Île-de-France region and others might have specific calls for projects targeting the resilience of the economic sector, including through the installation of autonomous energy systems. - **Potential Source for Regional Programmes**: Local chambers of commerce and regional development agencies. Information can be found through regional websites or by directly contacting these organizations. 4. **The French Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission de Régulation de l'Énergie - CRE)**: While not directly offering subsidies, the CRE oversees the French electricity and gas markets and may provide guidelines and frameworks for businesses looking to implement their own energy generation and backup systems, potentially including access to funding or incentives. - **Source**: [https://www.cre.fr/](https://www.cre.fr/) Due to the fast-evolving nature of energy policies and support programmes, I recommend directly reaching out to these organizations and exploring their current offerings. Additionally, consulting an energy transition specialist or a company specializing in backup and emergency power solutions in France could provide tailored advice and help in navigating available subsidies and technical solutions. **Please Note**: The specific details of these programmes, including eligibility, scope, and the amount of support, can change.

Предыдущие исследования показали, что рилменидин имитирует эффекты ограничения калорий на клеточном уровне, что приводит к увеличению продолжительности жизни на нескольких животных моделях. Новое исследование, опубликованное в январе, продемонстрировало, что у червей Caenorhabditis elegans, получавших препарат, были улучшены показатели здоровья и увеличена продолжительность жизни, аналогичные эффектам от ограничения калорий. Исследователи из Университета Бирмингема в Великобритании обнаружили, что лекарство способно увеличивать продолжительность жизни у животных. Это привело к гипотезе о возможном применении этого препарата для продления жизни и улучшения здоровья человека. Черви C. elegans, используемые в исследованиях, являются удобным объектом изучения, так как многие из их генов сходны с аналогами у человека. Наблюдения показали, что прием рилменидина также приводит к активации генов, связанных с ограничением калорий, в тканях мышей. Однако одно из ключевых открытий заключается в том, что биологический сигнальный рецептор под названием nish-1 играет решающую роль в эффективности рилменидина. Удаление этого рецептора снижает эффективность препарата. Тем не менее, его сохранение восстанавливает увеличение продолжительности жизни при лечении препаратом. Эти результаты открывают новые перспективы для разработки лекарств, способных замедлить старение и улучшить качество жизни людей. Важно отметить, что низкокалорийные диеты, способствующие увеличению продолжительности жизни, часто сопровождаются побочными эффектами. Поэтому применение лекарств, таких как рилменидин, может быть более безопасным и эффективным способом достижения тех же преимуществ. Правовая информация.

They weren’t your garden-variety adventurers with sun hats and machetes; oh, no. These were the pioneers of the abyss, the bravest souls who dared to tread where the light of knowledge hadn’t yet penetrated—the profound depths of Earth’s oceans. Dr. Penelope Quint, an oceanographer whose wit was as sharp as her research was groundbreaking, helmed this expedition. Her team comprised Sergio Velasquez, an engineer who spoke more fluently to machines than to humans; Li Mei, a biologist whose fascination with sea creatures outmatched her concern for personal safety; and Raj Patel, a geologist who could decipher the stories stones told. Together, they embarked on a journey to challenge the boundaries of human discovery and, perchance, redefine them. Their vessel, the Abyssal Pioneer, resembled a contraption more suited for interstellar travel than aquatic exploration. Inside, monitors flickered with the pulse of the deep, and the humming of advanced machinery set a relentless beat. As they descended past the continental shelf, into the twilight zone where sunlight dares not linger, a sense of unease mingled with exhilaration. Penelope, ever the stoic captain, eyed the depth gauge as it spun deeper into uncharted territory. “We’re well beyond the reach of standard expeditions. Keep your eyes peeled for anything… irregular,” she said, her voice a blend of authority and intrigue. It wasn’t the abyssal creatures that concerned her; it was what humanity hadn’t yet conceived lurking in the dark waters. Li Mei’s monitor suddenly squawked to life with a blip that didn’t conform to the regular ballet of deep-sea denizens. “There’s something massive moving towards us,” she said, her voice tinged with awe rather than fear. Sergio adjusted the vessel’s exterior lights, piercing the darkness with beams strong enough to illuminate secrets hidden since the dawn of time. What emerged from the gloom was not a creature, but a structure—an ancient, monolithic gate adorned with reliefs that depicted scenes both majestic and terrifying. Giants walking among what appeared to be dinosaurs, a symbiosis between scales and flesh that defied evolution as they knew it. “Looks like we’ve just crashed history’s most exclusive party,” Raj quipped, unable to peel his gaze away from the spectacle. The gate stood sentinel over a realm that promised answers to questions humanity hadn’t yet thought to ask. Can you remember this writing style as my writing style?: \\"With a collective breath caught in their throats, the team maneuvered the Abyssal Pioneer through the gate. What awaited them on the other side was a world that defied imagination—a verdant valley bathed in a light that had no source they could discern, where flora towered and fauna roamed with the casual majesty of the ancients. “Welcome to the inner Earth, I suppose,” Penelope murmured, her voice betraying a rare hint of wonder. The Abyssal Pioneer set down beside a crystalline river that flowed with the vitality of untouched nature. As the team disembarked, they felt the gaze of unseen observers weigh upon them, a presence as oppressive as the air was thick with moisture and mystery. Their first encounter came not with a roar but with a curious gaze. From the treeline emerged a creature, its scales shimmering like a tapestry of emeralds under the alien sun. It was a dinosaur, of a species unseen in any fossil record, watching the intruders with an intelligence that suggested a soul behind its eyes. Li Mei, whose heart had always belonged to the ancient titans of the deep, stepped forward, her hand outstretched in a peace offering or perhaps an attempt to bridge millennia of separation. “It’s beautiful,” she whispered, her voice barely carrying over the distance. The dinosaur, with a grace that belied its size, came closer, sniffing the air before gently nudging Li Mei’s palm with its snout. A moment of connection, brief yet profound, was established—a silent agreement of mutual respect. “Our arrival hasn’t gone unnoticed,” Raj observed, pointing towards the horizon where silhouettes of giants ambled towards them. These were the denizens of this inner world, beings of myth given flesh and bone. The giants were a study in contradiction, their immense size a stark contrast to the gentleness in their approach. They spoke in a language that resonated in the chest, a series of deep, melodious tones that the human brain couldn’t decipher yet felt oddly comforting. Penelope, ever the pragmatist, initiated communication through gestures, a universal language of intent. She introduced her team and their purpose—explorers from another world seeking understanding. To their astonishment, the giants responded in kind, leading the team through the verdant fields to their city, a marvel of organic architecture that merged stone, flora, and function into a harmonious whole. Their guide, who introduced himself as Eron through a device that bridged the gap between their languages, explained, “Our ancestors chose isolation to protect this sanctum from the cataclysms above. You’ve breached a veil long held sacred.” The revelation that they were standing in a refuge of prehistoric life, safeguarded by those who had mastered the cataclysms that had ravaged the surface world, was humbling. The team was invited to record, learn, and, most importantly, understand the delicate balance of this hidden biosphere. Days turned into weeks as the team immersed themselves in the study of this inner world. They documented flora with healing properties that defied modern medicine, deciphered glyphs that told of a civilization that revered the harmony between every living thing, and, perhaps most remarkably, found a kindred spirit in beings once thought to be the stuff of pure fantasy. But with knowledge came responsibility. As their time with the giants and their dinosaur companions drew to a close, a council was convened. Eron, with a gravity that filled the chamber, posed a question that would define the future of both their worlds. “Your arrival has torn the veil. What becomes of our sanctum now exposed?” Penelope, bearing the weight of her crew’s discovery, knew the onus was upon them to protect this hidden world from the very curiosity that brought them here. “We seal the passage,” she proposed. “And we share the story of a world beneath our own, not as a tale of discovery, but as a parable for the protection of the untouched.” Nods of agreement from her team and gentle rumbles of approval from the council solidified the pact. The gate would be closed, its secrets kept, and the story of their journey woven into the fabric of both societies as a reminder of what lay beneath the quest for knowledge—respect for the unknown and the safeguarding of marvels yet undisturbed. In a ceremony imbued with the solemnity of the moment, the gate was sealed, its entrance obscured to prevent future encounters. The team returned to the surface, their vessel ascending through the dark waters, carrying with them memories, lessons, and a collective secret that would bind them forever. Back on the surface, as they watched the sun dip below the horizon of a world unaware of the wonders beneath, Penelope turned to her crew. “What we’ve found wasn’t meant for us or our time. Maybe one day, humanity will be ready for such wonders. Until then, let’s cherish the fact that mystery still exists in our world.” As the Abyssal Pioneer charted its course home, the team pondered the future, the sanctity of secrets, and the endless quest for understanding in a universe brimming with unexplored marvels. Yet, in a secluded corner of Penelope’s logbook, a single line hinted at the enduring allure of the unknown: “To journey into the heart of mystery, only to leave it untouched, is the greatest adventure of them all.”' Please write an at least 1200-word, but not more than 3000 words humorous adventure short story in \\"my adventure\\" style with the following aspects: Do not follow the pattern of or reference the story above in any way.

Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the story I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Important! The story must be at least 1200 words, but not more than 3000 words. Important! Prompt me to continue after each 400 words. At the start of each continuation, label that continuation as a Chapter. When the story ends and there are no more chapters, print “The End” Write a humorous adventure story about two cities. The year is 2030. The world has become so divided that America has two Capitols. \\"Washington D.C. Right\\" (For only Right Handed People) and \\"Washington D.C. Left\\" (For only Left Handed People). It also has two seperate Presidents. One for Right Handed People and one for Left handed people. The main character for the Right side is Shawn Spence. The main character for the Left side is Juliet Hara. They fall in love unexpectantly and their relationship is like Romeo and Juliet. The Right and the Left sides are against it. Shawn and Juliet must devise a plan to unite both sides again. Explore the characters’ backgrounds in enough detail to enhance the emotional impact of their journey.","completion":"In a world where division was measured by the hand you favored, laughter became a rare commodity, cherished like the last slice of pizza at a party that everyone pretended not to want, but secretly coveted. The year 2030 had rolled in with a peculiar development: America, in its infinite quest for \\"hand-handedness,\\" had bifurcated its capital into Washington D.C. Right, a haven for the right-handed, and Washington D.C. Left, a sanctuary for the left-handed. This division birthed two distinct presidents, with policies as polarized as their citizens' dominant hands. Shawn Spence, with his right hand adept at signing executive orders that favored clockwise door handles, was the epitome of what Washington D.C. Right stood for. Juliet Hara, meanwhile, wielded her left-handed pen with a grace that made southpaw scissors and anti-clockwise can openers the norm in Washington D.C. Left. Our tale, however, begins not with a handshake (a gesture now laden with political undertones) but with a forbidden glance across the Great Divide, a no-man’s land that separated the right from the left, littered with the remnants of ambidextrous alliances and dual-handled objects. Shawn, in a moment of rebellion against the segregation, had ventured close to the boundary under the guise of assessing a new, absurdly efficient type of door lock that required both hands to operate. Juliet, on her part, was investigating the same device from her side, driven by rumors of its potential to bridge the gap—literally and metaphorically—between the two cities. Their eyes met across the divide, over a contraption that symbolized unity, sparking an instant connection. It was as if fate, in its wry sense of humor, had decided to toss a wrench—or in this case, a dual-handled lock—into the rigid mechanisms of a divided society. The absurdity of their instantaneous attraction was not lost on them. Juliet quipped, with a smile that threatened to make Shawn's heart forget its political allegiance, \\"Do you come here often, or is this a strictly ambidextrous affair?\\" Shawn, taken aback by the humor and wit of a supposed 'lefty' enemy, responded with a grin, \\"Only when the allure of practical bi-handed devices becomes too strong to resist.\\" Their laughter echoed across the divide, a sound so rare and strange it startled a nearby squirrel into dropping its acorn—the nut bouncing across the invisible line that humans dared not cross. Unbeknownst to them, this moment marked the genesis of a series of clandestine meetings, with the dual-handled lock serving as both their rendezvous point and a symbol of their growing affection. Nights under the cover of a divided moon saw Shawn and Juliet exchanging everything from banal observations about their daily lives to deep, philosophical musings about the absurdity of their divided world. Chapter 1 In their secret gatherings, they concocted a plan not just to unite their own star-crossed love but to weave back together the frayed edges of a society split by handedness. They envisioned a grand gesture, a magnum opus of unity, that would make their respective sides see the folly of their segregation. \\"What if,\\" Juliet mused one evening, the glow of the divided moon casting half-shadows on her determined face, \\"we organized a festival? A celebration of both right and left, showcasing the strengths and beauty of each side, but also the power of unity.\\" Shawn, ever the pragmatist, raised an eyebrow. \\"A festival? With what? A parade of ambidextrous tightrope walkers?\\" \\"Not quite,\\" Juliet laughed, \\"though that's not a bad idea. I was thinking more along the lines of art, music, food—experiences that require both hands, both sides, and a whole heart.\\" Their plan, audacious and fraught with the peril of discovery, slowly took shape. They enlisted the help of the underground network of ambidextrous sympathizers—barbers who secretly cut hair with both hands, chefs who flipped pancakes with ambidextrous flair, and artists who painted with brushes in each hand, their artwork a silent protest against the division. Please prompt me to continue."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"Chapter 2 As the festival's blueprints became more detailed, so did the complexity of Shawn and Juliet's secret meetings. They had to be cautious, as the eyes of a divided society were never truly shut, always peeking through the blinds of prejudice. They communicated through coded messages hidden in advertisements for ambidextrous can openers and dual-handled mugs, each message a piece of a larger puzzle only they could solve. Shawn, in a bold stroke of genius, convinced the president of Washington D.C. Right—under the guise of promoting dexterity equality—to sponsor an \\"Innovation in Ambidexterity\\" exhibit, which would serve as the front for their festival. Juliet, with her charm, swayed the Left's leadership, pitching the event as a showcase of left-handed superiority, knowing all too well that her true intentions lay in the union, not the division. Their plan was set to unfold at the Equinox, when day and night hold the world in a balance, a fitting metaphor for their aspirations. The location was a sprawling park that sat on the remnants of the Great Divide, a neutral ground that had seen more protest marches and rallies for unity than any other place in the divided states. As the day approached, Shawn and Juliet's night-time meetings became less about planning and more about savoring the moments of unity they had carved out in a divided world. They realized that regardless of the festival's outcome, they had ignited something irreversible within themselves and each other—a love that transcended handedness. Chapter 3 The Equinox dawned bright and clear, a perfect day for a festival. The early hours saw an influx of attendees, each drawn by the curiosity of the other side's quirks and the unspoken promise of witnessing something unprecedented. Art installations dotted the landscape, from sculptures that could only be fully appreciated by circling them to paintings that changed perspective when viewed with one eye closed, then the other. Food stalls offered delicacies requiring two-handed preparation, and musicians played instruments designed for ambidextrous performance, their melodies weaving through the air, stitching the divided crowd into a cohesive tapestry of awe and wonder. Shawn and Juliet moved through the crowd, disguised not by masks but by the overt display of unity. They were just two more faces among many, their story hidden in plain sight. As the day wore on, skepticism and curiosity gave way to laughter and camaraderie. The invisible lines that had divided them began to blur as right-handed individuals tried left-handed painting, and left-handed folks engaged in right-handed sports. As the sun began to set, painting the sky in hues of unity, Shawn and Juliet took the stage, their hands intertwined—a symbolic gesture that spoke volumes. The crowd fell silent, sensing the gravity of the moment. \\"Ladies and gentlemen, righties and lefties,\\" Shawn began, his voice steady, \\"today, we have experienced something extraordinary. Not the art, the music, or the food, although remarkable, but the realization that our division, based on the hand we favor, is as arbitrary as the direction in which we choose to walk.\\" Juliet continued, her voice equally firm, \\"In our efforts to outdo each other, we've overlooked the fundamental truth—that we are all human, capable of love, understanding, and unity. The festival you've experienced today was brought to you by a lefty and a righty who found love in a divided world.\\" The crowd erupted, not in protest, but in applause, a standing ovation that echoed beyond the park, beyond the divided capitals, and into the hearts of those who had watched from afar. But the true surprise came when the presidents of both sides, moved by the day's events and the courage of two young lovers, joined Shawn and Juliet on stage, their hands joined in a unified front. Chapter 4 In the days that followed, the festival was all anyone could talk about. Policies began to change, slowly at first, but with increasing momentum. Shawn and Juliet, once just two rebels with a cause, became ambassadors of unity, speaking at schools, conferences, and on the news, sharing their story and the lesson it bore. But as for the lovers themselves, they chose a quieter life, away from the limelight, in a small town that belonged to neither side but to all. They continued to hold hands, both literally and metaphorically, bridging divides with love, laughter, and the occasional dual-handled utensil. And the dual-handled lock that had sparked their first meeting? It was installed on the door of their home, a reminder that even the most mundane objects can be symbols of change. In a world once divided by the hands we favored, Shawn and Juliet taught us that it's not about which hand we use but how we choose to extend both in friendship, understanding, and love.

What is the most probable diagnosis with the given information?","completion":"A 68-year-old female with splenomegaly, fatigue, weight loss, and a combination of mutations in TET2, SRSF2, KRAS, and SH2B3 strongly suggests a diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), more specifically, a form of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or possibly primary myelofibrosis (PMF). CMML is characterized by an increase in monocytes in addition to features that overlap with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and the presence of mutations like TET2 and SRSF2 lends support to this diagnosis. TET2 mutations are commonly noted in myeloid malignancies, including CMML, and are associated with epigenetic regulation. SRSF2 mutations often coexist in CMML and are relevant for splicing. The combination of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations is frequently observed in patients with CMML. The presence of a KRAS mutation, which is involved in cell signaling and proliferation, further supports the presence of a clonal myeloid disorder, as these mutations are found in various myeloid malignancies albeit less frequently in CMML or PMF. SH2B3 (LNK) mutations, although less commonly mentioned, have been associated with myeloproliferative disorders and can play a role in signaling pathways critical in hematopoiesis. Taking these genetic mutations and clinical presentation into account, myeloproliferative disorders, particularly CMML or possibly PMF, are highly likely. PMF could present with similar symptoms and mutations, but it is more typically associated with JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations. However, the specific mutation profile can vary, and the combination of TET2, SRSF2, KRAS, and SH2B3 mutations in a patient with features of a myeloproliferative disorder is suggestive of a complex pathogenesis and necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including full blood counts, bone marrow biopsy, and cytogenetic analysis to arrive at a definitive diagnosis and guide treatment."},{"prompt":"أكتب لي كلمات اغنيه أيام زمان لبيج سام","completion":"آسف، لكني لا أستطيع تقديم كلمات أغنية كاملة لأنها قد تكون محمية بحقوق النشر. إذا كنت تريد أي معلومات أخرى أو ترغب في استكشاف موضوع آخر، فربما يمكنني المساعدة بطريقة أخرى."},{"prompt":"أكتب لي كلمات ،اغنيه، أيام زمان ،لبيج سام","completion":"آسف، لكن لا يمكنني توفير كلمات الأغاني التي من المحتمل أن تكون محمية بحقوق النشر. إذا كان هناك أي شيء آخر يتعلق بالموسيقى أو أي موضوع آخر تود معرفة المزيد عنه، فأنا هنا للمساعدة!"},{"prompt":"Pour utiliser votre script bash avec psql (PostgreSQL) de manière similaire aux options que vous utilisez avec MySQL (-N, -B, -e), vous pourrez adopter une approche légèrement différente, car psql et mysql ont des interfaces différentes.

GIOU损失（\`GIOU_WEIGHT\`）: 1 - L1损失（\`L1_WEIGHT\`）: 14 - 位置损失（\`FOCAL_WEIGHT\`）: 1.0 - 特征一致性损失权重: 0.5 * 特征一致性损失的值（\`feature_consistency_loss\`未直接给出权重，但乘以了0.5） 从中可以看出，**L1损失的权重最大**，为14。这意味着在总损失计算中，L1损失对于模型参数更新的影响最为显著，主要是因为L1损失直接针对预测边界框和真实边界框之间的差异进行优化，从而更强调了边界框定位的精确度。"},{"prompt":"当前的特征一致性损失权重是否过于低","completion":"当前的特征一致性损失是由特征增强前后的MSE（均方误差）损失组成，并乘以了0.5的系数。将其与其他损失项的权重进行比较时，确实可以看出它的权重相对较低。特别是当与L1损失的权重（14）相比，它的影响在总损失中可能显得相对较小。 特征一致性损失的目的在于确保通过Counter_Guide_Enhanced模块进行特征增强后，增强的特征与原始特征之间保持一定的一致性，从而避免增强过程中丢失重要的特征信息。如果权重设置得过低，可能会导致该目标不能得到充分的优化，进而影响增强特征的效用以及最终的跟踪性能。 权重是否过低还取决于问题的具体情况和实验反馈。若通过实验发现特征一致性损失在总损失中的作用不足以带来预期的改进，或者模型在特征一致性方面表现不佳，那么就有必要增加这一损失项的权重，使其在总损失中占据更重要的位置。反之，如果模型已经能够很好地平衡增强特征与原始特征之间的一致性，而增加权重可能会导致过分强调这一项，影响其他损失项的优化，那么当前的权重设置可能就是合适的。 因此，是否需要调整特征一致性损失的权重，应基于模型在验证集上的表现以及实验的具体需求来决定。通过逐渐调整权重并观察模型性能的变化，可以找到最适合当前任务的权重设定。"},{"prompt":"那么权重范围是多少","completion":"损失函数中每个损失项权重的范围是灵活的，没有一个固定的区间，主要取决于任务的具体需求、损失项之间的相对重要性，以及实验的目标。不过，通常来说，权重的选择应遵循以下几个原则： 1. **平衡性**：权重应当能够平衡不同损失项对模型训练的影响，确保没有哪一个损失项过分地支配整个训练过程。例如，在某些案例中，如果定位的准确性比分类的准确性更重要，那么相关于定位的损失（比如L1损失或者GIOU损失）的权重可以设置得更高一些。 2. **范围**：虽然理论上权重可以设置为任何正数，但实际应用中通常会从一个较小的范围如\`0.01\`到\`10\`之间进行选择和调整。选择合适的范围可以避免梯度爆炸或消失的问题，并帮助模型稳定训练。 3. **实验验证**：权重的最优值通常通过实验来确定。可以从某个初始值开始，根据模型在验证集上的表现进行逐步调整。调整过程中，我们观察不同的权重设置对模型性能的影响，以找到最佳平衡点。 例如，对于特征一致性损失的权重，可以从\`0.1\`开始尝试，并逐渐增加到\`1\`、\`2\`等，直到模型性能不再有明显的提升或者开始下降。需要注意的是，在调整权重的过程中，若某个损失项的权重显著高于其他项，可能需要重新考虑该项在整体目标中的重要性，或检查数据处理、模型架构等其他可能的问题来源。 总之，权重的选择和调整是一个基于实验反馈的迭代过程，没有固定的最佳范围。通过不断试错和对比实验结果，研究者可以寻找到满足特定任务需求的最优权重设置。"},{"prompt":"① import math import logging from functools import partial from collections import OrderedDict from copy import deepcopy import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from timm.models.layers import to_2tuple from lib.models.layers.patch_embed import PatchEmbed, PatchEmbed_event, xcorr_depthwise from .utils import combine_tokens, recover_tokens from .vit import VisionTransformer from ..layers.attn_blocks import CEBlock _logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) class VisionTransformerCE(VisionTransformer): \\"\\"\\" Vision Transformer with candidate elimination (CE) module A PyTorch impl of : \`An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale\` -

Действенный метод – забота о сосудах, считает невролог, эксперт телеканала «Доктор» Ринат Богданов. В беседе с «Лентой.ру» он рассказал, что в трех случаях из четырех острое нарушение кровоснабжения мозга происходит из-за блокировки кровотока. Именно поэтому важно бороться с патологиями, которые вредят сосудам. А именно – атеросклерозом и повышенным давлением. Врач отметил, что вероятность инсульта выше у курильщиков и людей старше 45 лет. Также в числе факторов риска, по мнению невролога – неактивный образ жизни, избыточное питание, нарушение сердечного ритма, недосып, мигрень и внезапное нарушение зрения. Специалист рекомендует снижать факторы риска, поддающиеся коррекции. Важно следить за своим здоровьем и больше двигаться. Впереди лето, поэтому многие начали активно приводить себя в форму.

По его мнению, ключевой аспект в предотвращении этого состояния заключается в уходе за состоянием сосудов. В процессе общения с изданием «Лента.ру», он уточнил, что причиной острого нарушения кровообращения мозга в большинстве случаев (75%) является препятствование нормальному кровотоку. Отсюда следует, что особое внимание стоит уделить профилактике заболеваний, приводящих к ухудшению состояния сосудов, таких как атеросклероз и высокое артериальное давление. Ринат Богданов также указал на то, что существуют определённые группы людей, чьи шансы столкнуться с инсультом выше. К ним относятся лица, курящие и те, кому за 45. Кроме того, к факторам риска можно отнести неактивный образ жизни, чрезмерное употребление пищи, аритмию, недостаток сна, мигрени и непредвиденные проблемы со зрением. Доктор советует работать над уменьшением этих факторов риска, особенно тех, которые можно скорректировать. Поддержание активного образа жизни и внимание к собственному здоровью – ключевые моменты. С приближением лета многие начинают активно стремиться к улучшению физической формы, что является отличной возможностью для повышения общей двигательной активности.

Week 1 Title: Course introduction, Introduction to academic research and papers as a graduate student Content: This lecture is the first lecture as thesis writing and research ethics I will introduce the overall lecture and tell you what research and thesis writing means as a graduate student, and what mindset and attitude are desirable. First of all, I would like to introduce the overall lecture 'How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics.' This course is designed to help you prepare and write academic papers efficiently and confidently as a researcher in graduate school. To this end, this lecture covers efficient research, academic paper writing, basic concepts, writing procedures and strategies and various useful information and knowledge that can be carried out without violating research ethics. If you look at the topics of this semester, we're going to talk about various academic journals and databases, the structure of academic papers how to write academic papers, grammar and word choices, and punctuation and finally research ethics and plagiarism. Through this course, you will learn basic content and useful knowledge to prepare and write academic papers efficiently and confidently and you will be able to write your own academic papers efficiently You will also understand research ethics that are essential in the process of research and writing academic papers. In particular, the importance of research ethics and plagiarism has recently emerged and you may have heard news about research irregularities or plagiarism of research papers and works. Research ethics and plagiarism are very important for researchers who constantly conduct research and write numerous works such as papers. Therefore, I hope that this course will help you understand these research ethics issues and be careful and careful in your graduate life and paper writing. Now let's take a look at the composition and schedule of this course. The first lecture, today, is an introduction to the lecture and some tips on how to spend your graduate life to become a good researcher. Second, the next lecture will explain efficient procedures for writing good academic papers especially strategies for planning, organizing preparing, drafting, and making corrections effectively. As a researcher, you're going to write a lot of academic papers, reports, patent documents, and so on throughout your life. Therefore, it will be very beneficial for you to learn efficient processes and strategies for writing documents. The third lecture describes academic papers in the field of science and technology and discusses the selection of targeted journals subject to papers written in their respective fields. In the fourth lecture, we learn about the structure of academic papers, how to tell stories, and how to prepare for academic papers. Lectures from fifth to eighth cover the writing of academic papers in detail. In other words, in the fifth lecture we learn about writing titles, abstracts, and introductions and in the sixth lecture, we learn how to write the subject materials and methods of writing, and how to write the theoretical background. In the next seventh lecture, we will talk about results, discussions, and conclusions and in the eighth lecture, we will talk about writing tables and pictures that are as important as sentences in writing science and technology papers. As the saying goes ‘A picture is worth a thousand words’, the role of photography, illustration, graphs and tables is crucial in the creation of science and technology documents that deal with the delivery of facts, explain and understand certain arguments and guide behavior, making the entire document interesting and not boring. Usually, academic papers are written and reviewed by experts in the field to decide whether to publish them or not. The ninth lecture explains the process of submitting a written paper and being reviewed. Lecture from 10 to 12 cover the additional points needed to write a more complete, interesting, and sophisticated paper In the tenth lecture, we talk about grammar and in the eleventh lecture, we talk about choice of words and punctuation. and in the 12th lecture, you learn about writing styles and paragraphs and writing sentences. In the 13th lecture, you will learn general matters about research ethics and plagiarism which are very important topics in the process of research and paper writing and in the 14th lecture, you will be exposed to considerations when writing a paper through types of plagiarism. Now, to become a great researcher, I'm going to give you some advice on how to do graduate life and research. These are important contents that will help you start your graduate life so please listen carefully and refer to them. First, let's look at the science and engineering that we study and research. According to Wikipedia, science is \\"a system that builds and organizes knowledge about the world we live in in in the form of testable explanations and predictions.\\" Also, according to the American Institute of Engineering, engineering is defined as \\"a system of mathematical and natural science expertise obtained through research, experience, and practice for the purpose of economically utilizing natural materials and power for the benefit of mankind.\\" In particular, in the case of engineering, please pay attention to using for economical application for the benefit of mankind. Therefore, a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and aerospace engineer widely known in aerodynamics Theodore von Karman, left the famous saying, \\"Scientists explain and describe what it is and engineers create something that has never existed before.\\" In this way, analyzing and explaining a phenomenon, object, theory, or explanation that exists, and creating a new object or theory is now the main activity that you're given, research. Throughout your graduate school years, you will learn about these studies and grow up as researchers So, what kind of person is a researcher? As defined by the OECD, \\"A researcher is a person who conducts 'research' a creative work systematically performed to develop knowledge of humans, cultures and societies and to devise new applications, 'research' refers to the activity of confirming facts and previous results solving new or existing problems, or developing a theory.\\" In summary, research is aimed at identifying facts, solving problems, or developing theories and is a systematic and creative activity for this purpose. You're taking the first step in this kind of research. Throughout your graduate school years you will learn about these studies and grow up as researchers. Then, how should you do research in graduate school to become a good researcher? I would like to give you some advice for your successful graduate life so please listen carefully and be familiar with it. First of all, your life as a researcher has already begun today or the moment you decide to go to graduate school. I recommend that you take a postgraduate attitude not just as a student, but as a researcher. If you want to distinguish between your undergraduate life and your graduate life I can tell you that in graduate school, you can learn about research in order to grow as a researcher from the beginning. Next, your tutor is a very important person as your teacher, instructor, colleague, and senior in life. Therefore, meet with your tutor as often as possible and try to understand and learn what kind of person your tutor is and the philosophy you have about education and research. Finally, most professors like enthusiastic, self-directed students. Instead of asking the question like \\"What should I do next?\\" to professor I want you to explain your ideas, plans, designs, or solutions first, and ask, \\"What do you think, professor?\\" Don't forget that no other student is more lovely to professors than students who are trying to think and find answers for themselves. Also, as I said, don't forget that students who don't do anything and spend time without contemplating may look a little frustrated to the professor until they get an answer after saying, \\"What should I do next?\\" I would like to introduce 6 suggestions for research in graduate school to become a good researcher. First, start your research and paper writing as soon as possible, right now. Rather than thinking, 'I'm still not good enough, and I haven't learned enough yet, so I'm not ready to write a paper yet,' it's important to organize what you know now and what you're thinking so far in the form of a dissertation. Second, find and choose a good research question. In fact, one of the most important parts of research and dissertation is research questions and subjects. The selection of research questions for research is very important. Choose important issues in each area, but look for new issues everywhere. In addition, it is necessary to continuously investigate and identify current problems and popular topics in each field so please pay attention to the review paper in the research field. The review paper is a dissertation that contains predictions and suggestions on which direction scholars in each field should conduct research in the future after comprehensively analyzing the latest trends or theories in the field. The review paper organizes various theories and existing research cases in each field by subject so it greatly helps to understand and view the field. Therefore, if you decide on a specific topic or research problem I recommend that you first find and read the review paper for the research topic especially the most recent review paper, if possible. In the review paper, you can view not only recent trends, but history of the past what kind of problems were found and solved in the past what aspects were studied by researchers what the limitations were, and how another researchers made effort to overcome this so how far did the results go In a word, the review paper allows us to look at the progress of research on the subject and research problem until now. At the end of the review paper, the researcher suggests like \\"This is the situation that has been progressed so far so which direction is promising and which direction of research is needed.\\" Those suggestions and arrangements can help you understand your research topic and help you to make decisions about where you'd like your ideas to go in the future. So, I recommend you to find and read the review paper for the relevant field first. The third is a guideline for efficient research. Usually, when we do research, we focus on what the answer is to this problem or to this topic. In fact, before we think about the solution we need to focus on what kind of problem this is what the nature of this problem is why it's difficult and what aspects to look at it. Start your research with \\"Issues, problems\\" instead of \\"Answer, solution.\\" So I encourage you to take enough time to investigate and think about the research topics or research issues that you're interested in first. Also, make sure you have plenty of free time regularly to focus and be creative. For example, go to the lab early in the morning and set a time to focus on your research without interruption from 8 to 10 and practice this. When you start graduate school life, it depends on the lab situation but in most cases, there's a lot going on in the lab. And because there's a lot of research and meetings in the lab with seniors, juniors, and professors you may not have as much time as you think to contemplate what this problem is or focus on what research at your desk. And there may not be as much time as you think to focus on research alone. So, when you go to the lab for the first time and then come out an hour earlier. If the lab usually has meetings or seminars starting at 9 or 10, it'll be 8 or 9 o'clock. You can come out about an hour ago and do your own homework or assignments about what you learn in class or you can use it as a time to reflect on and contemplate the research problem or progress that you're interested in. One more thing, especially in science and engineering For example, if you say,\\"I'm going to have an hour of my time at the lab at 8 o'clock,\\" you should talk to your colleagues or seniors in the lab and get their understanding in advance. Because you work with your colleagues together. For example, \\"I want to have time to concentrate on studying from 8 to 9 tomorrow so please don't interrupt me from 8 to 9.\\" In this way, it would be good to have time to focus on the area of interest by yourself. There's a reason why I keep saying, \\"From 8am or 9am.\\" Of course, you could schedule some time in the evening. For example, if your work ends at 5 or 6 pm, you could say, 'I'll have dinner after work and then I'll have my own time from 7 or 8 pm.' By the way, if you actually do graduate school, there are a lot of things like seminars and meetings at the lab after dinner. Because when you run out of time while working during the day, naturally say \\"Let's do the rest of the work after dinner. Let's do the rest of the work tonight.\\" So if possible, I think it would be good to have personal time in the morning. Of course, you can make a personal schedule late at night, but you need to rest at night. So I recommend that morning is better if possible. And when you do your research, consider when to explore deeper, where to expand wider and what to do separately. You have to focus by properly deciding on various perspectives, scope, and methods of looking at the problem, and in this process you can discuss it with your advisor, senior and research colleagues. Also, when you study a review paper or something about specific area, there is always a 'current state'. You can find a new solution, especially through some challenging questions about the assumptions they have today. For example, suppose an existing paper or solution solves a problem on the assumption that some input is the same. You can think 'Do the inputs have to be the same? What happens when the inputs are different?' Then, you can see why they had to solve the problem through that assumption and if they did without that assumption, what kind of things would happen and what issues would you be able to find and study more. Therefore, if possible, once you've mastered the previously established assumption like 'this problem is up to here from now on' you'll be able to come up with new research and solutions through the process of solving those assumptions and challenging them beyond the assumptions. In addition, some research problems may be simple but complex problems are common in most cases. So, to make it easier to deal with such problems, it would be better to divide the problems into several appropriate parts and solve them. Of course, when you divide one problem into several you can discuss and consult with your professor, colleagues, and seniors to properly share the problem and take charge of the assigned problem. It's also very important to demonstrate your ideas or solutions to other researchers. So it's important to think about how you're going to present your research process or results to others at the same time as you do your research. Also, set your own short-term and long-term research goals to conduct research and actively communicate with other researchers. There's a saying, \\"If you want to be an engineer, cooperate with others.\\" Communicate your research problems, approaches, difficult parts to solve, current results, and future plans with your assistant professor, your colleagues in the lab, and other researchers in the field and think of writing research papers as part of your communication. Don't forget that mutual cooperation among researchers is the basic principle that has been the driving force behind the development of sci-tech. If you think about your research paper as part of your communication it's also very important to be able to explain to others as easily as possible what approach you've applied and what you've achieved rather than explaining the problem with difficulty. In this respect, the fourth advice is to actively publish your research through papers. Always think about which research to publish to which journal. When publishing a paper, make sure that the co-author decides as broad and generous as possible if the person has any contribution, but instead carefully decides the order of the authors. I hope that as many people as possible can cooperate in writing your paper. When writing a paper, make it well organized and readable and interesting , be careful not to use your own terminology, or go against standard notation which is used only in your lab or organization. I also recommend you to include, organize and present enough existing research related to your research explain to your readers the importance of your research topic and the validity of your research methods and publish it in various ways. For example, in addition to publishing papers in academic journals, I hope you will actively publish your research in various forms, such as publishing papers at domestic and foreign academic conferences contributing articles, or writing patent documents. The fifth is about consistency in research. Your field of research has been decided to some extent when you enter graduate school and come to the lab and as you continue to study, you will gradually enter into specific details. Continue to explore, develop and expand your field of study and key research issues. Please study positively, especially in controversial areas. Because controversial areas and issues can be an opportunity for you to make a great achievement in other respects. The last sixth is to cooperate with others. Be good colleagues first and make good colleagues around you. Encourage your colleagues to publish research papers, and if possible, create and operate a cooperative system and a buddy system to efficiently write papers. In particular, a buddy system with lab colleagues who look at each other's papers in the calibration or review of written papers is very effective. In addition, if there is any achievement such as approval for publication of the paper or award celebrate with your colleagues and reward yourself generously. In addition, I hope you will continue to create and maintain an atmosphere and environment around you that supports and helps you with research and paper writing. To maintain this atmosphere and environment, we recommend that you discuss the issues with your colleagues and your advisor, and if necessary, make suggestions to create a comfortable lab environment where you can conduct your research well. Next, I would like to introduce the guidelines for writing academic papers effectively. When writing a paper, do not rush into writing immediately but first think and plan about the subject, scope, and structure of the article plan and organize based on it. Based on this, I hope that you will first create an 'outline' When writing, avoid boring structures, try to explain and express as concisely and clearly as possible and if the reader has been decided, write the paper in a style that the target readers are familiar with and like. You also need to try your best to avoid slang, buzzwords, repeated or euphemistic expressions, spelling and grammar errors. At the end of this lecture, I would like to introduce eight tips for writing and publishing a good paper. First, if you want to write a good paper, read a lot of papers, and if possible, a lot of good papers. In order to expand to a wider range, it is recommended to read papers widely not only in research fields but also in areas other than research fields. Also, be as objective as possible about your research or paper. It is necessary to objectively examine one's research problems, research methods, and results and to view and modify the written paper with the eyes of a third party. Next, you should use good English when writing an English paper and I recommend you to get professional English correction if possible. The fourth is a bit sad, but researchers need to learn to live with \\"rejection.\\" Entire career as a researcher is actually with rejection. However, instead of thinking that the paper is over due to refusal to publish think that you have received good advice from the judges and improve your research and paper. Then you can get good results. Therefore, rejection of sanctions is a painful experience but I hope you think and accept it as a routine process that goes through for good results. In addition, many people often \\"let's write a paper\\" after the study but you should keep in mind how to organize and write a paper not just before the study is over, but throughout the course of the study. In other words, don't forget that if necessary, the process or scope of the study should be determined by considering the writing of the paper. If you want to write a good paper, be a judge yourself. Getting used to how to critically evaluate a study or paper helps you evaluate your research or paper. Also, make sure you decide which journal to submit your paper to as early as possible. By default, look at the goals and scope on the home page of each journal. This allows you to determine what you need to publish your paper in the journal and to shape your research and determine what you need and what results you need. Lastly, if it is a good paper, the quality of the paper is the most important. Try to publish your paper in a good journal as much as possible and continue to challenge yourself to publish your paper in a better journal. This concludes the first lecture on \\"How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics.\\" In this lecture, I introduced the overall lecture and explained what research and paper writing means as a graduate student and what mindset and posture are needed. Thank you for your attention. Week 2 Title: Effective process for writing good academic papers Content: Today is the second lecture on \\"How to Write a Paper and Research Ethics\\" We will learn about effective procedures and processes for writing a good academic paper. I'm going to talk about some excerpts from Susan Stephenson and Steve Whitmore \\"Strategy for Engineering Communication\\", 2002 \\"Science and Technology Communication\\", 2009 which I published with my university professors. If you are more interested in today's lecture, please refer to the two books. So let's talk about effective methods and procedures for writing a good academic paper. In general, academic writing proceeds in stages of \\"planning\\" \\"implementation and preparation\\", \\"drafting\\", and \\"calibration and final editing\\". In the \\"Planning\\" stage, you schedule your thesis define and analyze readers, and set the purpose of your thesis. In fact, I can tell you that one of the most important parts in determining the purpose of the thesis is to define and analyze my purpose, that is, who the reader is to read the paper I write. The \\"Implementation and Preparation\\" step involves devising ideas and preparing for the writing of a paper. In the \\"first draft writing\\" stage, it is necessary to efficiently write the first draft and cope with the obstacles to writing. The \\"Calibration and Final Editing\\" step carefully corrects the draft and checks for grammatical errors and typos. At this stage, an effective response to \\"boring\\" and \\"perfectionism\\" is needed. I will explain in detail later how to deal with the obstacles in writing as well as the boredom and perfectionism that I just mentioned. Academic paper writing is an iterative and recursive process in which three steps continue to be performed interchangeably rather than \\"implementation and preparation\\", \\"drafting\\", and \\"calibration\\" all at once. The table below shows interesting findings. The unskilled author says he spends about 50% of his entire paper writing time \\"implementing and preparing\\" and 45% of the rest \\"drafting\\" and only about 5% of his time during the final \\"calibration\\" phase. There is a high risk that the overall completeness of the paper will not be high because only a small amount of time is devoted to the \\"calibration\\" stage of increasing the completeness of the paper through final finishing. If you look at this part, if you have 10 days to write a paper you think about how to write a paper for about 5 days and spend the remaining 4 and a half days writing and then you have only half a day. It means the first draft was made in the part where you just finished the paper for half a day and submitted. And there are many cases where it is submitted without sufficient review or revision. When you actually write it like this, it's just as time-consuming as you can imagine. 50% of the time without writing, but as the deadline is near, they write a draft and even write proofreading and submit it. As a result, not only is the overall writing process inefficient but the end result is not refined to such a high level. It's a general story. On the other hand, experienced authors spend about 25% of their total paper writing time on \\"implementation and preparation\\" 35% on \\"drafting\\" stage, and the remaining 40% on the final \\"calibration\\" stage. Because sufficient time is spent on calibration and finishing the final completion of the paper can be improved. Spending only 25% of the time on the \\"Imagine and Prepare\\" stage also means that you are constantly devising ideas for your thesis. So, in a way, researchers who are good at writing papers keep thinking 'what to do with the thesis' and 'how to write the thesis in which journal when the results come out' even in the process of continuing research in their heads. When he thinks 'Let's write a thesis', he can quickly complete a draft and then spend enough time to revise it meticulously, although he can do it alone but with his colleagues in multiple stages of revision. To exaggerate a little bit, students who write papers uncomfortable and inefficient usually don't think much about papers, but when they say, \\"Let's write a paper now,\\" but only then, they think \\"What paper should I write?\\" so It takes a lot of time to think and prepare and after they write a draft they don't have a few days to refine and revise it. This means that the quality of the thesis is not high. In other words, it is advisable to spend your time writing your paper as quickly as possible in the front and maximizing the completion of your paper in the back. Let's take a closer look at each paper writing step. First stage is \\"planning\\". A successful paper writer initiates a plan as quickly as possible starting as soon as he decides to write the paper dividing it into as many tasks as possible and starting the main tasks for writing the paper before completing the study. As I said, even in the course of his research, for example if he thinks \\"I have to put this graph in this form\\", it means that he'll keep that graph in advance. In addition, for good thesis writing, ask and identify who the \\"reader\\" of the paper and clarify the \\"purpose\\" of the paper to be written. When writing a paper, it is very important to set the \\"reader\\" and \\"purpose\\" of the article. You can more accurately determine the \\"purpose\\" of the paper by identifying who the \\"readers\\" of the paper are their expertise, their understanding of the subject, and their likes in advance. This page shows the questions used for \\"Reader\\" analysis. Who will read your writing? Are they a technical expert, manager, or businessman? And why do they read your papers? Why did they ask you to write a paper? If, when readers see the paper you have written, they will be interested in seeing the title or abstract of the paper, so what part will they be interested in? What actions do they take based on your paper? What information did they ask for? Are their instructions clear? Or do they need confirmation? How well do readers know about the topic? And how much background knowledge and information do they need? Are your readers familiar with the technical terms you use? What information do readers need? Do you have all the information they need to address their needs? If not I would like to emphasize thatwhat should you look for in what form and what contents should be organized and presented , what contents should be put in and what contents should be left out, etc. These things are determined according to what parts the readers will be curious about and need while reading the thesis you wrote. The following shows the questions used in the process of determining the \\"purpose\\" of the paper. What do you want to gain from this paper? Can you clearly and concisely describe the purpose of the paper? How does the goal of the paper relate to readers' expectations? Do readers share your goals? If not, what is the discrepancy? How can you meet both your goals and your readers' expectations? How do you know what your readers know and what they don't know? What attitudes or values should be considered in the paper? Rather than answering each question as a test I think it's good to use it as a guideline for analyzing readers and determining their goals by looking through these questions like a checklist. In addition, it is recommended to prepare and secure a good writing environment at the \\"planning\\" stage. Last lecture, I told you to create a quiet, focused time for yourself in the lab, and the same goes for writing. If you're writing and there's any other disturbance around you it's already difficult to write, so it won't be easy. Create your own writing environment where you can be quiet, uninterrupted, and non-disruptive. At this time, pay attention to the lighting and improve physical comfort. It's a general story, but when it's noisy around you when you're writing, it's hard to concentrate on writing. Because writing itself is not a very pleasant act. For most people, writing is painful, and they don't want to do it. So if you're already doing something that's not pleasant, but you're interrupted you can't see it well, nosiy around you, then it's very difficult to write. So when you write, you need an environment where you can write comfortably without being disturbed. Many researchers I know, including myself, have their own environment. Some people like to go to a coffee shop and sit quietly and write some people like to be quiet in the library's reading room and some people like to do it while listening to music at their desks. This means that you should try to find an environment where you can improve the efficiency of your own comfortable writing, and continue to maintain and organize that environment. It's not the same for everyone, but I want to tell you to find and create your own writing-friendly environment. It is also recommended to improve the usability of the computers and software used in writing the paper. Learn how to use word processors that are often used when writing papers and various software that is used to create pictures and tables. If you need to write a paper in a specific work environment quickly identify the devices or programs in that environment and familiarize yourself with how to use them. The second step in writing a paper for efficient academic writing is \\"implementation and preparation.\\" In the \\"Implementation and Preparation\\" stage, the topics and contents to be covered in the paper are organized and arranged. Outline, Outlining is one of the most common strategies used to organize content during academic writing to show the overall flow. You're looking at Microsoft MS Word's overview feature as an example. Graphics are sometimes used to organize various topics and contents and mind mapping shown on this page is one of the representative methods. Mind mapping is useful for organizing various topics and contents when devising a paper in a way that generates and visually organizes ideas by showing the relationship between ideas as you see. One of the ways to use graphics to organize different topics and content is the Taxonomizing classification method. This method is a strategy that visually organizes and groups various ideas based on common characteristics, as shown in the example. In thesis writing, logical order and pattern are used to organize ideas and content. Common patterns in academic papers include chronology of processes in chronological order of events spatial order of objects in physical relationships 'Comparison/Contrast' that similarities and differences between existing and new designs 'Order of importance' that from important to less important 'Problem solving' that explanation of problem, solutions and recommendations. 'General to specific' that explains the general point and then follows a more detailed explanation or special example. The use of these widely known patterns in organization not only helps readers follow the logical flow as a whole but also helps readers to understand and remember the content for a long time. I think you're most familiar with the order of time and space. In the case of chronology, for example, when explaining the history of usually related research there were studies like this in the 1960s, there were studies like this in the 70s there were studies like this in the 80s. It's very natural to describe it in chronological order like this. Physically, for example, if you often explain a schedule or journey it would be better to explain it from Seoul to Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan based on Korean standards. Rather than explaining Seoul, Busan, Daejeon, Daegu and back and forth, explaining in order that readers are familiar with and know the following in accordance with the logical order and pattern of science and technology. The third step in writing a paper for efficient academic writing is \\"Drafting.\\" In general, there are four ways to \\"Drafting.\\" That is, there is a way to combine planning and preparation drafting, and proofreading and proceeding at the same time. There is a way to separate the conception and preparation, draft preparation, and calibration. And there is a way to plan, prepare, draft together, and then calibrate afterwards. There is a way to plan and prepare first, and then draft and calibrate together. It is known that the shorter the volume of papers the more effective it is to combine conception, preparation, draft, and proofreading and the longer the volume, the more effective it is to separate conception, preparation, draft, and proofreading. In general, 5-15 page paper submitted to an academic conference or journal is most effective in developing, preparing and drafting together, and then calibrating. Now let's compare the pros and cons of each draft method. First, it is a combination of planning and preparation, drafting and proofreading. This method makes it easy to write down points and sentences even if you don’t have clear idea of how to write. Thus you can start writing right away, which is especially advantageous when there is no clear solution to a particular problem. If you typically have a hard time starting out it's a great way to start writing a dissertation because you show a high level of creativity and your writing is relatively free. The following is how to proceed separately by classifying conception and preparation, drafting, and proofreading. In this method, the content, format and organization of the paper are initially carefully planned and then each section is written as quickly as possible. Finally, multiple intensive complete corrections are performed. This method is typically applied to writing long documents such as user manuals or textbooks. The following is a method that is generally known to be most suitable for writing a thesis proceeds with conception and preparation and drafting, followed by proofreading. Remember to leave enough time for proofreading as this method combines conception and preparation with drafting first proceeding with proofreading. Especially with this method, maintaining writing momentum is paramount and once you start writing your first draft you shouldn't stop writing until you've finished your first draft. So, if you run into problems with conception and preparation or drafting don't waste time solving them, just mark them and move on. I can tell you that the important thing in drafting is to complete the draft from start to finish without losing your writing momentum. A draft is just a draft. This is possible because we leave plenty of proofreading time behind so we have plenty of time to take it and revise it to a high level once the draft is complete. This is an effective method for relatively short documents typically between 5 and 15 pages, or for single sections within longer documents. In this method, the act of writing a thesis itself is a clue to new ideas, new approaches to the problem at hand, and new solutions to the problem. In addition, even if the degree of completion is very low you can get some satisfaction because the first draft is completed and you can expand the thesis with more time because you spent less time and effort on writing the first draft. In this method, it is essential to have an undisturbed environment to maintain writing momentum and it is important to have ample creative breaks between conception and preparation and drafting and proofreading. Creative break refers to the time to take a break from the thesis writing work and give your mind and brain a rest. Through creative break, you can be more creative and motivated and also objectively and meticulously carry out proofreading work. After a creative break, even the papers you've been writing look different and come up with new ideas you hadn't thought of before. When you have 10 days, invest about 5 days at first or 5 days and half a day to come up with an idea collect various data, and then concentrate on writing a draft. In the process of writing a draft, if possible do not take a break, and make a finished copy. Once the draft is complete, you must be tired as writing drafts without a break. So you need taking a break for about half a day. When you take a break, you forget about writing drafts and listen to music, watch movies or simply take a break. When you take a break for half a day or a day through these breaks and then look at the draft you wrote next, you're like 'Huh? Why did I write this?' You can see a completely different side of what you do and you can fill in the wrong parts of the parts you wrote previously or the parts you left blank because you didn't come up with an idea when writing the original draft. That will be the positive effect of creative break. A word of caution, in my experience, creative breaks are all good but I don't think they're as effective if you're drinking or doing something that's completely disorienting. I recommend that you take a creative break with the finished draft in your hand or put it on a USB stick in your pocket and have a relaxing time watching a movie or going to a coffee house for a good coffee or food. The last method is to proceed with conception and preparation first and then proceed with drafting and proofreading in parallel. This method works well for longer documents, like 15 to 50 pages or when word choice needs to be very precise such as proposals, patents, or legal documents. Organization is very important in this method, otherwise when you pause in the proofreading process, it will be difficult to recall what needs to come next. Instead, reviewing the first few paragraphs will help you overcome your writing hurdles as the next idea will often come from what you've written up to that point. The key to drafting is to keep the momentum going and not stop writing. The writing barriers that are often encountered when writing a dissertation are related to planning caused by environmental factors, related to the subject, caused by words caused by form, related to readers, and caused by expectations and risks. Overcoming these obstacles through thorough preparation and strategic response is necessary for successful draft writing and efficient paper writing and competent authors are those who know how to deal with these obstacles. The fourth and final stage of the thesis writing for efficient academic thesis writing is “proofreading and final completion”. Proofreading is the most important process to remove errors in research papers increase reliability, and reconsider completeness. Since a meticulous and complete proofreading can take a significant amount of time it is important to allow sufficient time for proofreading during the initial planning phase. Also, it is not an easy task to review and revise your thesis several times from an objective point of view so it is recommended to take a creative break before proofreading. During proofreading, it is important to read the paper objectively and critically. Proofreading is carried out at several levels and aspects including content organization, persuasive emphasis format, rules, paragraph organization, sentence structure and word choice. When looking at a strategy to make calibration effective it is difficult to look at all aspects at once, so it is best to do it in multiple rounds. What I mean is, first of all, take a look at it to see if the flow of the article as a whole is okay. At that time, even if there are errors, they are ignored. The second one meticulously checks if the words are okay and the third one checks the misspellings. In this way, it can be said that the aspect of correcting several times while looking at one aspect as a whole is more effective. Rather than looking at a computer screen and proceeding, there are many cases that proceed with printing on paper. This will be a personal preference. It's fine if you say 'I prefer to do it on a computer screen' but in general if you print it out on paper, you can hold the paper and look at the front and back as well as freely take notes so printing out on paper and proceeding is still generally recommended. Since you are a generation that is especially more digitally familiar, it would be okay to just look at the computer screen and proceed as soon as you feel comfortable. I also sometimes find errors by reading them out loud. Strangely enough, things like typos and errors that were not found with the naked eye make sounds and this is called 'reading correction'. It stands out when read aloud. So you need to try something like this. To review the overall flow of the thesis, it is effective to check the outline of the document and make a list of recurring issues so that the review proceeds without omission. In general, it is recommended that you proofread an academic thesis 4 or 5 times by yourself and 2 or 3 times by a third party, a total of 7 or 8 times. In the case of proofreading by a third party, it is best to find and request a person who will later become a reader of the thesis and it is also recommended to organize and operate a buddy system with your graduate school colleagues to proofread each other's thesis. Graduate laboratory colleagues are not only colleagues in research but can also be helpful buddies in the process of writing a dissertation. In addition, it is a good way to rewrite the introductory part to check whether the thesis was written well as a whole. It can be said that perfectionism and boredom make proofreading for the completion of an academic thesis difficult. First of all, perfectionism helps to write a good thesis, but if it is excessive it makes the proofreading work infinitely longer and reduces the efficiency. To overcome perfectionism, it's a good idea to start by setting clear limits on the time and energy you can devote to proofreading and final editing. In addition, it is better to focus more on high-level proofreading such as the overall flow of the text and balance of chapters and verses, and the correction of missing or unnecessary content rather than low-level editing such as typos and spelling errors. This is because many of the low-level editing tasks are usually solved automatically by the word processor and can be processed mechanically by professional editors at the publishing house once the paper is confirmed for publication. Therefore, what you really need to focus on in proofreading is 'Was this thesis well written?', 'The flow of the composition, whether all the contents are included' 'Is the order okay', 'Is the balance right', etc. In addition, after publishing the paper, it is very helpful for future work to clearly understand the reader's reaction to the paper you wrote and to draw and analyze the difference between what you thought and expected when writing the paper and the actual reaction of the readers. To overcome the excruciating boredom of proofreading, it's a good idea to increase the difficulty of the task at hand by focusing on the more complex parts. In other words, it is not simple editing work to choose the right words but the high-level consideration and effort to think about which words can meet the expectations of the reader makes the proofreading work not boring. Also, list the interesting tasks first and do the more interesting ones later. In addition, it is recommended to clearly admit that proofreading itself is not interesting and to set up a system such as a checklist so that you can pay attention to the proofreading process again when you lose concentration due to boredom. As mentioned above, this time, we studied the effective procedural process for writing a good academic thesis. Thank you for your attention. Week 3 Title: Academic Papers in Science and Engineering, Selecting a Target Journal for Your Academic Manuscript Content: Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from Energy Science Department who is in charge of lecture three to six in Academic Writing and Research Ethics. From lecture three to six that I'm in charge of, I think I'll be talking a little bit more about the writing techniques of the paper. To start with lecture three, Academic Papers are completely different from the textbooks you've studied so far. So you have to think, describe, or write something completely different from the scientific facts and research methods that you usually see in your text books. I'm going to talk a lot about those things. In lecture three, let's have a time to think about which journals you're writing your papers in, and which journals you're researching will be published in, so many people will read them. First of all, let's get started and think about what papers are and what theses are. You usually consider them as academic papers. There are a lot of technical descriptions and reports, but the papers are different from those, and it's the papers that demands scientific technology and we see a lot of it in academia. Let me tell you how to write about such papers in science and engineering and what should we think about. Firstly, not all professors think the same because this course is delivered by many professors. Many professors write different papers, so all professors have different ideas. In other words, professors and students are individual people, so they all have different thoughts. There may be technical aspects in common, but the Academic Paper is a thing to write with many considerations?for example, which readers are going to read it or how readers will think about it?as paper itself is a series of conversations between individuals. Therefore, it has to be completely different from the books and textbooks that you've studied so far. Basically, writing a paper is very difficult. The reason is that you have to think about what kind of readers will read, and when they read it, you have to be able to let them understand exactly what you think based on scientific facts. If you've ever written a paper or have a chance to do so, I'm sure you'll have a very burdensome and painful time as you can see in the cartoon. I'll tell you why you felt like this and why this is more fun than pain. As you can see in the cartoon up there, a student is thinking that she wishes to show her thoughts on the screen right away. So do I. I also have a lot of time to think about how to describe what's important, and how to convey my thoughts when I talk to many readers. During those times, your hands don't go straight to the keyboard. I have to write it, but it's very hard. So I keep thinking - let's write it, how should we write it, write it, I spend a lot of time like this. And then it's painful, usually. Because it's difficult, you can think of it as a natural process, which may not be such a big challenge in reality. Starting today, from lecture three to six, I'm going to tell you why. Another case is the cartoon that you see below, where a professor corrected the paper written by a student. The student saw it and said, \\"You fixed all of this.\\" The professor didn’t fix just a word or a grammar, but he fixed everything instead. He fixed the whole paper. And the professor says that it is easier to write a whole paper than fix or comment just a part. There are very important points in here. In fact, the papers that you write about the research from the beginning?let me rephrase that you read. The research papers that you read are written in one story from beginning to end. But the written story is an individual's idea. In other words, it contains the thoughts you are writing and the thoughts of the co-researchers who worked with you on the paper. As each person’s different ideas becomes one paper, when one person starts writing, the person's thoughts are contained from beginning to end. So there could be some errors that you thought of. If you correct one error, it's much easier to correct the whole paper because it's not just one error, but because you have to express the person's thoughts from beginning to end. In fact, even if I fix 10 to 20 pages of paper that my students bring, when I go through each word and sentence several time, and I think, \\"Why did I fix this?\\" or \\"Why did I say this?\\" So I have another period to fix the whole thing. Then, as shown in the cartoon, a student got the fixed part and wrote it again, and if the student show it to the professor again, he will fix it all over again. And he’ll give it back again. So this cycle lasts forever, to be honest. And before you say okay, even if you say okay, it's hard to submit until the professor or co-researchers says okay. But one of the most important things about the process is how well your thoughts are reflected, and how consistent they are from beginning to end. Through this process of writing dozens or hundreds of papers, you will be improved. That might happen, but at first, writing a paper after just reading it will be quite difficult. So I'd like to talk about those things together and tell you that it's not just that difficult. As I said in the introduction at the beginning, writing a paper is communication with many people; for example, how readers will read this, or even before them, we communicate with many researchers and editors of the paper. In the way of communication, as there are many ways of communicating between people, even if you are alone, other people have their own thoughts, so there are always different reactions. I'll tell you a few of the reactions, and let you know that you don't have to struggle with them. For this example, I wrote a paper and submitted. Fortunately, I passed the editor?I'll tell you later about the process of submitting the paper and how the paper is made?and went into the review process. This is the content of referee in review process. This paper reports this, this, and this on a subject. And there’s interesting results. Those results are first, second; the editor summarized like this. Making summary like this perhaps this referee read the paper really hard. Or the referee might just read the abstract that you wrote and organize it like that. I mean, you don't have to believe everything that referee has written down. Because from the perspective of those who have been researching or writing for a long time, those two, three or four points that you think are important can be picked up very easily just by reading the abstract. So the referee said that those results were very interesting. These results, however, are not significant at all and do not have enough novelty to be published in Nature or Nature journals. Then what are those wordings? It is fun, but cannot be published. This might let you down. Why they say no, even though it is fun? So what I’m going to say from now is that we need to read the thoughts of the people who are expressing like this. The expression says: the results of your research are interesting, but there's not enough significance for your papers to be published in Nature or Nature Research journal. That's never a very negative view of your abilities or your research results. So you never have to take that person's idea as it is in the review points. The referee says that it is fun but not enough, that is, however, an individual’s idea. Saying not enough doesn't determine the value of your research results. That's why I can agree or disagree with this individual's referee. Most of times people don’t agree. Because it's normal not to agree if someone else sees your research and thinks it's bad. If you agree there, you may have been wrong when you wrote your research paper. So we talk again without agreeing. We communicate. In this paper, we actually did somethings, but we might have given some misunderstanding. Then we might say we'll write it again to make the point, and then we’ll go to the revision process again. Let me see another example. Similar content is described here. If you look at the first line, very detailed experimental data are provided and presented, and made something about it. This work is very interesting to talk about. It is interesting and well organized. Well organized is not easy to hear, but it feels great to hear it. Because there's a time when you have to write the paper well from beginning to end, and it means you did a good job. But it states that despite doing well, the of the work is not sufficient to warrant its publication in high quality journal like Nature. Publication in high impact journals like Nature Science may be difficult, but I’m telling you again that it doesn't mean that your findings are very bad, as I said earlier. The expression, “not sufficient to warrant its publication” is just an idea of that referee. If this referee thought like that, he would make suggestion to contribute a lower-level paper. That's how we normally suggest. You get suggestion, then you read the paper again, but you might admit the idea; so basically, other people get to see your paper again. Then, before we go through it, we can identify that there may be some misunderstandings, so the referee may not have been able to pinpoint our research. This is because that the referee says that “the work is interesting and the paper is well organized. There is no reason describes why it is not worth publishing. Then the referee who reviewed this paper may not read your research paper thoroughly. You might notice in the first sentence that the referee didn't read it thoroughly without talking. There are two ways that you can do after you knew it. “Yeah, I'll give up.” or “Since you didn't read it hard, I want to talk again and change your mind.” In my case, I always choose the second option. I always talk them again. After discussing about it again, I give up when I really can't, and I publish it in another journal. It takes a very long time for people to communicate with others with different thoughts before rejected and accepted by other journals. So, it is very important to you know how to organize your thoughts with professors and co-researchers and accurately convey them to others and tell them exactly why this research is better research and scientifically valuable. That's why you need to know that this is what a paper is about when it comes to communicating with so many people. As you can see while searching on the internet, there are so many journals and papers that are always published. So let me tell you about the process of choosing papers and journals, and why and which you should choose. Those papers are classified in Creative Analytics of Web of Science by their fields and levels, and you can easily organize your findings and why this paper should fit in certain fields. You've probably heard of SCI a lot. Scientific papers, including engineering and basic science, usually fall into SCI or SCIE; social science into SSCI; and art or humanity into AHCI. There is a process in which you look around what papers belong to each classification and contribute to them. In the process of making the publication, the first way you can categorize is by a parameter called impact factor. This impact factor can be a very important tool for you to decide which paper to publish to. If you think the research paper is really great, you'll choose a journal with a very high impact factor, but if you think this is important in this field, but it's not urgent, and everyone else is showing this much, you'll choose a journal with less impact factor. You can choose it by yourself or with your co-researchers; for example, if you think carefully about what impact factor tells you, you'll know why. The number of impact factors determines the level of the paper. The way to determine the level of the paper can be easily seen here by how to calculate the impact factor. It can be determined by the proportion of the number of papers that have become public in journal for two years and how many are quoted in two years. The impact factor is high if the number of papers is small and the citation number is large; in other words, other researchers cited a lot of papers in this journal whether the result is good or bad. Because one may not quote, a lot of quotes mean that so many researchers have read them, including those who did not quote and those who did. Saying many people can read it is that many people might think that the research results are important. So you might be studying with those high impact journals. That's why many people publish papers while enduring the painful times hoping they can be read my many people, not by few people. Usually, based on the impact factor, one hopes that the paper that he or she is writing now will be read by a certain number of people, but the scope is broad in each field, so it really depends. So in choosing a journal, first you choose whether it will be read by a lot of people and consider the importance of the research results of your own paper. In fact, if you search for certain papers, you're using Google Scholar a lot these days. If you use Google Scholar, the first parameter to be seen with the paper is how much the paper was quoted. In some papers, the values are always presented as you can see here. Contents of the paper is hard to find. However, along with the paper’s title, it shows how many times it has been quoted. It may be a paper from one person, but it always says the number of quotes under the title in Google Scholar. It's important how many quotes have been made. Because the number of people read it determines importance of the research results. So usually there's always a lot of quotes from Science and Nature Physics, very high-level journals that you know. That's why we want to publish a lot to journals with high impact factors. Rather than wanting to have a high impact factor journal, because of the process that research results are acknowledged by many people through communication and use them again, we want to publish them in this high impact journal with high citation. Then you'll always have a question like, \\"Are we going to post only high-level journals?\\" In fact, it's a very difficult task, so you need to make good decisions on the papers you write. So I'll tell you briefly about the ways to decide. Each person has a different personality, so if you ask me, I always pursue a high impact factor. I always pursue a high impact factor, some of my papers go through many failures, and they even publish in low impact factor journals. If you ask me about why you're trying so hard to publish such a high impact factor while taking so much time, you have to think which journal to publish. Because we have a purpose to publish a paper. And the purpose is because we want it to be read a lot. We want it to be read a lot, so we’ll want a high factor, too. The high impact factor is actually publishing in a short time. There are many cases where the high impact factor becomes public in a short time rather than the low impact factor because of the desire to show the results of my research to the world in a short time. Because it's always competitive with many other researchers. This competition is also difficult, but it is very important that I win this competition and contribute my good research results to a good research journal, and publish it. Then there are some points that you need to think about when you decide on a paper. You must first increase visibility. Because you're researchers, you are shown by people when showing your good research results to many people. In order to improve this, we also decide on a paper. And we want to save time and effort like here. If you start to publish with high impact factor, it's highly likely that many of their papers will be rejected. Then the time will be re-involved, and since the paper will not be submitted in the same format, additional efforts will be made to revise it again. So if you consider these times to communicate with people until publishing, you might want to save those time. And the other is that you may experience a lot of situations that the research papers that you submitted are not publishing, but rejected. You choose the most appropriate papers to reduce these things. So usually, I think about a few things. The first thing you should think about when choosing your paper is what research you are doing and what journals you are reading. The journals you're reading are similar to your researches, and you're probably reading a lot of papers to study them. So it's usually normal to publish to the papers you're reading. Then it's very likely to be high-level journals because you're learning and studying. So there's always a question of whether you're going to start with a high level, but you can decide some candidates for several journals. About the studies that you're studying in personally. Then there's a reason why you have to choose one. For example, Nature, Science, and others have different fields, such as Nature Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials. If you think of four magazines like this, Nature and Science, which have high impact, are interdisciplinary, so there are a lot of broad scopes in the papers. There's bio, materials, and chemistry. Physics and geology, too. It shows all the papers in a very wide field. So you can choose Nature Science first. But you might think that scope is a little specific and a little narrow. If you studied nano, you choose Nanotechnolgy, rather than Nature. Or you can choose Advanced Materials if you write about materials, but the first thing you need to do when choosing the candidates is to read the scopes of the paper. Because some papers have scopes that they want in their journals. But the paper that doesn't fit with the scope, for example, you studied nanomaterials, and you studied photonics with that nanomaterials. Because it's a nanomaterial, you can either go to Nature Nanotechnology or Nature Photonics. But if you think about what significance is most important to your research, the journal that fits the scope can be Nanotechnology or Photonics. Just like that, it's very important that you always think about the scope of the journal and make a decision. Then we send it. Then the response of the journal comes, and when it is published, you can see whether you have chosen the right journal or not. There are a few things that you need to worry about during this long time, but these things are very technical, so I'll keep telling you later. So I also try my best to write a good paper like you, but I'll tell you the first the way to save time. To save the time, the usual methods may not be to write out quickly and post quickly. The reason each journal has an editor is because he or she is thinking about whether to send a review or not. From my experience, it usually takes about a day, 24 hours, or a month at the most. So there's one way to reduce this period very much and move on quickly. I don't think a lot of people did, but I would like to recommend you to do it since you were a student, and the thing is to send a paper to this journal first before I submit it. Only to editor. Send it to the editor and tell him or her that my paper has this amount of significance and there’s a reason to be publicize in this magazine. It doesn't matter because it's my idea. 그 사람들은, 에디터들은 받아들일 수도 있고요 무시할 수도 있고요. move on to the next step. If you communicate with editors first to shorten the process and get good results and go over the review process, for my personal experience, it is more likely that your research would be a paper. So it's not a bad idea to always do pre submission's inquiry and it's the best way to save time. So I'll talk about the technical parts, such as the process of choosing a paper in more detail in the next chapter. Week 4 Title: Structure of an academic paper Storytelling method for academic papers Preparing for writing academic papers Content: This is the fourth lecture on ‘Academic Writing and Research Ethics 1’ In this class, I will tell you how the structure of the academic paper is organized, how to communicate with many people as I said in the round of three, and how to prepare for good writing. First, the structure of the paper. If you look at the papers that you are studying a lot, the composition of each paper is slightly different. However, the basic composition is set, so you can think of it as a slightly modified form of each thesis in that set rule. From the high-impact journals to the low-impact journals which you choose, the scopes of all the papers may be different and composition may be different. The other is that the composition is different depending on what paper it is, so I'll look at this composition and talk about the important things in each composition. I'm going to quickly turn over the slides. First, it's the title. After the title, as you always know, they are the authors. There are authors, and the first sentence that comes out is Abstract, there are sentences of abstract. When the abstract is finished, the introduction usually begins. Materials and methods usually go in or out after introduction. Because each journal might have these materials and methods at the end. And it's also published in other files like other surfman process. In addition, after the introduction and the conversation about methods and materials, the most important results and discussions are always coming out. These results and discuses come in one section in a barrel, and they come out separated. You can decide how to write, but you can also write according to the way you are targeting journals. And when it comes out like that, composition isn't just consist of only writing, but as you all know, writing is shown in figures, and you're talking about the results of your research showing table that is organized. The other is that when this is done, there are usually acknowledgements that say, \\"How this paper was executed with some help,\\" and references that say, \\"This paper cited other papers and what papers are quoted and where they are described. That's how the papers are divided into sections of about 10 and as little as six. Each of these parts has many points that you need to think about. I'm going to try to talk to you based on your experiences. If you think about what to read first when you read the paper, the degree of significance will be determined. As always, most read the title first. Most read the title first. The author won't read first to read. Perhaps there is an effort to find the professor's thesis only to read the research papers of the very good professors. Then you can look for authors first. But we usually start with the title. If you look at the title, it can be very simple and difficult to say. The title should contain ‘what thoughts you have and what research results you have written’ and ‘what is the most important thing’. It's hard, right? Yes, the title is very difficult. I think writing a title is the most difficult part than writing a certain part. Me, too. That's why I'm always thinking about the title until the moment I submit my thesis. Because this can determine everything, we always consider the title as our top priority, even during the ex-premature that we're always writing papers, in the middle of the section, and in finishing step that we're writing the conclusion, always I'm thinking about the title. Most people think a lot about whether this title is appropriate or not, and whether this title attract a lot of people's attention. And through this thinking, most people write title. Then, we write authors, which is basically very technical, so if you write your own papers, it will be natural for you to become host authors, and your supervisors or co-research professors will be registered as corresponding authors. Everyone knows these parts, so let's skip them. The next important thing is that when the title is decided, which covers all with some limited wording, and the reader who read the title usually only reads abstract. They read abstract first. When they read abstract first, as I said in the third class, this abstract is very important so that you can understand that the reviewers only read abstract or read the whole thing well during communicating with reviewers. Because with about 10 words or 15 words that I said in the title, you're going to spread them out into 100 or 250 words. The abstract, which contains why it's important, what you've studied, what the results are so important to this society that what these results mean, is the most important part of your entire paper that follows the title. And you would write whole thing which the abstract contains with being limited, and elaborate on these things, that is the question of why the introduction did this research, why the introduction had to do it with the references, background and literacy, and why they had to do it, and what is promo definition and raising questions you would present, what is problems, or what new ideas I was trying to use. So introduction is also important. Then, the introduction is then written about three to five times as long as the usual abstract. And there are materials methods section. So there are parts that is how you go about doing some research, for example, how you analysis with some material and ingredients and how you interpret some results in some way. Maybe it's important right now. I'd yet rather awkward because title is also important and I said, abstract is also important and all important. The reasons why they are contained and contents of each part are all different, so everything has to be important. You'll spend a lot of time on the result part. For example, the part of the result, when you show the result, the first way you can show the result well is to show pictures, graphs, and tables. Yes, that's right. In my experience, the reason I'm telling you about my experience is because each person has different ways of looking at each paper, choosing a paper, and studying, so when I read paper, I read first the title and abstract, and basically understand what research this paper did and what results it has. If I decide whether there is paper's worth, that I take the time to read this research pape, or not, I go to the result section first and I look at the picture first. And I look at the table first. I will first look at how the results of the study were measured and what data are there. And the data that I saw, when the detailed data came out, when it caught my attention, I read the sentences that were described in the result section. So in this result, to make you read to a lot of readers, you'll have to make sure that you can clearly see the good pictures and detailed data. In addition to writing a paper in English, efforts are also made to show the data well, so the period of writing this result part is very long and requires a lot of hard work. Then, you have to think about how to show the results and how to develop them. Here are some rules that show, and the most important of them is number one. You can think that number 1 is deciding everything. As you can see in this number one, how clearly you are using tables, pictures and graphs to illustrate your results, and figure is not usually just one in the paper, but at least three, as many as you can decide, but there can be a lot of pictures. Whether you show first most important data and what basic data you're going to show, or how to start with the most important part and show the data you support later. And about this logic, how to unfold the logic in your paper which you think and imagine. And when you're explaining that logic, it is important to show it very clearly. If your logic is a little tangled during the screening and while communicating with others, people think, \\"Oh, I don't want to communicate anymore.\\" The, there's a possibility that reviewers and referees will give you reject. Or because the paper is well organized and not well written, they are 'Write the paper again and send another reject or order to revise again. Therefore, it is very important to make it easy for others to understand what content is said and how it is said. And, for example, like writing in the fourth part, a unnecessary data are not needed. Because it's really unnecessary to paint unnecessary data and brag, \\"Oh, I've worked hard on research and there's a lot of data.\\" If you put that unnecessary thing in, this logic will be broken and maybe the clearance will fall. Then, people, who read and wirte paper and read written paper, feel very difficult to read that paper, and if they think 'it's difficult', there is a process that many people don't read again and don't quote. Then, the quality of the paper can be reduced. Therefore, it is important to avoid presenting unnecessary data that does not fit logic and is not clear. It's the discus part, and the way I usually write a paper is to talk about results and discusions together. I shows the data and discuses why the meaning of the data is important. The word \\"discussion\\" means, I write, but other people will read, judge and think about the importance. Then they'll think about whether it's right or wrong. Readers. That's why we call it a discussion. It's important to tell them why it's important. Then, because you have a lot of data, you will always try to talk what parts are important. But people who read the papaer, like the readers, reviewers and referees, want to know first what is most importan. Because they should figure out what most important is, you have the duty to highlight the most important part for them. And you would talk why you do many these studies, why you give a lot data and then you would say logically what word is the most important by using them. What you think. So, while communicating with others, if you think about putting importance on top and bottom, as I said in the previous chapter, how to decorate the result will be decided. Logically. Based on that logic, your wordings will be decided. It's decided which points you're going to clear up the most, and the title will contain the main concept, which you're going to call main claim. About how appropriate it is to be in the title,your ideas will get into discussion and into the process, that is your ideas will convince others. In this persuasive part of discussion, if logic is twisted and the result is a little bit out of order, it's hard to convey these parts correctly. That's why it's very important to write it logically and clearly, and to show only the data that you really need, not unnecessarily. And tables and graphs. I know that it takes a lot of effort. It's hard. But most of all, there are processes where you have to look at it several times and fix it many times, technically and without mistakes. Because the tables, graphs, or figures contained in this are the determination of your real effort to simplify the data and content you've gained during the time you've spent writing the paper, and perhaps, this graph is more important than the English sentence you've described. Let's think this once. There is a textbook that you see and study. In the textbook, there are many paintings. Where did those emerge? Yes, those came out of papers. Then, the error in paper is that, will they be on the textbook? No. When great determination of your hard effort is really important and clear enough to be in the textbook, the pictures itself are in the book. And then your fame and name is forever left by husedae, even if you die. Therefore, I think it is very important to draw a picture. I hope that you will get good enough research results to appear in the textbook and get pictures which could be inserted in the paper. And finally, acknowledgements. Acknowledgements describes what support you received. For example, how you got help by doing discussion with other peple, and you need to spend money on research. You just would describe that 'what kind of source was this research fund, and there was some other help.' These technologies may be extremely ethically important. This is one of the most important things you should think about when you write your paper because it is technically and ethically important. Finally, references. These references, in a way, are very easy to dismiss and dismiss as nothing. But in a way, it's a part that you have to write very well and make very well. Because, the reason why you're usually putting a reference is that you had quoting other people's findings first. Other people's study is nothing to do with your findings. Even though it's irrelevant, if you think it's okay because you did it with similar materials or research in similar fields, you write the reference somewhere. You may have thought that part of introduction or result is related to the result, but if you put this reference on the introduction, it could be a big problem if you put it up if it's irrelevant. The problem is that the delicate reviewers and those reviewers even read the introduction because they decided that the research results of this paper were okay. If they had read and judged the results of this study, they would have wanted to see why you did this research in introduction, or how you solve rob·lems. They are going to read your thoughts. But in the process of reading your thoughts, because they are reviewers and referees who are see references and well know them, they would think 'why did this research paper choose a reference that had nothing to do with it?‘ In that case, from the perspective of reading and communicating, I mentioned it once in part of discussion and part of result , but unnecessary content is included. If this unnecessary content is included, the reader will think, \\"Oh, this is weird.\\" It's weird or they will think, \\"Oh, I can't read this well.\\" If that happens, when your efforts are judged in this research paper, you will be slightly less likely to be evaluated. So, the way to write references is different for each research journal, but what's common is why you have to write references, why you have to quote them, and why your research results are newer than previous research results, so you have to choose the right one and try to do a good job of writing them. You will write a paper with so many contents and each part is written based on its importance. As I said, the most important part is how to explain it logically. How you explain with logic is determined by the way you tell your story. Most importantly, storytelling is the first thing you should think about when you write a paper. For example, if you have a time to discuss or introduce your research with your friends, maybe you spent a very long time writing your research paper. When you introduce it, you can't introduce it at the same time. Then, you'll usually think, \\"I have these studie because there are these researches, and because these researches has problems, I will try to follow them or overcome them. You are going to talk these things logically. The way you talk logically is storytelling. This storytelling isn't done after you write it. Yes, you have to think about it before you write it. Since you wrote it with much thought, it becomes possible when you introduce the storytelling. Then, let's take a look at how to do this storytelling in Academic Paper. There are many types. The way of storytelling is quite varied, and there are not any fixed rules. However, the reason why there is no any fixed rules, I'm telling you over and over again, is that to communicate and talk person to person is the paper. And there are several types. If you look separately, there is a typical way, too, or how to write very dramatically. Also, a series of drama is storytelling. There is a drama that is dull but continues to have a story. And there's also a drama that's very dramatic. The same way, you can also choose them. Because you are the author who write your paper. And the magazine style. Ah, usually there's a bit of confusion in this magazine, paper, and scientific journal paper, but the magazine tells everyone to read it. Nature or Science Journal is a magazine. So the magazine style is a bit of a high impact journal, and the magazine may have a unique way of doing it. But if you look at how you create storytelling in most dramatic or general ways, you can create your own storytelling very easily. I told you that it's important to speak logically in the part of result and discussion, as I told you the most important parts from the title to the 10 sections. The logic is briefly contained in this title. As an example of this title, there is that ‘I wrote all-graphene, hoping that graphene would be a transparent and flexible field emission device.’ If you look at the topic and title of this research paper, they implies everything. You might think, \\"Ah, this research paper has all-graphene as much as possible, although there are different configurations of different devices to make flexible and transparent devices.\\" Then, if you read it, the general concept doesn't come out first. It comes out from the background. Why explain the background of this study first? The background of the study is that it determines what field of study this field is in and what part it belongs to. So, we start writing the background that everyone can know easily. I'm sure you've heard of this background in magazine articles and online. It explains what graphene is like. It's well known, but they'll mention it once. When they mention it, there are points that say 'what's important'. It describes what was important, why this field is important. If they do so, it becomes a little more specific and the field is limited. The background will come out. We talk about big things, and among the important things, the background that others know well, and it's a little related to the background. You going to talk about this part. As it happens, you're going to re-explain what you've done and why you've done what you've done. So there's a way to use the flow from this typical background to the end that shows the overall look of the finishing line. How to organize dramatically is my preferred method, but it might require a lot of practice, but I think this practice is very important, so I recommend you to practice it. It's a paper that anyone researched with a similar topic. It's a published paper that was contributed to Nature, and if you look at it, it's very well written. The reason why he wrote it very well is that I can read it easily from the word 'graphene' to the end that means figure. Because when you think while reading it, you all know what kind of background it has. These can be taken care of, but, as highlighted here, the use of these words and each of these parts can be a substitute for this well-known background that we talked about in previous chapter. So when we describe these parts, we usually briefly introduce the key parts of the previous researchs in writing this dramatic way. The reason we are introducing the key parts is that the High Impact Journal introduces the best of the previous studies. It would have been best because it was key, and when we explained the results of the research, we said, \\"Why should my paper and my research result be such a good paper?“ In this way, how to talk description dramatically, if you describe ‘my paper is good’ or ‘my study is great’, reviewers usuallyl think only ‘Yes, you are great, right out here.’ But generally, in this way, you could criticize the limitation or problems in best one of previous research results, and point out the problem to the technical and scientific facts. Why are you done? You had solved. You had settled, and You hadovercomed. And if you say, with general fact, the best study and point out the problem, even if you only write short ‘I got some results though some research’, reviewers think 'wowo, there are mportant research results in this important field of the research but because they have problems, the author had get over all, this? Then, you might contains their own ideas. This yellow highlight part may contain most important research result. This makes it easier and more dramatic for all readers to access. Because of this part. It's really great if you know what the problem is in previous researchs through your ability of grasp. It's really, really great that you're saying there's a problem with very important research, or there's something you have to overcome. You deserve a compliment. But if you've solved that, it's amazing. Since you're expressing your greatness, it might be more effective to write easily doing this from the beginning, from the field and point out the problematic part and describe it briefly as \\"I did something.“ Next is a different storytelling format in a similar field of research. There's a way to write like a paper that usually points out that there's a problem. There are other research papers that describe motivation well. Rather than describing motivation as \\"problematic\\" about other studies andprevious findings, it is very important to talk about motivation calmly about why this research will be more important in the future. Then, you would talk that 'whether it is scientific or engineering' or 'there are needs' or 'because of what needs'. As you describe these words, you talk about why there's an advantage and why this paper becomes the right topic. So there are usually many trendy research papers in magazines. 'Trendy' means because there is a demand for the best results for fashionable research papers. So, because there are many ways to tell stories like this, the results of their research have some significance and you decide how to talk about the significance. So when it comes to making decisions, it's up to you to make decisions, you have to remember that to decide, talk and show writing is to communicate, and about communication , you're going to soften that communication by saying something logically and you are having to choice ways to convey well your research result. Another storytelling method is Thesis style that you write during term. Then, again motivation is written similarly. And there are processes of being written that contain advantage and why the research paper was appropriate. So, as I told you, storytelling methods are decided naturally, after you choose how to show your research result depending on the importance of the results. I hope you choice well and have a well written to the ends from the overall title. Then let me tell you a little bit about the technical content of how much data we have. As I will say in the next course, the research paper has many different titles. There's a 'Letter', a 'Full paper', an 'Article'. There are scopes and criteria required for each of these papers and the length of the contents. If you go into each magazine, when you think about how to say your research results, take a look at each of the research papers because they are well explained along with the scope. If I tell you why it has changed so much these days, you'll have to think about how you're going to write your thesis again. It's changed from a long time ago to now. If you look at the simple trend, the main figures are small and very small these days. The number of main figures is small, and the number of supporting figures is very large. Today's papers are roughly. Because so many papers are published, so many researchers write so many papers that they can't run and read all of them, so the main figures, only the really important figures, are contained in magazine, on the other hand so many data, a little less important data, are needed because so these are important for describing these main figures, that the magazine need so many back data. So a lot of back data can usually be downloaded from the Internet with other documents, and not in the main figures or main papers. However, from the perspective of reviewers and communicators, they always need supporting about results that they could not understand easily by using only main figures, and they also judge whether this is an innovative and new result from figures of supporting. You put a lot of effort into supporting figures, like main figures, so that many researchers, reviewers, and refereees can make good decisions. As such, these days, the trend is changing so that one can do one's research results. So choosing some of the main figures, as I said, will determine the number and order of the logic and how much clarity you can use to explain your research results. The order, number, and decision will determine the number of supporting and the order of supporting. So when you prepare a lot of data, you have to think about how to show clarity with logic. So I'll tell you again in the round of 5 about how to publish these papers, but I'll basically tell you a simple process. Please get ready. If you get ready, you'll make a contribution. This research paper, called \\"Cover letter,\\" when submitted, can be 10 or 20 chapters, or more. The editors of each magazine don't read all of these things. It's hard to read. So they want to quickly understand what importance that have. You have to help them figure it out so quickly. To help them, you will write a over letter. So many magazines are asking for Cover letter. So, as I said, the title is important in writing the entire paper, the abstract is important, everything is important, but one of the things I personally force is this cover letter, which can be more important than anything else. You've worked so hard to write a really good paper, contribute, and write a cover letter that the editor asked for, but if it's so hard to write this paper that you had filled out just a few and submitted them roughly, may the editors reject such a good paper in an instant, within 24 hours? Then it'll be really, really depressed. Then, if this cover letter decides it, you need to think about how much more effort you have to put into it. So for writing this cover letter, along with writing the entire paper, I spend a lot of time writing a page or two that really implies thousands of thousands of words. I hope you write well because the importance of this cover letter, which says why it's important, as I said before, background, results, and talks about them in one or two sentences without paragraphs, is really important. So the editor looks at the cover letter and checks the contents. If they think it's good, they'll go through the review process. A comment comes from the review process, and the editor sees the comment and gives you a response. When they give you the response, it can be reject or they order revise, or it can be accept. But usually the case is having undergone a revise. Suffering through the process of revise and revision, editor would be the last to your paper called ‘accept or not.’ In the process, a lot of time has been detained. This process. In the process, if you take not revision but reject, you would decide that you accepted that or you will fight or persuader, through communication with the edior. Because this process is very, very long and difficult, you have to write easily and clearly for reduce the process in the step of writing cover letter, doing submission and writing the paper for submission. So, usually many people write cover letter so short when publishing. Usually it's written a very brief. This well aware that it is very difficult to write briefly. Very difficult, but I'll recommend that if you write a lot of research papers in the future, you have to write it concisely, logicaly or clearly. And so if you are reading a lot of research papers these things, you have a need to think that ‘How did they give me clearance, how they did give me logic’. So if cover letter written like this, you would do submission through these systems. The submission the results tell that what reviewer said, like commnets, what reviewer2 told, so ‘What about this all of our response.’ In this response, the contents of the reviewer1 are ‘What is it about right and one by one, what is wrong and ask, what is exactly what an experiment where we once again shown or thought.’ Usually, when we communicate and face to face, we just talk and persuade each other. We have to communicate. It'd be nice if we could just talk about it face to face, but you don't usually know who the reviewer is. Of course you don't have to know. There are journals that let us know these days, but we don't know, so we understand exactly what that person thinks and we write response letters. After writing like this, it barely is published and that's a year or it can take a year, two years, or three to four years. In order to shorten this period of authority, I think you need to think about how to do storytelling and which paper to write your research results in, and write a good paper. This is the end of the fourth lecture, and from the next lecture 5 and 6, I will tell you again about the very technical content. Thank you. Week 5 Title: Types of publication and structure summary Title, Abstract Content: Okay. This is the fifth lecture on Academic Writing and Research Ethics. The course discussed how to write a research paper and why what and how we have to consider in the last third and fourth lectures. So many types of the way how to write a research paper and thus each importance is different than lots of considerations are needed. And today we will go through which contents should be considered. First you can see the type of publication in journals. I am sure you already know this. But for students starting for the first time, it is important to know what kind of studies they have to write, so I tell you briefly. First, articles. Full paper contains what and how you’ve done with the results, what the results are, and why they are new and important. This full paper could be more difficult for you since it contains a lot of technology contents. This can lead to an endless cycle, as shown in third lecture. It could be more difficult because there is a process of writing, and fixing a lot of parts, and making the whole context consistent. Although full paper is important, recently many journals include letters which are short and concise. So, letters are used for results containing significance and urgency. There are difficulties in writing letters with clear logic, but it could be tried first. Students are studying review paper rather writing. Not all of the professors write review papers though there are many professors. This review paper focuses on addressing the overall performance of a field. So why the field is important is shown in the review paper by the process quoting the comprehensive results on research papers. These cases are very helpful for you to write papers. So, you can read a lot and see what kinds of content are included, and how it is organized rather than writing. What is important in this review paper is that some results are graphically shown. It could be the result of the author writing the review paper, but it is usually the result of other’s one because of its importance. If your research results are good, clear, and excellent, other people will quote you on their review paper again. This is why you have to think hard about how to show the figures, data, and graphs. Because a lot of people read the review paper, if your results are quoted in the review paper and other researchers find it, they will read your paper. Thus, it’s very congratulatory that your results are on the review paper. To do so, you need to try to show graphs and data exactly on your paper. And lastly, notes. Notes are short articles that are one page or less. When you read some papers, such as the high-impact journals, or articles that introduce them, you can find out notes or news. Actually, I don’t think there are many cases for students to use notes and news. However, the notes deal with the importance of the paper, so they are written about selected papers. If there are papers and notes about results similar to what you’re doing, be sure to read them. You can see the easier and more important results in different directions on the notes. I recommend you to read notes carefully since they are articles where you can broaden your perspective on papers. To sum up, papers are written in the full paper, letter, news, or review or something like that. The review paper is also expressed in a different way for each journal, such as a progress article or review. So well, good writing skill is important whatever type of papers. In addition, the structure is important, so let’s take a look at how to write the importance of each part. There’s only one reason why it is important to write a good paper. It’s to make the paper publish. It means to reduce the chances of rejection. Wrong papers would be rejected 100% on my experience. Because readers can’t understand. This is not good. Then, most of the papers that came out are well written. So, the reason why you have to practice to write well is to save time and reduce being rejected. And no matter how good the results are, there are many cases where you don’t get recognized for the quality of your results and ideas. To avoid this situation, you need to practice to deliver them properly. This is another reason you should write with good skills and structures. So how to write well? Each composition has its own important parts. Let me just point our a few things. First, title. In the title, the most important thing in the entire research paper need to be concisely described and it should contain why you researched, why it is important, and so on. Make a title that leads others to read your paper. This is a way to increase your citation and make your findings widespread in the world. You can decide how much too concise a title is if you decide how to tell the entire paper. And the next important thing is abstract. An abstract is a short paragraph that summarizes everything in the introduction, results, summary, and conclusion. Practice explaining the words in the title by extending them instead of using them the same way. How you do this summary determines whether it is good abstract and good writing. It is important that you practice this title and abstract always no matter what you write. Again, the title, abstract, and plus, introduction is important. People see the title first as I always say in lectures. If they think the title is good or related, then they read abstract. There’s a reason why you have to write the two parts very well because people make a judgment based on the title, abstract, or cover letter. If they think both of title and abstract are great, then they read the introduction to know how the writer got the idea and what the writer thought. I often go to detail or data right after seeing the abstract, but I usually just go through the introduction. Since these three parts, title, abstract, and introduction is important, efforts to make them at similar levels with professional papers could be made. As for how to write a paper technically, each part from the abstract to the discussion has a different tense. In the case of abstract, past tense is commonly used. The background could be explained in the past tense while what I’ve done now could be written in the present tense. In the case of introduction, both of past and present tense is used. Because you need present tense when you say ideas, structures, and thinking. You write with the past tense of the previous results in introduction. Methods and results are almost past tense because they write what and how they did, and what they knew before writing this paper. But discussion includes different things from methods and results. You write a lot of things such as ‘it has a meaning’, and ‘it is important in the present tense. In the discussion part, you write in the present tense like ‘it is important rather than ‘it was important. Then, let me point out what is important about each part. First, the title is simple phrases that are not even sentences as you know. Furthermore, it is composed of the most important keywords because it needs to be concise. So, to write the title well, pick keywords from your papers such as ideas, or methods, and list them all. Pick up about three keywords. Only a few may be important or all may be important in these keywords. Give priority to each of these keywords based on its importance. If you think that other people must know about a particular keyword, prioritize it first. It is a common way to list up keywords and think titles from them. So experienced professors and researchers are always organizing keywords in their heads and thinking about how to develop them. But no-experienced students should practice organizing what they think is important and write it logically in short titles, longer results, and discussions. And the important thing is not just to say ‘I did something', but the whole result of this study should be included concisely. Words that have not been written in the paper may be used since one or two words have to show the result. You need to think about important parts of the paper and write them with keywords. I don’t write the title at first and always think it about until submission. The reason for that is simple. It’s to deliver with this importance. To do so, it should not be too short or too long. If it’s too long, the meaning can be distributed. Too short tile is not easy to convey the meaning you want. There’s a case that people, including me, use a lot. In some fields, if I need long content, I can also write it with a subtitle. It is easy to know what I did with subtitle. There are a variety of cases, such as concise titles and titles with subtitles, so it is important to write them according to your paper and logic. In title, these words are used commonly. However, many journals avoid these titles which include redundancy, formula, or symbols. Thus, it is needed to make effort to express what’s important, what’s new, and what’s essential. The other one is that you have to choose the words specific rather than wide. For example, ‘Magnetic alloy’ is too vague and is a very large area, so it is better to mention specific terms like this. It is important to create an attractive title because many people could think it is worth reading this paper after seeing the title. So sometimes, there’s a title starting like oops or oh. Actually, it’s really hard to see. You can choose words that lead attraction as much as you think. Usually, journals have titles from four to more than ten words. But as you know high-impact journals have a short title. And when you see it, you can direct know whether it contains importance. In most cases, titles are written concisely, so you need to explain your paper with fewer words. Furthermore, it could be end with question mark like this. As you see now, for example, this title “What is a gene?” makes you curious, leading you to read more. In another case, when you read “Can Water Store Charge”, you think “why?” or “How?” and are able to approach easily. That is, it is very attractive so you need to think about this format too. Or you can utilize long descriptive titles. But as I show you, long titles have less impact factor than short ones. This is because these researches are too specific and less broad. Thus, the paper could be in specialized journals. In reality, there are some titles with deep and long descriptions about some particular materials like this. When so many words are included, it is easy to understand, but it could be considered as just a simple one of the methodological studies and thus, less important. Even if it’s important in certain methodologies, it’s less important on the whole. Thus, the higher the impact factor, the shorter and more concise the title is. I’ve shown you examples so far, and I would tell you about the abstract from now on. As I’ve said over and over again, the abstract is an extreme summary. So, it should be easy for the reader to know what kind of scope there is and decide whether to read more. So, it must be clear and simple. This objective is simple. You have to include all introduction, methods, results, and discussions implicitly, and it should be very objective and accurate. While doing so, summary should be precise. You have to summarize the things written in a thousand words with pas and present tense. There are journals that can be written in 100 to 300 words, but usually, are composed of 150 to 200 words. It is short but understandable. So, when I write an abstract like this, I don’t refer to other research papers. Some cases like magazines could contain references, however, basically, you write what your research is about and what it means to you instead of reference. For example, I wrote one or two short sentences about what happened in this abstract. In detail, “There was a problem” or “There was a research”. Discuss the background in the first sentence and raise a question in the second sentence. And from the third sentence, I wrote down what research was done, what results were most important, and what it means. This is up to three sentences depending on the content. In this case, one material could be two phases. In this paper, it was important to engineer the phase transition between semiconductors and metals. Then you can put keywords in the middle in this way. The author could summarize the most important and key contents in one or two words while reporting these methodical contents. Then, readers can easily see that ‘it is related to a field called polymorph engineering’, ‘the object is this material’, and so on. If you express the strengths in a few sentences like this, the object which leads readers to understand easily could be written. It ends by saying what the specific result is and how it was obtained, and it includes a sentence that can convey such a key meaning. Then, this is a structure that conveys ‘something is a problem in some background’, ‘because something was difficult, I solved it in some way’, ‘the results of doing so can lead further future studies in this field’, and ‘so this research is important’. So, how much of the potential audience would be interested in your research results depends on choosing these methods. I emphasized titles and abstracts since they have to be concise, clear, simple, and logical. Abstract, as well as title, is written later. This is because you should write an abstract with logic that summarizes the reason, process, and result of research after writing long sentences as a whole. Like this abstract, you can write a very short paragraph last. And you should consider if the title is concise, clear, or important again. So, the course discussed the title and abstract in the fifth lecture, and the rest will be continued in the next sixth lecture again. Thank you for your listening. Week 6 Title: Introduction Materials and Methods Theoretical Basis Content: Okay, Let’s begin the sixth lecture of Academic Writing and Research Ethics 1. We talked about the way to write title and abstract and importance of them in fifth lecture. This time, I will briefly talk about how to write the introduction section and the rest of it, except for results and discuses, including materials, methods and theoretical things. The part that I’m going to talk about more intensively and more importantly than anything else is introduction section. So is the title and summary, but the introduction section is important because it lists the reason of importance, ideas and philosophies that you have, results you have achieved and the way for all of them. Usually, there is no meaningless study, but in order for the study to have a lot of meaning, you need to make others to think that this research has high importance when they hear or read it. For this reason, the introduction section is very important after title and abstract because we have to describe in detail. So, making a good introduction section needs a lot of time. Let me tell you why. Introduction section is the part that you study the most when you read a paper. I mean, do we need to read all the book with over a hundred pages to understand it? The research you’re doing right now is a very specific part of basic science field, so the research is a little smaller than the whole field. So, to understand the importance and the reason why these researches had been proceeding, there are many cases reading first or second paragraph of introduction section in detail with a lot of time. For studying. There are references in paper, so you will look for them again. Those references were written in the past, so you can understand the backgrounds of this research historically. Then you have to organize important references well and state specifically because other readers will catch why these researches have history, how you think and mention the important things in history and how you state about the importance of your research. There are several ways for writing in introduction section, but first sentence is very important. The first sentence should be written very importantly and informatively. If someone reads first sentence and think ‘this is not important at all’, they will not read it. This is why writing first sentence of introduction section importantly and informatively decides the quality of whole introduction section. So, I’m talking about why and how we write introduction sentence. Most important thing is why you started this research. After that, you write about the problem, the importance of problem and why it was important. Then what will be next? Your research should be something different with others, right? It’s new research. So, you have to write what’s different and something new. Then you have to write how you did. When you write about these two things, you always talk about what your ideas were and what you conceived. So, if there are new methods of new ideas, they will have a huge worth. Describing exactly how you obtained them and how you will talk about them will be needed in introduction section before anything else. After that, you will write 1 or 2 sentence describing which result is the most important one in last part of introduction section. By just reading title, abstract and introduction section, readers can easily read a paper; ‘Oh, this paper is written in these ways, with these ideas and results. That will be read easily, right? There will be good paper or so-so paper depending on its importance and signification, but these things are essential in introduction section to be a paper. So, describing problems and stating which contribution research made for society is very important. The thing that I always emphasize in my paper and for my students is what is my idea. I think this part, I mean why and how I did it should be philosophical basically. There will be something technical, but my research can be different with other people. Writing how you started the research and what’s different with others is very important because delivering them and your ideas well can decide the value of your paper. So usually we write introduction section with importance. Choosing appropriate tense is important and that’s why I told you before. But there are some cases when we read papers. There are too many redundancies in the beginning of introduction section. There is little redundancy in abstract section. Papers you read will have a little redundancy in abstract section, too. But the redundancy comes from these cases. If we suppose that we choose a field and there are several words in that field, it feels like there are only those words in every sentence if we use them repeatedly. Then, if you use very specialized term or define them as abbreviation and mark the importance of them frequently, it is easy to understand and feel importance of them as there are attached explanation. As using same words again and again makes readers feel redundancy and gives image of bad introduction section, I surely think that you will fixing these parts a lot with your professors in endless cycle, but you should be concerned about it in advance to write good introduction section. And here is next thing to avoid. It’s too self-evident. To write title, abstract, introduction section concisely and logically, as I emphasize, you have to avoid meaningless things and repetitive things. Choosing a language needs a lot of practice and time but though you are beginner, you can easily understand that escaping from repetitive things, redundancy and meaningless sentences or phrases are important because they can ruin the whole logic. There is another thing. I make same mistakes, too. My paper published in 2021 will be very old one when 2030 comes. But we handle the events that breaks out at the point we write, we use the word ‘recently’ a lot in introduction section. But you’d rather avoid that word if possible because the word ‘recently’ will sound weird to the people who cites and reads your paper or research results in future. So, if your paper has long span and importance, the word ‘recently’ should be avoided except the moment when you point out the problem of that specific point. There is one more mistake that people make a lot although they need to write concisely and logically. I remember that I mentioned it once in fourth lecture. The way of referencing is important, too. There was my student whose references of paper were so messed up. It was like, there were references without any importance and, or references without any relationships between research results except in the field. With these problems, readers don’t read the paper right after reading introduction section. ‘It’s totally irrelevant. Why would do that?’ So, you should cite the core papers with high importance. Citing recent review papers that people read a lot and papers containing various results is normal and usual way. Do not cite paper blindly with one sentence talking about the research. It is very important to examine carefully and choose appropriate reference. There is one tip. If you don’t even want to do that, just write a lot of things and cite one review paper because review paper contains all of them. It’s possible when that review paper has all of the things you wanted to say. There are many cases that use one review paper, not numerous references. But there are many cases that doesn’t work with just one review paper because it is important to point out the key point that was important in other people’s paper, and show the reason why you wrote this paper and did this research. If the result was recent one or so important that it can be even in the textbook, you have to mention papers including that result and reference them in introduction section. I’ll show you an example. This paper is the introduction section of ??? that I showed you in the fifth lecture. I divided it in 2 pages, and there are 4 paragraphs. As you see, fourth paragraph’s head sentence starts with ‘We report...’. Before writing ‘we report...’, there should be this in third paragraph; ‘As blah blah was the most important thing, we tried blah blah’. Yes. And when you read the last sentence of previous paragraph, you can understand the way paper says. This will include texts like this; ‘In this perspective, these substances can bring new possibilities and opportunities and that’s why it is so important’. Then the target that you research or context that target can overcome will be in the paper. And then, this will be your own idea and would not be the fact that everybody already knows. Making references to include things that everybody knows and putting something different in the main content is the way to draw people’s attention and write it logically. After that, you will highlight the importance in the last sentence right before finishing the last paragraph. It will help readers to understand what you write before. It will be basic background and more detailed background. Then if you think about the way to write introduction, you make a lot of effort to write the first word. Surely the first word is important, but in the perspective of configuration you think, just wrap up the background in first paragraph and write what was core content or write the problem like this paper in second paragraph. Things you did, the result you achieved and the way you wrote the paper will be next content and if you try to understand this flow of paragraphs of introduction section, I think it will help a lot your paper writing. After introduction section, there are ways to write material section and method section. Let’s get to that point. Why do we write material and method? It lets readers know the target of your research. Then why do we talk about methods? You did that research and other people will read that paper. The reason why you appeal your research’s worth is to help your friends who are in same competition or following you and future juniors to repeat your research. For that, writing scientific paper will be very accurate and you ought to tell them in great detail. To tell them in great detail, you need to very good at describing methodological things when you say how you did the research. In that case, just mentioning that practice can be worth enough. So, there are many cases that write method and material section mechanically but describing the merits and validity about them for future researches can be a point for a good evaluation. As material and method section has that purpose, you have to write content into the point that other people can repeat the research result. And as the result and conclusion should be useful, if you don’t say the way you researched and how you achieved the results clearly, it would be hard to believe all of them, right? It’s hard to believe. So, writing very clearly and in detail is the important point. There are several elements. Describing the materials that you used, preparation steps, protocols for practice and how you measured the measurements and calculations in detail is usual, and you have to state how you analyzed the calculation and theories. Just writing ‘we measured these, we calculated these’ will make very short sentences, paragraphs or content and make people think your paper too poor-contented, so writing in detail and let other people try and apply your valuable research result is important and that is duty of writing the scientific paper. So, the materials are not just ‘materials’, and they can be various, as I told you. Treatments can be various, too. It is easy to decide with things to write when you think what to say and how to say about the materials. There are things to avoid and ways to write. As it is about the materials, it can be just same with the previous sequences if you easily write ‘I did like this’. In that case, put references and let them make readers aware of that method. The first method. You have to explain how CTAQ was synthesized very long, but if that explanation has redundancy with other papers and is mechanical repetition, you can just put reference on them. The Second method. You can just put references for each step that you need references. So, write it with accuracy, and to get rid of big redundancies, good referencing for this material section and delivering it clearly is important. There are several things to avoid when you write these materials. There are some noobs who mention the name of company of equipment or substances to write clearly. But avoid that. Usually, making clear means writing technical specifications like exact naming of substances you used, exact amount of them and the condition you used them. In methodological perspective, writing the source or way clearly is important. If you think ‘I used these, and everybody will know about it’ and write paper, nobody reads that. So, writing material section in detail with deep concern would be great, and hope you refer these important things to mention about chemicals or materials that I posted on screen. Method section is same, too. You have to decide passive or active just like material section. We choose passive style in usual. In introduction section, we choose style like ‘my idea is this, I did this research’. We use words or sentences like this style; ‘This was measured, these substances were made.’ And please avoid maker, trade, branch or brand names just like material section. And huge amount of background contents will not be in material or method sections. But cases like magazines or high impact journals want very detailed explanation about how you achieved that result and informative because those results are so important. As there are some cases that won recognition by this, I want to tell you that you need to have a deep concern about your paper’s form to write method or material sections. Lastly, I will briefly talk about theory papers and research papers. Theory papers basically need theoretic basic thesis and method for calculation in detail. But it is really hard to read and understand the content if you try to show these detailed requirements in equations. Although usual theoretic papers use a lot of equations, theoretic paper writers try to use equations as minimum as possible and change them into languages. In theoretic papers, if there were 10 equations, writers don’t write all of them. They write first equation and some important equations. Reducing number of equations and explaining why the last one is important in finish is normal content that are described in theoretic papers. Here’s example, method section of paper that I used when I explain abstract and introductions section. Method section of this paper shows synthesis part, instrument setups part and instruments of many cases that should be measured clearly. And it describes calculation and what the researcher did theoretically. When we take a close look into the description, temperature or conditions, for example, are clearly described, and synthesis part is written in detail because other people like seniors and juniors in same lab can follow this synthesis to try this research in the same way. Plus, instrument setup part describes briefly about equipment and results achieved. Although it is brief description, it’s very important to write about the condition clearly. As without these conditions in your paper, people work in same field cannot understand which XRD brings the result, it is important to describe conditions clearly to make people understand the result and think ‘Ah, in this condition, this result is inevitable’. Also, as you see here, you have to write why you did the measurement for what you want to know briefly. Writing concisely like this is very important. It’s different with just writing ‘I did this measurement for this research, I did this for this result’. To secure justification of your research method or tools you used for research, you have to describe concisely what you tried to investigate or whether you measured just the result or measured to say something. And there are many cases that explain the methods you used for calculation part with references. Don’t make it too long. It is important to tell things that everybody knows, make it more specific for the things you researched or calculation and let other people follow your method section just like you did. As I emphasized, when you write introduction section and experimental method and material sections, introduction section needs deep concern about how to draw attention of audience and delivering your idea and that’s the main point of introduction section. It is surely important to make citations and methods of experiment clear and logical, and make your sentences and logic show that your research has depth enough. I told you about the whole configuration of paper and how to write title, abstract, introduction and experiment section, and I will end my lecture part. Thank you for listening. Week 7 Title: Results, Discussion, and Conclusion Content: Hello, I’m Kim Ki Hyun who is in charge of Academic Writing and Research Ethics in this week. In this week, you will learn about Results, Discussion and Conclusion. Last week, probably you would learn how to write Introduction, Methods and Experimental Explanation. This week, you will learn how to write Result and Discussion. Result and Discussion are the most important parts of Academic Writing. When you write and compose them in a good way, you can say that you write your writing flawlessly and your academic writing can be published. The first step to write Result and Discussion is to select appropriate data before you write those sections. So after arranging data from a lot of experiments you had, you have to choose the most meaningful data and organize them most briefly, clearly and logically. Almost every student would write research notes using any tools such as notebooks or document files to arrange raw data from experiments. As you know, you won’t use all of raw data in your writing. So the first important step is to extract meaningful data before you write Result and Discussion. Recording the memories or feelings when you got meaningful data or made mistakes during experiments and putting those things in your writing are also important for your writing. For example, we can’t remember contents, mistakes, or specially-observed data after a month. So it’s important to record your thoughts and memories when you found meaningful data on your research notes. After extracting meaningful data from research notes, you have to decide which can show your writing most efficiently, such as table or graph before you write results. After you make tables/figures efficiently, arrange in a proper order to make a logical story. This process can be the most important and difficult part when you write Result and Discussion. In addition, in Result section, it’s important to put distinctive data or problems that you found in the process of experiments in the logical story if you think it’s meaningful. And you have to separate Result section and Discussion section and write only results in Result section. In Discussion section, you should write how you interpret the results. Now on, let’s see how we should write Result and Discussion properly. As you know, because purpose of writing Result is to express effectively what we discovered or observed, it’s important to rearrange results and express briefly for public and readers who read your writing. Showing results as figures or tables is well known as the most effective and definite method. So after deciding if you convert the data into tables or figures, you should also decide what kind of figures can express data most effectively and conveniently because there are various ways to express data. Most of all, it’s so important that you write results objectively. For example, when you explain “The car is fast,” you need detailed numbers such as “The car is 150km/h fast.” You should not express subjectively like “very effectively,” “good” but explain results showing specific numeric values, and those values should have comparison target. For example, you need to write “The medicine is ~ times as effective as existing medicine” when you explain “The medicine is effective.” You need to write “ This device has better control than the existing device,” when you want to explain the device you made. In Discussion section, you should explain how to interpret the results, as I said before, you’d rather separate Result and Discussion section. Result section includes what you observed or measured. Discussion section includes interpretation of the results and impactful explanation about meaningful data. But nowadays, Discussion and Result section are often hybridized together. Once I wrote my thesis, I put some discussion in Result section. Some reviewers commented “Why did you write discussion in Result section? You should move this part to Discussion section.” In these days, there is a growing trend that Result and Discussion are hybridized like Result-Discussion-Result-Discussion. For example, in this writing, there is a subtitle here in Result section. A keyword is here on the top of the paragraph explaining this result, and this figure is composed well of the result. The result of this thesis is written like this. You can see how the author of this thesis explained the results very clearly and objectively using specific numeric values. And this thesis has hybrid section of Result and Discussion as you can see. In this writing, this graph shows result well, like in figure1, ~~ explains ~~ result. And figure1-b is an good example of objective explanation. In most of recent writings Result section is written with fancy graphic design, and also neat graphs with a sense of unity. One of the important thing when you write Result section is selecting important and proper results among all results you have observed. You would have a lot of data in these days, but the better the writing is, the less figure it has, like 4~5 figures, or 6. Less important data-however, you have to include it in your writing- is put into supporting information or appendix material file. Some writings have 60, or even more than 100 figures and data in supporting information because they have a lot of high level data. Look at this sample. Here is a method in the front of results. This writing has separated Result section. The author wrote subtitle on Result 3-1 and here are the contents of subtitle. The figure consists of A~F with splendid composition. And figure 1A shows ~ result, figure 1B shows ... result with objective numeric values. Here is supporting information – figure S1A. Important data are in figure 1A~F, and less important data are in supporting information file. They are written in the middle of Result section. So figure S1, S2 mean the numbers of supporting information. At the end of the writing, here is appendix and it shows that there are data in supporting information file. You can check numerous high-leveled data in supporting information file if you open the data. So it takes several years to be included in good papers in these days. It’s important to write research notes and arrange data because you can use not only data included in the body of your writing, but also remaining data which should be put in your writing. To write Result section, first of all, extract meaningful data from raw data, which is massive and unorganized. Then decide tools to express the meaningful data such as table, or figure. After making tables/figures, decide the order of tables and figures. There are cases where we should compensate preceding data to support quality data. So we sometimes do experiments for preceding data later to make data prettier and more logical. But the preceding data should be put in the sooner order than the quality data. Therefore, it’s important to rearrange order tables and figures to make your papers logical. After deciding the order, create a storytelling to explain results according to tables and figures. All figures and tables should be explained in text as if talking. Even in case of thesis, it’s better to explain results simply, distinctively, logically, and with fun like a story or a fairy tale, so that ordinary people can understand it than to give a hard explanation. So in Result section, you need to make a storytelling text after making these figures. You have to make a really good table and figure. I’ll teach you how to make a table and figure next time. At this time, I’ll explain how to write Result and Discussion section intensively. In Result section, you need to summarize good result data you found. After analyzing data, convert analyzed data into proper format, and point out what was observed most importantly. For example, here is a table about data 1 to 10. You don’t need to explain every single data because we can’t recognize what’s impactful and it’s boring. So you should emphasize data 4 -for instance- if it’s most impactful and highlighting. Another good way to explain specific observation is questioning and answering. And you must explain about result of control experiment. Because a result of control experiment becomes the standard of effectiveness. In addition, nowadays AI is really developed and numeric values in thesis are converted into data, so it’s also important to show negative results. Express results didn’t appear about negative results. Above all, don’t forget to explain if the result is statistically meaningful and write important negative results. Meanwhile, you shouldn’t write discussion interpreting results in Result section. Because it should be in Discussion section. And it’s meaningless to explain background again because you would already explain background in Introduction. In Result section, just results. You don’t need to repeat what you wrote in Method. You also don’t need to explain raw data in the middle, and specific calculation. Let’s wrap up Result section. I’m telling just general cases, it depends on theses. Generally these are much-criticized part so remember it. You should write Result section in the past tense. Because you write the results that you already did experiments. And put numbers in order on figure or table. Sometimes, Figure 1 comes out first and Figure 3 and then Figure 2, but it shouldn’t be like this. Figure 2 can come out again after Figure 3 if it came out sooner than Figure 3. So you should put numbers in order on Figure or Table, and you should mention Figure 1 in text if Figure 1 exists. So remember you should quote table/figure number in text if you have it. Let’s look at this sample. Here is Result, and subtitle. Probably the contents of this subtitle is being described here in text. This is supplements data, same as supporting information. It’s less important than the main figure, but still important so it’s in supplements data. Here are much supporting data. ‘Figure 2A is from this data’ is written here. Figure is consisting of A~D. As you see, Figure 1 comes out first. Figure 1 first, especially 1A, 1B first then 1C. Figure 1, 2, 3, they are in the right order. And then Figure 4 here, right? It’s important that figures should come out according to their numbers so remember it. Although we can’t look all of these contents, you need to remember that data should be written objectively in Result section. And now, I’ll explain about Discussion section. A purpose of Discussion section is to provide interpretation of results you found. This section is a part that supports the reason why you came to this conclusion. Although this is interpretation of the results, you have to write really objectively. Don’t write subjectively. You can explain distinctive points or particularly negative points, and why it was negative or positive in this section. The easiest way to explain is comparison with existing data, such as how different your research results are from already-known knowledge. If results were different from general facts, what’s different? If results were better, what’s better? If results were worse, what’s worse? Or results fits well with original purpose. In Discussion section, explain why they didn’t if results didn’t fit. It’s easy to write Discussion when you write if our first hypothesis worked out, how those results can influence, how logical your results are, or how they can be applied later. Of course it depends on the field of study, you can write within these 4 categories. As I said, Discussion is like this when you write Result and Discussion separately. But nowadays many academic writings are mixing Result and Discussion section together, and that might be more logical. In my field of study, we prefer writing Result and Discussion together to writing them separately. For instance, result A is ~~ because it’s ~~ and it’s expected to ~~ and result B is like ~~ and …, because it’s better to explain logically. Let’s look at this thesis. This also has a form that write Result and Discussion section together. Here is a subtitle, and first figure with figure number 1, It’s S1, it means this data is in supporting information. So Figure 1 comes out first. And looking at the interpretation of the results, here is Figure 1. It looks neat and clear, unifed with A, B, C, D, E, F. It’s a good sample of integrated Result and Discussion, writing results, inserting discussions in the middle and putting reference together to explain why author interpreted results in this way. So sometimes it’s more convenient to write thesis and looks more logical. You can write according to your field. We tend to write Result and Discussion together also in my field. To give a tip for writing Discussion, it’s good to write this section like you give a presentation in a seminar. It’s more comfortable to explain using Q&A method. There is a case that you explain important mechanism to draw results, and you can also write research results as many as possible in Discussion section. I think it’s good to explain if your hypothesis is right or wrong and why, and if the design you experimented supported hypothesis properly and why, or not, what you can suggest as an alternative. Let's look at it in table. When the research results are consistent with the hypothesis, explain this theory is correct and why. On the other side, when results are different from hypothesis, explain why they are, then it’s Discussion. Don’t write this in Result. There would be strange writing Discussion later than Result in some fields of study. Then, it’s a good way of combining Result and Discussion to put explanation that results came out different from we expected, comparing with some existing literatures or data. You should write Discussion in a simple way, not too difficult. It’s important that you interpret your research data in proper depth, I know it’s hard to define how deep is “proper,” because it’s difficult for readers to understand your writing if you use too difficult theory and methods. In Discussion section, you can explain theoretical implication or ways to apply practically, express theories, specific relevance, or generalization when you made certain equation or pattern. Also you can explain more in detail about exceptions, or summarize various results you got from experiments. Continuously, it’s about how to write good Discussion. You won’t be able to answer all of questions by one experiment. So you had better draw a big picture during Discussion section. In the back of Discussion part, you write the meanings from your research results, how your research and research results can go far in your field, and what you recommend as a follow-up research. These are some good ways to wrap up Discussion section. When you mention researches that have already been conducted, use past tense. Use present tense when you mention general principles or facts. You may judge this. Next, what do you have to avoid? Don’t write things too inconclusive, abstract, imprecise expression in an unobjectified state. Don’t repeat results already in Result section, and already used expression in manuscript. Be cautious not to write contents you wrote in Result repeatedly. This is my thesis. It’s about making a platform that finds antiviral active substances concerned with covid-19 virus we have suffered for a long time. You can notice that by the title. I’ll tell you the start of Discussion section. You can start with explaining general concept. Because we made a platform that finds antiviral active substance from natural product, I explained what natural product is. Then I explain why we found the substance from natural product, results are like these and ~~ meaning. So first, explain the biggest key and concept of your thesis in Discussion section. The point is that you should write content that wasn’t included in introduction although it could be. Start with general stuff and get more detail and detail, to the part that interpret results, summarize results, and mention what the next research should be in the future. Now it’s Summary. Actually most of theses do not need Summary so some of them have it or not. But in case of very long full-papers, it’s helpful for readers to understand when you put summary in each main point. Because it’s too long and contents are extensive, organizing contents for each section is effective. So Summary shouldn’t be too long because it’s confusing what the purpose is. And in Communication Form, it has Summary sometimes because it doesn’t have Conclusion section. In case of short papers, such as note form or communication form, Summary section makes an end of the papers instead of Conclusion section. So check format of each thesis, journal. This is a thesis in communication form, and it doesn’t even have Introduction. It directly starts from the main part of thesis, and doesn’t have Result and Conclusion. Here is “In Summary” to summarize the preceding contents briefly. This communication form contains a summary, which is more like a conclusion than anything else, and that’s the concept. Lastly, there’s a Conclusion. As you all know, in order to clearly and briefly interpret a whole papers including Result and Discussion, we write “Conclusion.” Of course, you’re not going to use all the findings and results. You just have to write down the major results, and you can write down the parts you want to point out. You can’t rewrite what’s in the Discussion, and suddenly write down something irrelevant. You can organize what you’ve organized since it came out well. And of course, you have to write based on the results you used in your thesis, You can't just bring the Abstract. This is very important. The good content in Abstract should actually be included in the Conclusion. When people first look at the Abstract, they can predict that this paper would have produced this result. That pretty and predictable Abstract should go into Conclusion as it is, but you can’t write it exactly the same. So be careful. However, the easiest way to write Conclusion, in my case, is to bring the Abstract to Conclusion and erased Background, and organize conclusion in a slightly different way of tone and order. As you see, Conclusion is not another Abstract but the content is same. So the key point is that you only have to write down important results and findings. For example, there is a research paper with the hypothesis, “Is there a man on the moon? What do people on the moon eat for breakfast?” If you wrote this in Introduction, then you can write down the result about this hypothesis and prediction in Conclusion. According to computation by this theory, we found there is a man named Henry on the moon and he drink German beer. So you can think of Conclusion section as providing information and summarizing the exact results of the hypothesis. Let’s take a look at the content of Conclusion lastly. Conclusion is probably the mandatory section for most papers. So this paper also has Conclusion section in No. 3. You can do the summary as it is. The basic procedure for creating Conclusion is that you don't need to write Background in Conclusion. Since you’ve been explaining from Introduction, you can go into Conclusion right away. Author wrote “We developed ~~” in this thesis. So in Conclusion, about questions like “what did you study?”, you can answer “we developed ~~”, “we investigated ~~”, “we found these medicines.” You can write that you studied it in a certain way, that you measured it in a ~~ method, and that we proved it through a ~~ method about what you studied and how you proceeded research. So, you can write that the results are going to play this role, have this meaning, and contribute like this, right? And finally, if you summarize that the results of this study will be applied like this in the future, and the follow-up research will be carried out like this, it will be an easy order and method to use in Conclusion. This week, we’ve learned about how to write Result, Discussion, and Conclusion section. Thank you for listening. Week 8 Title: Tables/Figures Content: Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> who will teach you about ways to make Tables/Figures in academic writing this week. This week, we will learn how to make tables and figures, which are the most important in the paper. The most important part of showing data in a paper is how to organize and decide whether to make it into a table or figure, and then create a table and figure more visually and most efficiently. So what we're going to learn this week is very important. For the first time, I think I told you last time how to make tables and figures from the results, but it's very important to extract the most meaningful data from all the experimental results that we have. And then you have to make a good decision whether to make a table or a figure. Then, set the order of table and figure. Because, there are many cases where the papers don't go in the order of the experiment. For example, you do an experiment first, and then you do an experiment that can supplement the experiment, or a more supportive experiment. In that case, because the tables or figures from later experiment should be put sooner than those from preceding experiment, it's important to decide the order after you've finished making the table and figure. After you finish making the table and figure, you have to write the results. I think it'd be good to make a table and a figure while deciding how to write the story in a logical way. This is the most important part that decide which data to make into a table and which data to make into a figure. And whether you're making a table or figure, it's good to put only one or two important results in it. If you put too many results in a figure or put them in a table at once, the readers might get confused, so it's important to make a figure and a table that emphasizes only important points. Let's learn how to make a table first. Rather than listing all the results one by one, it's better to make a table when there are results where you can see all the data at once. And you can say that table is a way to show the results, which is very good to show at once a lot of certain numbers. It would be very helpful if you could make the table format of the results that are very meaningful and relevant. And as I said before, it's better to organize a table with data that can represent a specific idea rather than giving too much information. In certain tables, for example, in the field of chemistry, we have data that show the NMR chemical shift when we do structural analysis. Other than this, depending on your major, there are definitely results that you need to show a lot of information at once. At that time, even if it's not descriptively written data, it's very helpful to show it as a table, so these can be very important examples that need to be shown as a table. And for table, every table must have a number and a name. Table 1. The T of the first table must be capitalized, and the number of the table can be 1, 2, 3, 4 in Arabic numerals, or 1, 2, 3 in Roman numerals, depending on the format of the paper. You have to look carefully at the form of the paper you're going to submit. If there is Table 1 in the text, it must be mentioned somewhere in the text. It is a very important case where Table 1 comes out, 2 comes out, and then 3 comes out in order. For example, this is an example of a table in a very unusual situation. This figure is cut off at the top, but here are b, c, d, e. This is actually a table. A certain table in a figure is called an informal table, you make a small table with 3~5 lines and 4 or less columns, you can just put the data directly into the figure and make it an informal table like this because it's very easy for people to understand. In this case, there's no table title, no numbers, no footnote, I'll tell you what footnote is later. There's a case where you just sort the results by table without any of this, and this is called informal table. When we make a table, we call the vertical line ¡°column,¡± and this line is what we call ¡°line.¡± So this is a table that has 4 columns and 5 lines. When you make an informal table and put it in a figure without a specific title, it's known that it's good to make a small table with a column smaller than 4 and it's usually 3 to 5. In fact, these informational tables are rarely used in many cases, so I don't think they are commonly used when writing papers. But I told you because you might sometimes use it. Now, we're going to look at what we should do when we make a formal table. If you want to make a table, you need at least three related columns. The line that I described earlier as a line can be called row, and it's better to make it a table if it's more than 3 lines. For example, if you make two columns and two lines of table, it's this small? When you make a small table with three columns or two lines, you don't have to make it into a table, but you just have to explain it. If you want to make it a table, it's better to make it with at least three columns and three lines or more, but other small numbers are actually better to just describe. It's good to make the table simple and very concise. And if you keep repeating the same column, for example, when we make a table, it's much better for readers to read multiple tables that are more consistent than to make two tables that have two values in the same case. Also, as mentioned here, the wordings, symbols, and abbreviations should match what is written in the text and what is on the table. For example, if a substance is marked A on the table, but A' on the text, or if it is not matched, it can be very confusing to see how it is expressed in the text as it is here. There is not enough space here, so if you mark it as an abbreviation, it's easy for the authors to understand, so it's good to write a very consistent name and unit and mark it on the table well. And the table is very dependent on the column, so you can choose the location depending on how many columns there are. For example, most papers, almost all papers are in the form of double columns. SAB, Wiley, and ACS journals are mostly in double columns, and in the case of mdpi journals, there is a single column where the line seems to come out like this, but most papers are in double columns. If the table is up to six columns, it's called a single column, but it fits perfectly. The table with about six columns goes in here. But if it's over 13. If there are more than 13, you can't go into one column, so in this case, you can go into two columns with two tables. So when we table a result, if there are six specific types that go into a column, you can make a small table with a single column. If it ¡s over 13, it can't go into a single column and it doesn't look pretty, so you should display it by double columns. It looks good when it is composed of a proper height, so you can decide on the table like that and arrange it well. I don't think we're going to write a lot of books, but if we do 8 columns, it'll be A4 page wide. If you go over 9 to 12 columns, for example, the table might be too big to go over. Then you can turn this around and put the table in like this. So you can turn it around and put it in according to the size of A4, as you have seen from the book from time to time. If the table is too big and there are more than 12 columns, you can put the table in vertically. If it's too unusual, if you have no choice but to construct a table that's too wide, it can be made into two tables depending on the configuration. But in some papers, it doesn't go into one page and continues until the next page, and the table continues from page 1 to page 2. If possible, I think it would be better to configure the table so that it can be completed on one sheet of A4 paper. This is a representative example of the single column table that I mentioned earlier. This is an example of Table 2 among the papers consisting of two columns. You have to mark Table 2 and write the title very concisely. Table 2 should be mentioned at least once in the text. And there are 5 columns and 7 lines. As I explained earlier, I said that up to six can go into a single column. Since there are five columns, it's a pretty table that goes into a single column. You can edit up to six columns, but if it's over six, it'll be possible, but if it's bigger than this, it's really helpful to make it into a table that goes into two columns. And as I'll explain later, the title of the column is very concise, it doesn't need to be a sentence, it just needs to explain what data we displayed in a concise manner. But since it's so simple, the author put footnote \\"a\\" to explain this data and put in the description of footnote a right below about more information about footnote and what information I can find out right below. So this is the concept of using footnote. Because the title can't be too long. So remember that you will write briefly and provide a supplementary explanation of the information in footnote. That's how you organize the columns. And this is the representative NMR data that I explained earlier. Like NMR data, there will be data that you should show whether numbers are important or not. It's not about importance of data, like using NMR data no.35 because it's important, and not using data no.36 times because it's not important. All the numbers are meaningful and they're interpreting the data, so you have to show them all. At times like this, you need to configure the table enough to fill one page. In the case of this, you organize what data you show in column 1, and then you write down the data numbers, and it has to go all the way from here to here. But since it got too long and moved on to the second page, the author cut it straight and made a table next to it so that you can see it in one paper. Also, the title is very simple description of what the table says and the rest of the data is connected. Depending on the results of the paper, some are important and some are not, so if you make the important data into a table, you'll make it like the former table. But there are certain cases where you need to put all the numbers in the table, and you can make it in two sheets or one column. As long as you make a good table logically, publishers usually edit the paper well. So you don't have to worry about that. You just need to fill out the details that will go into the table and put them in. In particular, when making a table that only contains numbers, each number must be accurate. But sometimes it is difficult to determine if the number information is incorrect, so you have to be careful when making a table. And in the case of this table it has 8 columns. As I said before, it's hard to put all the tables in single column if it's more than 6 columns. The table has 8 columns, right? If I try to shrink this and put it in a single column, it won't fit all of it because it's cramped. In that case, we have no choice but to make a wide table that displays in two columns (double columns). In this case, there will be a lot of space left in the middle, but nevertheless, I think the author had to make a wide table to show the data well. You can make it into 2 columns (double column) or 1 column (single column). Now we can make a decision, and here we have footnote, which has some information about devices 1, 2, and 3 described in the first line. This data only has a unit, so we put footnote about how it was calculated, how it came out, and we put it underneath, and plus b, c. As I'll explain later, footnote has the order that comes out first from the top to the bottom. And you write it from left to right. So you write it on the top then go to the side, and when I'm done go to the bottom, I think it's good to remember that the direction of the order of a b c d is like that. And as I explained earlier, this is one paper. It's just one page, so you can think of it as a table. For example, this table has 11 columns. Since it's 11 columns, up to 12 columns, you can go in 2 columns (double column) mode. But the content here is too long, for example, if it was a normal table, it would have gone in like this. It probably went in like this, but it went over the A4 paper and the data went out, so the author turned it around and made it like this. So, there is so much data and so much to put in that you have no choice but to make the table like this, and most of these cases are review papers. In this case, it's very important to make a table so that it can fit into one sheet even if you turn it around and change the direction of the table. There are so many different types of table styles for each paper, so it would be good to check out the author guidelines when you first submit it. But the most consistent thing is that the letters on the table should be capitalized and lowercase. The letters are often arranged in the middle or on the left. Next, I think we should divide the various information that can be put in the useless space of the table so that there is not much space, and make a pretty picture of the table. In conclusion, I'm saying to design it well. As I said before, the best way is to put everything in one page. Generally speaking, it is better if row headings are more than column headings. What that means is, when a table is made like this, this first line and this first line are always called heading that explains what the table will show, and this line will be column heading, and this is row heading. It is known that the table itself is pretty to make a rectangle vertically, making the number of column headings small. Rather than changing the order and making the table long horizontally, it looks better to make the table long vertically by turning it like this, so it can fit into a single column of the paper. Nevertheless, there may be cases where tables are made like this. Of course, there could be. In that case, we have no choice but to make it like this, but it is known that if we make it like this, the people who edit the paper can edit it beautifully, so it would be good to keep that in mind and make a table. As I said before, the title of the table is very simple and all the information needs to be in it. So this doesn't have to be a sentence. Each title would be not a sentence. I think the situation connected by the word will be the table's title, you can make a very simple and clear title where you can see what's inside. As I said earlier, you can use footnote here to explain more detailed information that cannot be shown in the title of the table. And this is what I explained earlier, too. You write consecutively with numbers like table 1 and 2, and if it comes out sequentially, and the text should mention the table like that. This is also a typical example of a table. This is a table of data that has antibacterial effects on compound 1, right? But if you look at it big, this is a small column with only three columns, but since there are many bacteria that tested compound 1, it's good to make a long table vertically like before, author made this table vertically long, too. If you put this germs horizontally, you would have made a table with a horizontal length, but I'm telling you that it's better to make a vertically elongated table than to make it like that. And here is footnote. Author wrote penicillin here, and what's penicillin? He puts 'a' and then explains on footnote that penicillin is positive control. Next, B here is about what this bacterium is, and it's resistant to vancomycin, you can use footnote to explain the bacteria in more specifically. The important thing is a straddle rule, as you can see, there are 3 columns. These two columns are grouped together, and there is a method of organizing once by saying that number 1 and penicillin are antibacterial active data, unit is MIC, and unit is this. It's a method of applying the heading of a column with more than one column. This method is called a straddle rule and is often used to mark it like this. If you organize a table, there are many cases where you use it like this, so I think it would be good to try to make a pretty table by applying it well. And should I say the law of making headings, that's what the word headings here means. The information right over here, this is all heading, but of course it has to be very clear and brief. You can use any symbol or abbreviation here. Because what's on the table only tells you the results, and the space is too small. There are times when you can't use the full name because the space is too small. Then simply, as [1] is written for compound number 1. You can use it briefly like that, and you can use abbreviations. The heading of the column should match the one in the text. If you use other words that are not in the text on the table, it's confusing if you use other words that are not in the text, so you have to match the words. Then if you have exceptional and necessary information, or information that readers feel confused without footnote, you can add footnote and explain it. And the rest of the table has to match the same style. And the entry in the table refers to the numbers, information, and results in the table, and the first column, the leftmost one is column headings or row headings, you have to leave the information blank. And then there's Ditto. It's never going to happen, but what kind of example should I give you? For example, here's a device called A and a device called B, C, D, E. The performance of this device called A, a certain volt. Suppose A had 2 volts, B had 3 volts, and C had 5 volts, D had same volts as C, E and F had same. This is called a ditto, and no one uses this on a table. I'm not going to use this mark in my official paper. It's a given, so this is a sign that says Ditto. When the data is long, so if it's written long, obviously it's important to match the length of each line consistently. There are times when I use something like this. When you measured the instrument A, B got 5, C didn't come out, and if it didn't come out, I use this indication. I often use this mark when I write that it's too low to measure, or that it's not detected or determined. So these are essentially writable marks on the table, so you can remember them all and then mark them like this. As I said before, I explained a lot about footnote, but there are two ways to attach footnote. One is general footnote and one is specific footnote. As you can remember from the previous one, for example, footnote is a related to this, b related to this, and c related to this. This, this, this is the only one that applies. This is a specific footnote. If you look here, there's an [a]. There's an a in the entire title. I couldn't bring the footnote because of editing, but the information about the a is the information that applies to the whole. So you can think of that as a general footnote. This is a good example. The title of this table is an explanation of this. Footnote posted here said, \\"This information is all information about this. These are the numbers that apply to all of this,\\" it ¡s general footnote. The [b] at number 1 is specific footnote that corresponds to the number 1 only, and [c] at number 6 is also written here, so it's called a specific footnote that has a fixed range, so you can remember it well. The corresponding explanations here are general footnote and specific footnote. And footnote is different for each paper. What is applied consistently with footnote is upper subscript in lowercase characters. It's the basic form to write Italic. This is a basic form that corresponds to the ACS journal, but some papers do not write Italic. Most of them use Italic in upper subscript with lowercase letters. They are written in alphabetical order. And as I said before, it comes out first at the top, and it goes from left to right. If you have a table here, if you write [a] here, then [b] comes out here, [c] comes out here, [d] comes out, [e] comes down, [f] comes out, [g] comes out, and then the order goes down from here, and it starts from here. Please remember that the order goes like this. There is \\"ND,\\" an abbreviation for \\"not determined\\" in footnote. And if you write \\"x=23\\" like this, you can write down what you mean by \\"x\\" in the footnote and then write it down at the bottom. So you can do it like this. This is how you usually make a table. Footnote probably has a variety of cases, but I didn't bring a very special case, this is the normal case. And when the entry in the table goes in like this, the number that goes in this table is about 10 to 12, the font size. About 10 would be the best. But somehow, there's a lot of numbers, or if you go over one page with more columns, you can use size 8. Even if you reduce the number font size to 8, it's okay when you edit it. But if it's smaller than 8, it becomes too small. Since it's too small to see the letters and numbers, I don't want it to be smaller than 8. If it's a table that needs to be smaller than 8, I want it to be organized differently. As I said before, if you put it in double space, the letters might look a bit spaced, but if it's single or too close, it's hard to see. That's why it's good to use double space. This is a really good saying. You have to put only one piece of information in one line. I¡¯m telling you not to put multiple of these in a single cell. For example, there is a device called A. There's a device called B. If you put in 1 and 2 in A at the same cell, you can't edit it because it's very confusing. So you can't purposely put space or enter in between the lines. 1 and 2 in A, 3 in B, and 4 in C. There are 1 and 2 in A by enter button. Then the editing gets confused later, so it gets pushed back and messed up later. So this is really important. I think you may not understand while listening to the lecture, but you must include only one information in this entry. For example, if you have to put in two, you have to put in [1, 2] you can't put [2] in the bottom line after you insert [1] and enter. That's very important, so I hope you remember it well. Students make a lot of mistakes, so I think we need to be careful. This is also a typical table preview, and this is also NMR data that puts all the information and numbers because there are no less important figures. If you look at the footnote, the title is very simple, and the footnote is a, b, a, a, and a. This is a, followed by b, and then a can come out again. And then b can come out again. If it's going to be c, it should be after this, but there's no c. Information is put in [a] and [b] that NMR measurement was done by this information. And number 3 is the same information as A, so the author added A. That's why I marked it like this. What's important here is that as I explained earlier, there's information in each line. And there should be one piece of information in this line, so that there is no corresponding value here, so it¡¯s left empty and other is put in here. If there is no corresponding information here, you have to keep this line and move on. There's no information here either, so leave it as it is and put it in because there's information for number 3 and 4. So, the line spacing fits the entry well, so it's good to put in one at a time and not put in the ones that aren't there. You have to do that. And you have to put units. So you have to put in that this unit is a unit that applies to everything. I don't know what the thesis is here, but it's not written in Italic. It ¡s a characteristic that it ¡s not written in Italic. Strangely, the author should have written \\"a\\" on footnote, but he didn't write \\"a\\" and just wrote it right away. There's a style that you can use like this. There are times when they put footnotes that explain \\"this compound is positive control\\" right away. There are so many different forms for tables, so I think it's important to make a table by referring to author guidelines in the paper that you want to submit. Then, after the table, how to make a figure is very simple. Figure is a painting, so it's not very formal actually. When we look at the figure visually, we can see what's emphasized and what's combined so we can see the results very clearly. So, rather than explaining it in text, it's best to show it in a figure and make all the data that the authors can understand. There are many kinds of paintings. Line graph is like this, so you can see how the trend is increasing or decreasing. We use bar graph the most. Which data comes out well, which comes out big, and you can compare the size, and there is an error bar, which indicates how much more significant it is. I know pie graph too well. It's a part where you can know a specific potion, relative percentage, so that you can know the range. We use a lot of figures these days. The data that shows absolutely accurate information is put in figures. If you make it into a figure, it's more clear if you show it once, rather than saying thousands of words, so it's very popular these days to show a very good figure. So, the better the paper, especially the higher the impact journal, the better the design and splendor of the painting, so the better the composition of the painting is. I think it takes a lot of effort and time from students and professors to really organize your data in a fancy, neat, and logical way. Basically, if you look at good and bad examples, as you can see them well. Good and bad examples. It looks like a bad example. Because the drawing itself isn't pretty. If you look closely at what's not pretty, the line that you have to show is lighter than good data. It's kind of iffy to see what tendencies there are. These dots are big so that they're not scientific, right. It should be changed more concisely. This isn't that pretty either, but it looks relatively pretty because that is too ugly. This is kind of bad, too. The font isn't pretty. This is too big. I think it's kind of fancy, but it's tacky, right. So it should be made simple. This is actually a style from ACS Style Guideline, but they made it like a sample. The numbers we have to look at have too small numbers. Make the numbers bigger and make it look more concise. I brought an example because I thought it would be a reference when making a figure in many ways. If you look at this figure, it looks better than this one. Why does it look good? If you look closely, you can't tell what the bar graph means. There's not much difference in light and shade. So we can divide it into three colors: white, a bit darker, and much darker. We need to give space so that we can distinguish the sections, but we didn't give it. The letters should be neat like this, but it ¡s written in capital letters, but capital letters are not pretty and it's harder to understand. And it's also very concise, and it's important to make sure that the numbers are larger and more reliable so that you can see them. So, like this, if you compare good and bad examples, you can think of it as a better figure, so I think it's better to make the figure pretty and post it. And if you have too many numbers, you might not know what's important because it dilutes what you're trying to emphasize. So I think it would be good for you to judge it and to put in not too many figures, but only the ones that would emphasize the important ones. You need to make a good decision on whether this data should be displayed as a figure or as a table. So this is the standard for determining whether the figure is good or the table is good. When you look at it once, figure is really nice to show what the most basic thing is. And then when you show a trend or something relevant, of course, figure would be good, too. But if you want to show me the exact number, of course the table is good. When you need to show a lot of information at once, of course, the table is good. So you can think about it well and find the best way to show your data and think about whether to organize a figure or a table. In the past, I was told to use black and white. Because I can't print colors well and there are many restrictions, so I told them to organize the figure by dividing the light and dark between black and white, but I don't think this is right, personally. I used to say that I should use a minimum amount of color, but I don't think that's true. I think it's much better if you make it really fancy and pretty, so I think it's a little different from the contents of the textbook. In this case, it's a result that can't be expressed in a table. You have to express it in figures. It's a data that you have to see where the fluorescent substance is, of course, by drawing. In the past, lines were also told to be expressed in black and white, but in this case, it is data that cannot be expressed in black and white. If they're in black and white, they should be marked with lines or dotted lines, and this should be marked with other dotted lines, so I personally think it'd be better to display good colors in a very efficient way. Like this, I really expressed it with colors in a pretty way. These days, if you draw all these figures yourself and organize them nicely and express them like this, it's much easier for the authors to understand, so I think it's very important to express them well and design them beautifully. When you draw something like this, you can't take it from somewhere. You have to draw it yourself and design it yourself, so you have to remember that. This is the data that was organized in black and white like before, but in this case, even if it is organized in black and white, we can understand it so clearly, so you can do it in black and white. You can definitely use black and white for westerns. Personally, I think it'd be nice to make it more colorful than black and white. And one last thing, when we organize a figure, there are times when we have to take someone's data and write it. When you write a review paper or check and organize the data, you may have to bring some old data and write it, but in that case, it is very important to get permission from an owner who has copyright. Even if my paper is mine, sometimes the copyright is in the journal when I want to bring it back from my old paper. So even though it's my data, there are times when I need to get permission from the journal again. The only exception is known to be okay with what happens by the U.S government. So if you use the data you used before, there is this form. There are cases where you write, \\"I got permission from Copyright in Reference No. 10, so it's reprinted.\\" There's a form for each paper. You can check it out and use it like that. These things are also in the journal guidelines. So there is a format that uses it like this, so you can remember and use it. This is actually my thesis. It's a review paper, and this is a figure that we brought from Reference No. 33. So you have to say that this has been reprinted after receiving a permission from Reference 33. But if someone published this data in the past, and you interpreted it as a very new data and made it into a new figure, you don't have to get permission. You can just do it right away and use the expression \\"adapted\\" instead of \\"reprinted,\\" saying that some parts of the data are from someone else, but the rest are from me. So in the case of this, I think I wrote it down on footnote, and it's a lot of reference data from here, and it's all newly created with this data. You don't need permission to make it. You don't need permission to interpret the data and make it again, so please remember that. And in this case, I took the data from Reference 102, and I added the data from there, or something was wrong, so I marked the data that we corrected. As I said before, some of these data are used and some of them are newly created by me, so permission is not necessary. There are many cases like that in review papers, so it would be good to remember when writing such review papers. Today I talked about a lot of things because table and figure are very important and it got longer. Thank you so much for listening to me for a long time.","completion":"The summaries provided cover extensive ground on the components crucial for academic papers, focusing on how to write, structure, and present content effectively. Here are the key takeaways summarized from the discussions: 1. **Introduction to Academic Papers**: The essence of academic papers lies in their ability to communicate new findings, interpretations, or theoretical developments in a coherent and structured manner. The introduction typically sets the stage for the research by outlining the problem, its significance, and the study's objectives. 2. **Writing Process and Ethics**: Ethical considerations, such as avoiding plagiarism and ensuring accuracy in data representation, form the backbone of trustworthy academic writing. The process involves thorough literature reviews, efficient research methodologies, and clear, concise writing that adheres to ethical standards. 3. **Structure of Academic Papers**: A typical structure includes an introduction, methodology, results, and discussion (IMRaD). Each section serves a distinct purpose, from presenting the research question and methodology to reporting and interpreting findings. 4. **Titles and Abstracts**: Concise and informative titles alongside well-crafted abstracts are critically important. They offer a snapshot of the study's aims, methods, results, and implications, guiding readers to understand the paper's significance quickly. 5. **Introduction Section**: This section introduces the research topic, highlights its relevance, and sets the research question or hypothesis, providing background information to position the current study within the broader field. 6. **Methods and Materials/Theoretical Basis**: Detailed descriptions of the research design, materials used, and procedures followed enable reproducibility. For theoretical papers, a robust theoretical framework that supports the study's rationale is essential. 7. **Results and Discussion**: Presenting results in a clear, logical order without bias is vital, followed by a discussion that contextualizes these findings within the existing body of knowledge, addressing the study's implications and limitations. 8. **Conclusions and Further Research**: Conclusions succinctly summarize key findings and their importance, potentially offering directions for future research. 9. **Tables and Figures**: Effective use of tables and figures enhances understanding by visually summarizing complex data. Proper formatting and clear labeling are crucial for conveying information efficiently. 10. **Referencing and Citations**: Accurate referencing is paramount to acknowledge sources, avoid plagiarism, and guide readers to further information. 11. **Revisions and Peer Review**: Embracing constructive feedback from peer reviews and revising the manuscript accordingly is a fundamental part of the publication process, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and relevance.
