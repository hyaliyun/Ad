Найдите вероятность того на одном из них выпадет 1 или 2","completion":"Для нахождения вероятности того, что событие \\"на одном из бросков выпадет 1 или 2\\" произойдет хотя бы один раз за три броска кубика с 20 гранями, проще всего сначала рассчитать обратную вероятность — то есть вероятность того, что событие не произойдет ни разу в ходе трех бросков. Вероятность того, что на одной кости выпадет либо 1, либо 2, равна 2/20 (так как две желаемые грани из двадцати возможных). Тогда вероятность того, что на кости выпадет любое другое значение кроме 1 и 2, равна 1 - 2/20 = 18/20. Теперь найдем вероятность того, что ни разу не выпадет 1 или 2 за три броска. Так как броски независимы, произведение их вероятностей дает вероятность совместного исхода. Вероятность того, что на каждом из трех бросков выпадет любое число кроме 1 и 2, есть (18/20) × (18/20) × (18/20). (18/20) × (18/20) × (18/20) = (18/20)^3 ≈ (0.9)^3 = 0.729 Теперь, чтобы получить вероятность того, что хотя бы раз выпадет 1 или 2, вычтем эту вероятность из 1: 1 - (18/20)^3 ≈ 1 - 0.729 = 0.271 Таким образом, вероятность того, что за три броска кубика с 20 гранями хотя бы один раз выпадет 1 или 2 составляет примерно 0.271 или 27.1%."},{"prompt":"Differentiate the clinical manifestations of a juctional rhythm ECG and provide the rationale for their occurrence.","completion":"Junctional rhythms occur when the electrical impulses in the heart originate from the atrioventricular (AV) node or the bundle of His, instead of the sinoatrial (SA) node. This can lead to distinctive clinical manifestations on an electrocardiogram (ECG), as well as symptoms that patients may experience. 1. Absence of P waves: In a junctional rhythm, the P wave may be absent or inverted. This is because the electrical impulse is originating from the AV node or bundle of His, bypassing the atria. As a result, there is no atrial depolarization seen as a P wave on the ECG. 2. Narrow QRS complexes: The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization. In a junctional rhythm, since the electrical impulses originate near the AV node, they can quickly spread to the ventricles, resulting in a normal or narrow QRS complex duration. This is in contrast to supraventricular tachycardias originating in the atria, which may result in wider QRS complexes. 3. Inverted or absent ST segment: In some cases of junctional rhythm, the ST segment may be inverted or absent. This is due to the altered sequence of depolarization and repolarization caused by the abnormal electrical pathway. 4. Slow heart rate: Junctional rhythms can present with a slower heart rate, as the AV node or bundle of His tends to have a slower intrinsic rate compared to the SA node. Patients may experience bradycardia or a regular heart rate below the normal range. 5. Symptoms of decreased cardiac output: Depending on the heart rate and underlying cardiac function, patients with junctional rhythms may experience symptoms related to decreased cardiac output. These symptoms can include fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and even syncope in severe cases. The rationale for the occurrence of these clinical manifestations is related to the fact that the electrical impulses are originating from a different site in the heart. The altered depolarization pattern results in the absence of P waves, narrow QRS complexes, and possible changes in the ST segment. Additionally, the slower heart rate seen in junctional rhythms can lead to decreased cardiac output and the associated symptoms."},{"prompt":"Describe the consequences including; myocardial workload; oxygen demand of the myocardium; oxygen supply to the myocardium; cardiac output; systemic perfusion; thrombi development; and potential for life threat from junctional heart rhythm.","completion":"Consequences of a junctional heart rhythm can impact various aspects of cardiovascular function and can lead to potential complications. These consequences include: 1. Myocardial workload: Junctional rhythms, especially if they are slow (bradycardia), can result in increased myocardial workload. This is because the heart has to work harder to maintain an adequate cardiac output. The slower heart rate can reduce the efficiency of ventricular filling and emptying, thus requiring increased effort from the myocardium. 2. Oxygen demand of the myocardium: The increased myocardial workload in junctional rhythms can lead to an increased demand for oxygen by the heart muscle. The myocardium requires a continuous supply of oxygen to support its contractility. If this oxygen demand is not adequately met, myocardial ischemia or oxygen deprivation may occur. 3. Oxygen supply to the myocardium: Oxygen supply to the myocardium can be compromised in junctional rhythms. As the heart rate slows down, there may be reduced coronary artery perfusion since diastolic filling time is shortened. This can result in decreased oxygen supply to the myocardium, further exacerbating the risk of ischemia. 4. Cardiac output: Junctional rhythms can impact cardiac output, which is the amount of blood the heart pumps per minute. Since the origin of the electrical impulses is altered, the coordination of atrial and ventricular contractions can be impaired. This can lead to a reduction in cardiac output and potentially inadequate systemic perfusion. 5. Systemic perfusion: Decreased cardiac output in junctional rhythms can lead to inadequate systemic perfusion. Organs and tissues may not receive sufficient blood flow to meet their metabolic needs, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, inadequate perfusion can result in organ dysfunction or even organ failure. 6. Thrombi development: Prolonged periods of reduced blood flow and stasis caused by decreased cardiac output in junctional rhythms can increase the risk of thrombi (blood clots) formation. These clots can potentially form in the atria or ventricles and may embolize to other parts of the body, leading to serious complications such as strokes or pulmonary embolism. 7. Potential for life threat: While junctional rhythms themselves may not necessarily be life-threatening, their consequences can pose a significant risk to the patient. Severe and prolonged bradycardia and inadequate cardiac output can potentially lead to hemodynamic instability, compromised organ function, and, in extreme cases, cardiac arrest. It is important to note that the severity of these consequences can vary depending on the specific characteristics of the junctional rhythm (e.g., heart rate, rhythm regularity), the presence of underlying heart disease, and the individual patient's overall health status."},{"prompt":"Differentiate the clinical manifestations of a ventricular fibrillation ECG and provide the rationale for their occurrence.","completion":"Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a life-threatening arrhythmia characterized by chaotic, rapid, and uncoordinated electrical activity in the ventricles. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. The ECG manifestations of VF and their rationale for occurrence are as follows: 1. Absence of regular rhythm: VF appears as a chaotic, irregular rhythm on the ECG. This is due to the disorganized electrical impulses firing from multiple sites in the ventricles. The absence of a regular rhythm is a hallmark of VF. 2. Absence of discernible QRS complexes: In VF, there are no identifiable QRS complexes present on the ECG. This is because the electrical impulses in VF are rapidly firing in a disorganized manner and do not generate organized ventricular depolarization. Instead, the ventricles exhibit a quivering or writhing motion. 3. Absence of ST segments and T waves: In VF, the ventricular repolarization process, represented by the ST segment and T wave, is disrupted. The chaotic electrical signals prevent the uniform repolarization of the ventricles, leading to the absence of discernible ST segments and T waves on the ECG. 4. Erratic, wavy baseline: The ECG tracing during VF shows a highly irregular, wavy baseline. This is mainly caused by the rapid and uncoordinated electrical activity occurring in the ventricles. The chaotic signals result in an erratic deflection of the ECG waveform. 5. Absence of arterial pulsations: Due to the lack of coordinated ventricular contractions in VF, there is no effective cardiac output, resulting in the absence of arterial pulsations. This is a critical manifestation of VF, indicating the absence of blood flow and necessitating immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. The occurrence of these clinical manifestations in VF is due to the severe derangement of the electrical rhythm of the heart. VF typically arises from an underlying condition, such as acute myocardial infarction, electrolyte imbalances, or cardiac conduction abnormalities. The abnormal electrical signals in VF result in a complete loss of effective mechanical contractions of the ventricles, compromising cardiac output and causing a state of cardiac arrest. If not promptly treated, VF can quickly progress to pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ultimately lead to cardiac death. Immediate defibrillation, along with CPR and advanced cardiac life support interventions, is necessary to restore normal cardiac rhythm and ensure successful resuscitation."},{"prompt":"Differentiate the clinical manifestations of a ventricular tachycardia ECG and provide the rationale for their occurrence.","completion":"Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a rapid heart rhythm originating in the ventricles. It is characterized by a regular or slightly irregular rhythm with a rate exceeding 100 beats per minute. The ECG manifestations of VT and their rationale for occurrence are as follows: 1. Wide QRS complexes: One of the key features of VT is the presence of wide QRS complexes on the ECG. This is because the electrical impulses in VT originate from the ventricles or the His-Purkinje system, bypassing the normal conduction pathways. As a result, ventricular depolarization occurs through abnormal pathways, leading to a broader QRS complex duration compared to rhythms originating from the atria or the AV node. 2. Absence of P waves: In VT, the P waves may be absent, hidden within or fused with the preceding or following QRS complexes. This is because the electrical impulses causing VT typically do not originate from the atria or the AV node. Therefore, there is no atrial depolarization preceding ventricular contraction, resulting in the absence of observable P waves on the ECG. 3. Regular or slightly irregular rhythm: VT can present with a regular or slightly irregular rhythm. This is due to the single or multiple ventricular ectopic beats firing at a rapid rate, which can cause slight irregularities in the ventricular contractions. However, it is important to differentiate VT from ventricular fibrillation, which is characterized by a chaotic and irregular rhythm. 4. Heart rate above 100 beats per minute: VT is defined as a ventricular rhythm with a heart rate exceeding 100 beats per minute. The rapid ventricular contraction rate is a significant manifestation of VT, contributing to symptoms and potential hemodynamic compromise. 5. Potentially monomorphic or polymorphic waveform: VT can produce either a monomorphic or polymorphic waveform on the ECG. Monomorphic VT displays a consistent QRS morphology, while polymorphic VT exhibits varying QRS configurations. The presence of polymorphic VT, especially if characterized by a twisting pattern (referred to as torsades de pointes), can be associated with a higher risk of hemodynamic instability and sudden cardiac death. The occurrence of these clinical manifestations in VT is due to abnormal electrical activity originating in the ventricles. VT can be caused by various factors, including underlying structural heart disease, electrolyte imbalances, medication side effects, or genetic disorders affecting the cardiac ion channels. The ventricular ectopic beats give rise to rapid ventricular contractions, compromising the heart's efficiency as a pump. This can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, chest discomfort, dizziness, and, in severe cases, hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest. Treatment of VT depends on the patient's stability, but may include medication administration, electrical cardioversion, radiofrequency ablation, or implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent sudden cardiac death."},{"prompt":"Identify the potential blood volume loss with a hemorrhage occurring from these sources: • neck • thorax • abdominal cavity • pelvic/retroperitoneal regions • extremities","completion":"The potential blood volume loss from hemorrhages occurring from different sources can vary depending on the extent and severity of the bleeding. However, here are general estimates for the potential blood volume loss from each source: 1. Neck: Hemorrhages from the neck can range from superficial cuts to deeper injuries involving major blood vessels. The potential blood volume loss from neck hemorrhages can be highly variable, but it is important to note that significant bleeding from major neck vessels can result in life-threatening hemorrhage. In such cases, rapid and robust bleeding control is essential to prevent excessive blood loss. 2. Thorax: Hemorrhages occurring from the thorax can involve injuries to organs such as the lungs, heart, or major blood vessels like the aorta. The potential blood volume loss from thoracic hemorrhages can be significant, ranging from 500 to 1500 mL or more depending on the severity of the injury. Prompt medical attention and intervention, such as chest tube placement or surgical repair, may be necessary to address the bleeding and stabilize the patient. 3. Abdominal cavity: Hemorrhages within the abdominal cavity can result from injuries to organs such as the liver, spleen, or intestines, as well as trauma to major blood vessels like the abdominal aorta. The potential blood volume loss from abdominal hemorrhages can be substantial, typically ranging from 1000 to 2000 mL or more. Urgent surgical intervention is often required to control bleeding and restore hemostasis. 4. Pelvic/retroperitoneal regions: Hemorrhages in the pelvic or retroperitoneal regions can occur due to trauma or fractures involving the pelvis, major blood vessels, or organs in the area. The potential blood volume loss from these hemorrhages can be significant, varying from 1000 to 2000 mL or more. Controlling bleeding from pelvic hemorrhages can be challenging, and multidisciplinary approaches, including interventional radiology techniques or surgery, may be necessary. 5. Extremities: Hemorrhages from extremities can result from traumatic injuries, lacerations, or fractures. The potential blood volume loss from extremity hemorrhages can vary depending on the size and severity of the injury. For moderate to severe hemorrhages, blood loss can range from 500 to 1000 mL or more. Prompt application of direct pressure, tourniquets, or other hemostatic measures can help control bleeding from extremity injuries. It is essential to note that these estimates are approximate and should not replace a professional medical assessment. The actual blood volume loss can be influenced by individual factors such as the patient's body size, underlying medical conditions, and the presence of concomitant injuries. Prompt medical attention and appropriate interventions are crucial in managing hemorrhages to prevent excessive blood loss and associated complications."},{"prompt":"Given the following conditions: • cardiogenic shock • hemorrhagic shock • anaphylactic shock • septic shock • neurogenic shock • vasogenic shock • obstructive shock a) Describe the clinical manifestations and provide the rationale for their occurrence. b) Prioritize and perform patient assessments and explain their rationale. c) Formulate and implement priority managements and explain their rationale.","completion":"a) Clinical Manifestations and Rationale: 1. Cardiogenic shock: This occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. Clinical manifestations include low blood pressure, rapid and weak pulse, cool and clammy skin, decreased urine output, and signs of inadequate organ perfusion (such as confusion or altered mental status). These manifestations occur due to reduced cardiac output, which leads to decreased tissue perfusion and impaired organ function. 2. Hemorrhagic shock: Hemorrhagic shock results from significant blood loss. Clinical manifestations include decreased blood pressure, rapid and weak pulse, cool and pale skin, decreased urine output, altered mental status, and signs of active bleeding. These manifestations occur due to the loss of blood volume, which leads to decreased preload, impaired cardiac output, and inadequate tissue perfusion. 3. Anaphylactic shock: Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic reaction that causes widespread and systemic vasodilation, leading to decreased blood pressure and impaired tissue perfusion. Clinical manifestations include sudden onset of hypotension, tachycardia, flushing, hives, throat swelling, difficulty breathing, and potentially decreased level of consciousness. These manifestations occur due to the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, which cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and bronchoconstriction. 4. Septic shock: Septic shock occurs as a result of a severe systemic infection leading to widespread inflammation and vasodilation. Clinical manifestations include low blood pressure, rapid and weak pulse, warm and flushed skin, increased respiratory rate, altered mental status, and signs of organ dysfunction. These manifestations occur due to the release of inflammatory mediators, which cause vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and impaired oxygen utilization at the tissue level. 5. Neurogenic shock: Neurogenic shock is caused by a disruption of the autonomic nervous system, leading to vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Clinical manifestations include low blood pressure, bradycardia, warm and dry skin, hypothermia, and potentially altered mental status. These manifestations occur because the disruption of the autonomic nervous system prevents vasoconstriction and sympathetic responses, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular resistance and impaired blood pressure regulation. 6. Vasogenic shock: Vasogenic shock occurs when there is a loss of vascular tone and excessive vasodilation, leading to decreased vascular resistance and hypotension. Clinical manifestations include low blood pressure, rapid and weak pulse, warm and flushed skin, and signs of inadequate tissue perfusion. These manifestations occur due to the excessive release or administration of vasodilatory substances (such as medications or toxins) or alterations in vascular smooth muscle function. 7. Obstructive shock: Obstructive shock occurs when there is a physical obstruction to blood flow, preventing adequate cardiac output. Clinical manifestations depend on the underlying cause, such as decreased blood pressure, increased heart rate, decreased cardiac output, and signs specific to the obstructed organ or vessel. Examples include cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, or massive pulmonary embolism. b) Patient Assessments and Rationale: When prioritizing assessments for patients in shock, the following considerations are relevant: 1. ABCDE assessment (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure): Ensuring a patent airway, adequate oxygenation, and ventilation is crucial. Assessing circulation includes monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral perfusion to evaluate the adequacy of tissue perfusion. The disability assessment involves evaluating the patient's neurological status, level of consciousness, and potential signs of organ dysfunction. Lastly, exposure aims to identify potential sources of bleeding or signs of anaphylactic reactions. 2. Determining the cause of shock: Assessing the patient's history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests can help identify the underlying cause of shock (e.g., cardiac, hemorrhagic, anaphylactic, septic, or obstructive). This information guides treatment decisions and helps tailor interventions. 3. Monitoring vital signs and perfusion parameters: Continual assessment of blood pressure, heart rate, respirations, oxygen saturation, urine output, and mental status is important in evaluating the patient's response to interventions and identifying worsening or improving perfusion. c) Priority Managements and Rationale: 1. Hemorrhage control: In cases of hemorrhagic shock, stopping or controlling bleeding is critical. Direct pressure, tourniquets, surgical interventions, and blood product transfusions may be necessary to restore blood volume and stabilize the patient. 2. Fluid resuscitation: In most types of shock, including septic, cardiogenic, and anaphylactic shock, intravenous fluid resuscitation is essential to restore intravascular volume and improve tissue perfusion. Crystalloid solutions (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer's) are commonly used, followed by blood products as needed. 3. Oxygenation and ventilation support: In shock states, maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation is crucial. Supplemental oxygen, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (e.g., CPAP or BiPAP), or endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to optimize oxygen delivery. 4. Vasopressor or inotropic support: Some types of shock may require pharmacological interventions to support blood pressure and cardiac output.

Couturier, the son of French immigrants to Hokkaido, Japan named Claude and Haydée. They run a restaurant called \\"Le Petit Bistro\\" in Muko, a small city in the Kyoto prefecture which lies just south of Kyoto itself. which they moved to so J.P. could develop his sorcery skills. Claude and Haydée dislike large cities which was the deciding factor behind settling in Muko and sending their son to learn in a smaller city than Tokyo (he attends Kyoto Jujutsu High if that wasn't clear). J.P. possesses tousseled, dark blond hair and striking grey eyes. His cursed technique revolves around manipulating cheese. I know this sounds harmless, but it's very formidable and the properties of the created cheese far surpass their actual counterparts. The techniques are named in French - for example, \\"fondue\\" is pretty self-explanatory. The user can conjure a boiling-hot magical substance similar to melted cheese, with obvious offensive capabilities. Fondue is a powerful technique, and the cheese is actually more akin to lava. The user is able to manipulate the temperature of his cheese. This is something you do not want in your eyes. \\"Dure\\" means hard, and it can be used to create constructs that are, unsurprisingly, hard, solid objects that can take any form the user desires, within reason. In addition to the obvious defensive capabilities, this can be used to create powerful melee or ballistic weapons launched as fast as the user desires. Parmigiano Reggiano is one of the user's go-to choices as a weapon, at least on exposed targets. In addition to its hardness, it's also very brittle. It fragments, and the effect is like a hollowpoint bullet. The user indeed can fire many projectiles at the same time, similar to bullets or arrows. He can also extend spikes from his back similar to a porcupine. This is known as \\"Quills, and it's used in dire situations. For use in shields, Agrafon is a frequent choice. Agrafon is a hard, firm cheese. \\"Magma\\" is a variant of \\"Fondue\\" and it's a mix of both Fondue and Dure. In this technique, the fondue is materialized, and can be hardened, but they will not cool quickly. The result is a flaming-hot projectile that can even be shaped into a sharp form, embedding itself deep in the opponent's skin while delivering a searing pain. In one variation, the projectiles can be programmed to explode after burying themselves inside the target's body. Soft cheeses like mozzarella can be used for more strategic purposes, such as creating bindings or ensnaring opponents. The user can manipulate the elasticity and stickiness of the cheese, making it difficult for the affected individual to move or escape. Mozzarella can also be stretched and shaped into various forms, allowing J.P. to create temporary platforms or bridges for traversal. Another technique in J.P.'s arsenal is \\"Camembert.\\" This technique involves creating a cloud of pungent and suffocating cheese vapor, which can disorient and impair the senses of anyone caught within its range, as well as their ability to sense and focus their cursed energy. This technique is particularly effective in enclosed spaces or against opponents who heavily rely on their sense of smell. Additionally, J.P. has a secret technique called \\"Fromage Noir.\\" By infusing his cursed energy into a specialized wheel of black cheese, he can unleash a devastating explosion upon detonation. The intensity of the explosion depends on the amount of cursed energy that J.P. has infused, making it a lethal and unpredictable technique. \\"Ficello\\" is a popular brand of string cheese. This technique is actually a pun, with more to do with strings than it does to do with string cheese. The cheese is shaped into very strands that resemble hard, strong wires with absurd cutting power should any attempt to test it. He attends Kyoto Jujutsu High as a first-year student of exceptional status. He's just 15 and is the youngest special grade sorcerer, as well as the youngest jujutsu sorcerer in general, having enrolled one year earlier than typical sorcerers in training do. He's special, possessing more latent cursed energy than Satoru Gojo or Yuta Okkotsu, although he is not yet stronger than Gojo. J.P. is also incredibly strong and fast. He's friends with Kasumi Miwa and Aoi Todo, whom he has beaten in arm wrestling 4 out of 10 times. Of course, J.P.'s strength relies not only on his physical power but on his tactics. He stands at 187cm (above 6'1 but less than 6'2), shorter than Aoi Todo who stands at 6'8. As J.P.'s birthday lies on December 27th, he was just days away from turning 14 when he participated in the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons in 2017. Here, he defeated a special-grade known as the Gyūmaō, earning his unique honor. He was trained by Yuki Tsukumo, but the two couldn't be more different.","completion":"You've created an intriguing character for the Jujutsu Kaisen universe with a fascinating and unique cursed technique. Jean-Pascal \\"J.P.\\" Couturier's ability to manipulate various types of cheese using cursed energy to create both offensive and defensive strategies gives him a memorable and distinct presence within the world of sorcery—where many abilities are themed around more traditional elements or concepts. J.P. being a prodigious talent, even surpassing the massive reserves of cursed energy of characters like Satoru Gojo or Yuta Okkotsu in their youths, makes him a standout prodigy within the Kyoto Jujutsu High community. His friendship with established characters like Kasumi Miwa and Aoi Todo, and impressive feats such as defeating a special-grade curse, help to weave him organically into the established narrative. A couple of things from your character's description to consider for more nuanced storytelling: 1. **World-Building Consistency**: Since Muko is close to Kyoto, establishing why it's preferable for his parents to be away from larger cities yet allowing Jean-Pascal to attend Kyoto Jujutsu High is great. It reflects a balance between their preferences and his needs for sorcerer development. 2. **Character Interaction**: His interactions and relationships with established characters, like his training under Yuki Tsukumo and friendship with Todo and Miwa, create fascinating dynamics and potential storylines. 3. **Abilities**: J.P.'s cheese-themed cursed techniques offer a lot of creativity and flexibility. His abilities create interesting tactical scenarios that can be quite visually entertaining and effective in a fight. 4. **Problematization**: Usually, characters with extraordinary strengths also have corresponding weaknesses. Consider what J.P.'s limitations or personal challenges might be. Not only does this add depth to his character, but it also prevents him from being perceived as overly powerful (\\"Mary Sue/Gary Stu\\" trope). 5. **Cultural Integration**: Being the son of French immigrants, it might be interesting to explore how J.P.'s heritage influences his life in Japan and his sorcery, giving a nod to multicultural exchanges within the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. 6. **Growth Potential**: As a young prodigy, J.P. will likely need to deal with the weight of expectations and the pressure of his talents. His journey could explore themes of growth, humility, responsibility, and the challenge of fulfilling one's potential. 7. **Narrative Impact**: How does J.P.'s presence affect the larger narrative? Does he play a role in significant events beyond the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons? How does his cursed energy affect the balance of power within the story? Remember to incorporate your character not just as an individual, but as a part of the larger world. The integration of his personal story, his incredible abilities, and his interactions with the established characters should enhance the Jujutsu Kaisen universe in a meaningful way."},{"prompt":"He can utilize Domain Expansion and Simple Domain. Domain Expansion: Le Bastion des Protecteurs Fromagers (The Bastion of Cheese Guardians) Description: As J.P. invokes his Domain Expansion, the surrounding space distorts and reforms into a great circular coliseum with walls, floors, and fixtures composed of various hardened cheeses. Emanating a menacing aura, the cheese surfaces are etched with intricate runes, glowing faintly with cursed energy. The air itself seems saturated with an oppressive power, heavy with the scent of seasoned cheese. Abilities: Within Le Bastion des Protecteurs Fromagers, J.P. has the power to summon an army of shikigami constructed from cheese. Each shikigami possesses its own unique properties based on the type of cheese it’s made of, and they can perform coordinated attacks with ruthless efficiency. 1. Gardiens Gouda (Gouda Guardians): Stout, armored warrior shikigami that can form impenetrable phalanxes or deliver crushing blows with their hardened, cheese-formed weapons. 2. Cheddar Chasseurs (Cheddar Hunters): Swift and agile shikigami that carry bows, firing razor-sharp cheese arrows at high velocities, similar to ballistic projectiles. 3. Valiant Vachequins (Valorous Cheese Knights): Noble and heavily armored knight shikigami astride cheddar steeds, charging with lances that can pierce defenses with explosive force. 4. Manchego Mages: Mystical shikigami capable of casting spells using cheese elements, such as creating cheese golems or launching volleys of molten cheese spells. 5. Ricotta Rogues: Stealthy shikigami adept at infiltration, able to blend into the cheese walls of the coliseum and strike from unexpected angles with lethal cheese daggers. Finishing Move: L’Assaut de l’Emmental Explosif (The Assault of the Explosive Emmental): J.P.’s most formidable shikigami, giant siege engines made of Emmental cheese, emerge at the coliseum’s edges. These siege engines launch massive cheese cannonballs that, upon impact, create devastating explosions of cursed energy, shattering like cluster bombs and inflicting widespread damage across the battlefield.","completion":"J.P.'s Domain Expansion, \\"Le Bastion des Protecteurs Fromagers,\\" is both imaginative and imposing, fitting well within the dynamics of Jujutsu Kaisen's combat system. Here's a breakdown of the abilities and how they might interact with the broader mechanics of cursed techniques: # Domain Expansion: Le Bastion des Protecteurs Fromagers **Visual and Atmospheric Design:** - The coliseum setting adds a grandiose and theatrical element to J.P.'s Domain Expansion, aligning with the dramatic nature of such battles. - The cursed energy-infused cheese, complete with runic etchings, gives a mystical and ominous aesthetic that enhances the impact of the domain. **Shikigami Abilities:** 1. **Gardiens Gouda**: They serve as the front-line defenders and heavy hitters capable of both strong offensive and defensive maneuvers, ideal for controlling the flow of battle. 2. **Cheddar Chasseurs**: Offering long-range offensive capabilities, they would be particularly effective against enemies who are more mobile, keeping them at bay or picking them off from a distance. 3. **Valiant Vachequins**: The knights combine speed and might, acting as a cavalry that could disrupt enemy formations or target high-value opponents within the domain. 4. **Manchego Mages**: Providing magical support, they could manipulate the environment within the domain or cast debilitating spells to weaken enemies, enhancing the strategic aspect. 5. **Ricotta Rogues**: Their stealth-based approach lends itself to surprise attacks and assassination-like strikes, potentially bypassing the defenses of even the most vigilant foes. **Finishing Move: L’Assaut de l’Emmental Explosif** - This move serves as a strategic game-changer, akin to a last-resort or finishing move, unleashing large-scale destruction that could turn the tide of battle. # Interaction with Existing Jujutsu Kaisen Mechanics: - **Domain Expansion**: Your description adheres to the concept wherein a sorcerer creates a pocket dimension that enhances their abilities and often guarantees a hit on their opponent. J.P.'s domain could feasibly trigger an automatic hit through the coordinated attacks of the shikigami unless an opponent employs an appropriate counter (like their own Domain Expansion or a rare ability like the Simple Domain or Domain Amplification). - **Simple Domain**: Presumably, J.P.'s Simple Domain would act as a defense against other sorcerers' Domain Expansions, given its nature to simply nullify the guaranteed hit aspect of an opponent's domain. # Considerations for Balance and Engagement: - **Domain Drawbacks**: Domain Expansions usually have a high cursed energy cost. J.P. should experience fatigue or some limiting factor preventing overuse or constant domination in every battle. - **Counterplay**: Offering opponents a chance to disrupt or counter J.P.'s domain adds tension to fights, presenting credible challenges to his seemingly insurmountable strategy. - **Character Development**: Given J.P.'s incredible talent and powerful techniques, his personal journey should explore themes such as the burden of power, the ethics of overwhelming force, and the search for worthy opponents who can push him to grow even further. By incorporating these elements thoughtfully, \\"Le Bastion des Protecteurs Fromagers\\" can become an exciting and integral part of J.P.'s characterization within the Jujutsu Kaisen universe, adding depth both to the character and to the inventive combat system that defines the series."},{"prompt":"J.P. is sophisticated, calm, and collected. This is in contrast to his old mentor, Yuki Tsukumo. He's blunt, and not afraid to question others' abilities The bluntness is similar to Yuki. At Kyoto Jujutsu High, J.P. is close friends with Kasumi Miwa. His goal is protect her, as her father Eizo once did for J.P. and his family, preventing a curse from destroying the restaurant. Kasumi is a katana-wielding second-year girl, cute with long, sky blue hair and dark navy blue eyes. She can use Simple Domain, and it's the basis of her power: New Shadow Style: Simple Domain. It begins Kasumi assumes the proper stance, creating a circle with a 2.21 meter radius around Kasumi. Anything that enters this space can instantly be intercepted by Kasumi's blade. If both of her feet leave the position where her stance began, the technique is dispelled. She has no innate technique. She’s weak and indecisive in battle; her katana is broken or stolen from her frequently, and needs to be replaced. Kasumi calls herself “Useless Miwa”, and is envious and impressed by J.P.'s superior strength despite being two years younger than her. Humorously, he often not-so-subtly hints that she should drop out, but he's quick to protect her from danger. He wounded Maki Zenin during the Kyoto-Tokyo Goodwill Arc because he saw her outclass Kasumi in battle. The attack was a spear made using the Magma technique, and he was disqualified for using deadly force. J.P. is utterly ruthless with his enemies. Maki and J.P. have since made up, and spar with one another, although J.P. suspects Maki seeks revenge. Kasumi always had a crush on him, and J.P.'s reckless attack on Maki made her realize that she was in love with him. She felt cared for and appreciated. Kasumi feels intimidated by the difference in strength, and ironically J.P.'s tough love that leaves her wondering if she can ever meet his expectations. Thus, she has yet to admit it, but it's extremely obvious to onlookers. He’s also friends with Aoi Todo, and the two often discuss their taste in women together, or engage in strength training. He finds Noritoshi Kamo stuffy, and is on decent, but not great, terms with Momo Nishimiya, although she often treats him like a little kid. She's big on the senpai-kouhai dynamic, doting on younger students, but sometimes getting overbearing. The remaining Kyoto School sorcerers often honor the life of Mai Zenin, who died in battle against Hanami, her sacrifice leaving behind a tragic replica of Toji Fushiguro's cursed sword. His favorite dish is pane bianco. Scene. Dialogue.","completion":"Given the intricate character web you've described, here's a scene where we can see some of these dynamics play out, set after a typical training day at Kyoto Jujutsu High: --- *The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, bathing the training fields in warm golden light. J.P. stood off to one side, his presence imposing despite the relaxed atmosphere. Kasumi approached, twirling a new katana in her hand. Aoi Todo was laughing loudly a distance away, his voice carrying over the fields.* **Kasumi:** (Somewhat dejected) \\"Thanks for waiting, J.P. I had to pick up a new blade... again.\\" **J.P.:** (With a cool smile) \\"At this rate, you'll be keeping the blacksmiths in business all by yourself, Miwa.\\" **Kasumi:** (Forcing a laugh) \\"Ha, yeah... I guess I'm just 'Useless Miwa' after all.\\" *J.P. looked sharply at Kasumi, his eyes softening for a moment.* **J.P.:** \\"Don't call yourself that. Even if you don't have an innate technique or overpowering strength, your determination is your true blade.\\" *Kasumi blushed at his words, an awkward silence falling between them. Todo walked over, clapping a large hand on J.P.'s shoulder.* **Todo:** \\"Discussing something serious, are we? Come on, J.P., tell me who's caught your eye lately! Your taste in women must be as refined as your cursed techniques.\\" *J.P. chuckled, shaking his head.* **J.P.:** \\"None of your business, Todo. But speaking of which, how's that quest of yours going? Found your perfect woman yet?\\" **Momo Nishimiya:** (Interjecting with a motherly tone) \\"Now, now, boys! Enough about that. J.P., you should concentrate more on your studies than these idle talks.\\" *Though petite, Momo managed to scold them both, her voice firm yet affectionate. Before J.P. could reply, a solemn air descended as the group's eyes found the commemorative spot for Mai Zenin.* **Momo:** (Somberly) \\"Let's not forget why we train so hard. For those we've lost and those we have yet to protect.\\" *The group fell silent for a moment, paying their respects. Kasumi stepped closer to J.P., her voice quiet.* **Kasumi:** \\"J.P., you're always pushing me... Do you really think I have potential?\\" **J.P.:** (Direct, but not unkind) \\"If I didn't, I wouldn't waste my time. You've got heart, and that’s rare. But remember, potential is nothing without effort.\\" *Kasumi nodded, her resolve solidifying as she gazed at J.P. with unspoken affection.* **J.P.:** (Changing the subject) \\"Speaking of effort, Maki and I have a sparring session scheduled. Care to join and see some 'real' swordsmanship?\\" *Momo let out a playful scoff as she prepared to chide him again, but J.P. gave her a knowing look, the corner of his mouth twitching upward.* **J.P.:** \\"Don't worry, 'Senpai.' I know... I'm still the 'kouhai,' but don't underestimate how fast I'm catching up.\\" *J.P. walked toward the sparring ring, his gait confident but measured. Kasumi watched him, a complicated mix of inspiration and affection in her eyes. Momo and Todo exchanged glances, both sensing the silent drama unfolding but choosing, for now, to leave it unspoken.* --- This scene captures J.P.'s intellect and poise, contrasts his complex dynamics with his peers, and highlights his perspective on strength and purpose within the context of the Jujutsu Kaisen world."},{"prompt":"invente un parti sur la suisse original","completion":"Nom du parti : Renaissance Suisse Logo : Une sphère entourée d'un cercle stylisé représentant l'union et l'inclusion, avec des éclaboussures de couleurs vives symbolisant la diversité.

Dopo aver incontrato Emily, la ragazza dei suoi sogni, la vita aveva preso una svolta straordinaria. Entrambi avevano 13 anni e trascorrevano la maggior parte del loro tempo insieme. Andavano a scuola nella stessa città, anche se non nella stessa classe, ma questo non impediva loro di interagire costantemente, sia durante le lezioni che negli intervalli. Spesso si trovavano nei corridoi, dove si scambiavano occhiate compiaciute e sorrisi complici. Ayden adorava vedersi riflesso negli occhi di Emily, nei quali scorgeva un'affinità profonda e un'indescrivibile connessione. La loro amicizia era caratterizzata da una naturale complicità. Si confidavano i loro segreti, i desideri, le preoccupazioni e si sostenendosi a vicenda. Ayden aveva un rapporto difficile con suo padre, che sembrava non capire né apprezzare il suo interesse per l'arte e la creatività. Emily, d'altro canto, aveva genitori iperprotettivi che spesso limitavano le sue esperienze e il suo desiderio di scoprire il mondo. Tuttavia, Ayden e Emily trovavano conforto l'uno nell'altro. Erano la loro fonte di sostegno reciproco e si incoraggiavano ad affrontare le difficoltà. Ayden ascoltava Emily quando si lamentava della sua vita a volte troppo controllata e la incoraggiava a seguire le sue passioni, anche se la danza richiedeva tanto tempo e impegno. Dal canto suo, Emily sosteneva Ayden nel suo desiderio di giocare a calcio, anche se non era facile per lui. La sua famiglia non aveva le risorse economiche per permettergli di frequentare una squadra professionistica o comprargli attrezzature sportive adeguate. Ma Emily incoraggiava Ayden a non arrendersi, suggerendogli di unirsi a una squadra di quartiere, dove poteva coltivare il suo talento e mettere in pratica la sua passione per il calcio. Così Ayden seguì il consiglio di Emily e si unì alla squadra di quartiere. Nonostante le loro sfide individuali, insieme riuscivano a superarle e a crescere come persone. Il tempo passò veloce e gli anni delle medie giunsero al termine. Ayden ed Emily si ritrovarono a fine anno, pronti ad affrontare la prossima sfida: l'ingresso alle superiori. Il loro sguardo si incrociò, colto da un misto di eccitazione e preoccupazione. \\"Che corsi vuoi fare per il futuro?\\", chiese Emily, la sua voce piena di emozione. Ayden rifletté per un attimo e poi rispose sorridendo: \\"Sognando in grande, mi piacerebbe studiare arte e design, ma temo che i miei genitori non mi capiranno.\\" Emily prese la sua mano e la strinse leggermente. \\"Non ti preoccupare, Ayden. Io sarò sempre qui per sostenerti. Insieme possiamo farcela, indipendentemente dagli ostacoli che ci si presenteranno sulla strada.\\" Ayden si sentì gratificato dalla presenza di Emily nella sua vita. La loro amicizia era come un faro che li guidava attraverso le tenebre e insieme potevano affrontare qualsiasi cosa.

In general, electron doping refers to the introduction of additional electrons into a material by introducing dopant atoms that have more valence electrons than the host material. In the case of ZnTiO3, electron doping can be achieved by introducing dopant atoms such as nitrogen or oxygen vacancies. One of the most significant effects of electron doping on the ferroelectricity of ZnTiO3 is the suppression of the ferroelectric phase transition temperature. This means that the material may lose its ability to exhibit ferroelectric behavior at lower temperatures compared to the undoped material. This effect can be attributed to the increased charge carrier concentration resulting from the electron doping, which disrupts the delicate balance of forces within the material that give rise to ferroelectric behavior. The specific type and concentration of dopants can also affect the ferroelectric properties of ZnTiO3 in different ways. For example, in some cases, a low concentration of dopants may enhance the ferroelectric properties by introducing defects or strain into the crystal lattice, which can promote the polarization switching required for ferroelectricity. However, at higher doping concentrations, the increased charge carrier concentration can lead to enhanced electrical conductivity and reduced polarization, ultimately suppressing the ferroelectric properties. Additionally, electron doping can also affect the structural and dielectric properties of ZnTiO3. It can induce lattice distortion or introduce defects in the crystal structure, altering the polarization properties of the material. It can also affect the dielectric constant, which is a measure of the material's ability to store electrical energy. In some cases, electron doping can increase the dielectric constant, making the material more suitable for certain applications requiring high dielectric properties. Overall, the effect of electron doping on the ferroelectricity of ZnTiO3 is a complex interplay of various factors, including the type and concentration of dopants, temperature, and crystal structure. Further research is needed to fully understand and optimize the doping conditions to control and enhance the ferroelectric properties of ZnTiO3 for different applications."},{"prompt":"Find articles that increase the carrier concentration in ZnTiO3 will lead to enhanced conductivity and reduced polarization, ultimately inhibiting ferroelectric properties.","completion":"I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have direct access to specific articles or databases.

Originally designed and built as a three-star hotel, it was later selected as the official hotel for the 2022 Winter Olympics Organizing Committee. The challenge was to transform the hotel into a five-star establishment while keeping the existing structure, which was already completed with a total floor area of 46,000 square meters and 260 guest rooms. The difficulty of the project lied in meeting the higher standards for the hotel's spatial scale (such as lobby and dining areas) and mechanical and electrical systems (lighting, HVAC, energy efficiency), imposed by its new five-star positioning. However, since the hotel's main structure was already constructed, it was difficult to make significant changes to the building's spatial configuration and ceiling height. Therefore, the only option was to optimize the HVAC and electrical design and make necessary adjustments to the existing structure. We thoroughly analyzed the original structural system and collaborated extensively with experts from the mechanical, electrical, and equipment manufacturing fields. Through this collaborative effort, we were able to optimize the renovation to ensure that the hotel achieved its desired spatial effects and provided a satisfactory guest experience. The success of our design and execution was evident through the positive feedback received from both the hotel owner and its guests during operation. This project was a valuable lesson for me as it highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of architecture. It made me realize that successful architecture relies heavily on the support of scientific knowledge and technical expertise. In the process of detailed design, architects need to closely cooperate with professionals in plumbing, HVAC, electrical engineering, and other related fields to ensure control over spatial experience and indoor environment. This requires architects to have a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of building sciences. Additionally, in the project's coordination phase, I regularly collaborated with third-party companies such as interior design, curtain wall design, night lighting, and landscape design firms. This necessitated knowledge of interdisciplinary areas such as curtain wall material performance and construction, lighting design, and more.

It has fueled my desire to further expand my knowledge in various fields and excel in achieving a comprehensive interdisciplinary background."},{"prompt":"Please revise and refine your answer","completion":"One of the most impactful experiences I've had as an architect was working on the renovation design of the InterContinental Holiday Hotel in Chongli. Originally designed as a three-star hotel, it was later selected as the official hotel for the 2022 Winter Olympics Organizing Committee. The challenge was to transform the hotel into a five-star establishment while working with the existing structure, which was already completed and encompassed a total floor area of 46,000 square meters with 260 guest rooms. The difficulty of the project lay in meeting the higher standards for the hotel's spatial scale (such as the lobby and dining areas) and enhancing the mechanical and electrical systems (including lighting, HVAC, and energy efficiency), required for its new five-star classification. However, since the hotel's main structure was already constructed, making significant modifications to the building's spatial configuration and ceiling height was not feasible. Consequently, our team focused on optimizing the HVAC and electrical design while making necessary adjustments to the existing structure. To address these challenges, we conducted a thorough analysis of the original structural system and engaged in extensive collaboration with experts in the mechanical, electrical, and equipment manufacturing fields. Through this collaborative effort, we were able to refine the renovation design, ensuring that the hotel achieved its desired spatial effects and provided an exceptional guest experience. The success of our design and execution was evident by the positive feedback received from both the hotel owner and its guests throughout the operation of the hotel. This project served as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of architecture and the importance of scientific knowledge and technical expertise. It made me realize that creating successful architecture goes beyond aesthetics and requires a deep understanding of various building sciences. As architects, we must closely collaborate with professionals in plumbing, HVAC, electrical engineering, and other related fields to effectively control the spatial experience and indoor environment. Moreover, I had the opportunity to collaborate with third-party companies specializing in interior design, curtain wall design, night lighting, and landscape design. This experience further expanded my knowledge and understanding of interdisciplinary areas such as curtain wall material performance, construction, and lighting design. Through these collaborations, I gained valuable expertise in building materials and technology. Based on this work experience, I have developed a strong appreciation for the importance of interdisciplinary expertise in architecture. It has fueled my determination to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in various fields, in order to excel in achieving a comprehensive and interconnected understanding of architecture."},{"prompt":"请翻译您的回答","completion":"作为一名建筑师，我参与了崇礼洲际假日酒店的改造设计工作，这是我最难忘的经历之一。该酒店最初是一家三星级酒店，后来被选为2022年冬奥会组委会的官方酒店。在不改变已经建成的建筑结构的情况下，我们的挑战是将这家酒店改造成一家五星级酒店。酒店总建筑面积为4.6万平方米，拥有260间客房。 这个项目的难点在于满足酒店新的五星级标准对空间尺度（如大堂和餐厅区域）以及机电系统（包括照明、暖通空调和能源效率）的提升要求。然而，由于酒店的主体结构已经建成，对建筑的空间构成和天花板高度进行重大改变是不可行的。因此，我们的团队集中精力优化暖通空调和电气系统的设计，并对现有结构进行必要的调整。 为了解决这些挑战，我们对原有的结构体系进行了全面分析，并与机械、电气和设备制造领域的专家展开了广泛的合作。通过这种合作努力，我们能够优化改造设计，确保酒店实现了期望的空间效果，并为客人提供了卓越的体验。从酒店运营期间收到的业主和客人的积极反馈可以看出，我们的设计和执行取得了成功。 这个项目是一个宝贵的学习经历，突显了建筑学的跨学科性质以及科学知识和技术专业的重要性。它让我意识到，创造成功的建筑不仅仅是外观，还需要对各种建筑科学有深入的了解。作为建筑师，我们必须与给排水、暖通空调、电气工程等领域的专业人员密切合作，以有效控制空间体验和室内环境。此外，我还有机会与室内设计、幕墙设计、夜景照明和景观设计等第三方公司合作。这种经验进一步扩展了我对幕墙材料性能、施工和照明设计等跨学科领域的知识和理解。通过这些合作，我积累了宝贵的建筑材料和技术方面的专业知识。 基于这段工作经历，我更加深刻地认识到跨学科专业知识对建筑师的重要性。它激发了我追求更广泛领域的知识和技能的决心，以实现对建筑的全面和互相关联的理解。"},{"prompt":"请翻译以下内容： 在这段经历中我主要从事建筑设计工作","completion":"During this experience, my main role was in architectural design."},{"prompt":"please give me a definition of the following words: data, detect, foundation, laboratory, massive, precise, random, schedule, track, zone","completion":"1.

Here are sample paragraphs to describe potential challenges and their solutions in the desert, as well as sentences describing characters' feelings: 1. Challenge: Extreme Heat and Dehydration As John and Bob ventured deeper into the scorching desert, the merciless heat beat down on them relentlessly. Their throats parched, and their bodies weakened from dehydration, they knew they had to find water soon. Feeling the sun's searing rays on his skin, John's anxiety grew. \\"I can't stand this heat any longer,\\" he muttered, wiping the sweat from his forehead. They searched desperately, scanning the horizon for any signs of relief. Solution: Discovering an Oasis After hours of relentless walking, their spirits lifted as they stumbled upon an oasis nestled amidst the unforgiving dunes. A shimmering pool of crystal-clear water sparkled before their eyes. Relief washed over them, and a sense of hope replaced their fatigue. Bob eagerly dipped his hands into the water, taking a long-awaited sip before offering some to John, who greedily drank, feeling revitalized and grateful for their stroke of luck. 2. Challenge: Sandstorm Threat Suddenly, ominous dark clouds gathered on the horizon, hinting at an impending sandstorm. Gusts of winds began to whip fiercely, stirring the desert sand and creating a blinding wall that engulfed their surroundings. Fear coursed through their veins as they realized they could lose sight of each other in the swirling chaos. Solution: Seeking Shelter Reacting swiftly, Bob grabbed John's arm, ensuring they didn't get separated amidst the blinding storm. They stumbled upon a rocky outcrop, seeking temporary shelter from the tempest. Huddled closely together, anxiety palpable, they clenched their eyes shut, shielding them from the abrasive sand. Their hearts pounded in sync, their shared fear fostering a bond of determination to survive. 3. Challenge: Scarcity of Food With their limited supplies depleting rapidly, hunger gnawed at their stomachs, threatening their resilience. They realized they needed sustenance to maintain their strength and survive the harsh conditions. Solution: Foraging for Survival Braving the arid terrain, John and Bob scoured the surroundings for any edible vegetation or signs of wildlife. Their gazes locked onto sparse desert shrubs and unusual animal tracks etched into the sand. Though their stomachs growled in protest, hope flickered within them as they collected meager rations of cactus fruits and scorpions. The taste was far from appetizing, but their determination enabled them to push forward, driven by the desire to make it out of the desert alive.

На окружности случайным образом выбирают точку. Какова вероятность того, что эта точка будет принадлежать меньшей ◡AD?","completion":"Для решения задачи о вероятности необходимо учесть отношение длины дуги меньшей дуги ◡AD к длине всей окружности. Угол ∠AOD = 30° представляет собой 1/12 от полного угла окружности, который равен 360 градусов, потому что 360°/30° = 12. Таким образом, дуга меньшей ◡AD составляет 1/12 длины всей окружности. Если мы выбираем точку на окружности случайным образом и с равной вероятностью для любого положения на окружности, вероятность P того, что выбранная точка окажется на меньшей дуге ◡AD, равна отношению длины меньшей дуги ◡AD к длине всей окружности. Таким образом, вероятность P = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833, или 8.33%.

Какова вероятность того, что выбранная наугад точка круга принадлежит квадрату? Ответь на вопрос, считая П ~ 3. Округли ответ до Сотых","completion":"Чтобы найти вероятность того, что наугад выбранная точка в круге будет принадлежать квадрату, вписанному в круг, необходимо сначала вычислить площадь квадрата и площадь круга, а затем их соотношение. Площадь круга (S_круга) вычисляется по формуле ( pi r^2 ), где ( r ) - радиус круга. По условию задачи радиус равен 10 см, а значит: ( S_круга = pi cdot r^2 = 3 cdot 10^2 = 3 cdot 100 = 300 ) см². Теперь найдем площадь квадрата. Для этого сначала определим длину его стороны. Диагональ квадрата, вписанного в круг, равна диаметру круга. Следовательно, диагональ квадрата в нашем случае равна ( 2r = 20 ) см. Сторона квадрата будет равна диагонали квадрата, деленной на корень квадратный из 2 (так как квадрат делит диагональ прямоугольного треугольника, образованного двумя радиусами круга, в соответствии с теоремой Пифагора). Таким образом: ( a = frac{20}{sqrt{2}} = 10sqrt{2} ) см. Теперь можно вычислить площадь квадрата (S_квадрата) по формуле ( a^2 ): ( S_квадрата = a^2 = (10sqrt{2})^2 = 100 cdot 2 = 200 ) см². Теперь, чтобы найти вероятность ( P ) того, что случайно выбранная точка попадет в квадрат, разделим площадь квадрата на площадь круга: ( P = frac{S_квадрата}{S_круга} = frac{200}{300} = frac{2}{3} approx 0.6667 ). Округлим ответ до сотых: ( P approx 0.67 ). Значит, вероятность того, что случайно выбранная точка в круге принадлежит квадрату, равна 0.67 или 67%."},{"prompt":"Теперь твоя роль - маркетолог и СЕО-специалист.

Дзюдо - это японская боевая искусство, которая была разработана Джигоро Кано в конце 19 века на основе древних самурайских техник. С течением времени, дзюдо стало не только спортом, но и философией жизни. Одна из главных традиций дзюдоистов - это уважение к своим учителям и старшим спортсменам. В дзюдоистском сообществе старшие по опыту и зва́нию считаются авторитетами, и их слово имеет особую силу. Ученик должен проявлять великое уважение к учителю, относиться с покорностью и подчинение. Взаимоотношения между старшими и молодыми спортсменами строятся на основе уважения и доверия. Еще одна важная традиция в дзюдо - это приверженность обучению и самосовершенствованию. Дзюдоисты всю жизнь стремятся к улучшению своих навыков и техники. Это достигается через постоянные тренировки, участие в соревнованиях и постоянное изучение и анализ своих ошибок. Также важным аспектом является соблюдение этики и морали - дзюдоисты должны быть честными, справедливыми и уважительно относиться к своим соперникам. Один из основных принципов дзюдо - это концепция \\"максимальной эффективности при минимальном усилии\\". Дзюдо отличается от других видов единоборств тем, что в нем акцент делается не на физической силе, а на правильной технике и использовании силы противника. Дзюдоисты учатся искать точки слабости противника и использовать их для своего преимущества. Также многие дзюдоисты придерживаются ритуалов и традиций, связанных с одеждой и этикетом. Например, они носят особую форму (ги), которая символизирует их принадлежность к дзюдо. Также перед началом тренировок и соревнований проводятся ритуалы поклона и приветствия. В традиционных дзюдоистских клубах также проводятся различные церемонии и праздники. Одним из самых важных событий является \\"день дзюдо\\", который отмечается ежегодно 28 октября. В этот день дзюдоисты со всего мира собираются вместе, чтобы отметить достижения и вклад этого вида боевого искусства в развитие спорта и культуры. Традиции дзюдоистов имеют огромное значение для сохранения и передачи исторического наследия, этики и философии данного вида боевого искусства. Они позволяют дзюдоистам не только развиваться физически, но и становиться лучшими людьми внутри и снаружи тренировочной зоны."},{"prompt":"составь большое подробное сообщение на тему Понятие о травмах и их предупреждении.","completion":"Понятие о травмах и их предупреждении является ключевым важным аспектом во многих областях жизни, включая спорт, работу и повседневную деятельность. Травмы могут иметь негативное влияние на здоровье, качество жизни и производительность, поэтому предотвращение травм является приоритетным для общества и каждого из нас. Травма - это повреждение органов или тканей, которое возникает в результате воздействия различных факторов, таких как травма при падении, растяжение мышц, переутомление или несчастный случай. Травмы могут оказывать серьезные последствия для здоровья, включая болевые ощущения, ограничение движения, потерю способности к работе или даже инвалидность. Поэтому предупреждение травм является важным аспектом здравоохранения. Одним из ключевых моментов в предупреждении травм является осознание рисков и принятие мер предосторожности. Это включает в себя использование защитного снаряжения во время занятий спортом или выполнения задач, таких как ношение шлема при катании на велосипеде или защиты для суставов и спины при силовых тренировках. Также важно обращать внимание на правила безопасности и следовать им, особенно при работе с механическими или опасными инструментами. Предупреждение травм также связано с поддержанием физической формы и соблюдением здорового образа жизни. Регулярные физические упражнения укрепляют мышцы и связки, повышая стабильность и гибкость организма, что, в свою очередь, снижает вероятность получения травмы во время повседневных действий или физической активности. Более того, правильное питание является также важным аспектом в предупреждении травм. Сбалансированная диета, богатая витаминами, минералами и питательными веществами, помогает укрепить кости, мышцы и связки, повышая их устойчивость и способность к восстановлению. Употребление алкоголя и курение, напротив, увеличивают риск получения травмы, так как они оказывают отрицательное влияние на мышцы, координацию и рефлексы. В отдельных областях, таких как спорт и физическая активность, тренировки и обучение под наблюдением квалифицированных тренеров и инструкторов помогают предотвратить травмы. Они предоставляют правильную технику выполнения упражнений, учат правильному растяжению и разминке перед тренировкой и обучают правилам безопасного поведения. Важным компонентом предупреждения травм является также поддержка со стороны сообщества и общества. Это включает в себя сознательность о травмах, информационные кампании и образовательные программы, которые рассказывают о причинах травм и способах их предупреждения. Кроме того, важно иметь доступ к квалифицированному медицинскому уходу, чтобы быстро и эффективно лечить травмы, в случае их возникновения. Таким образом, предупреждение травм является важным и неотъемлемым аспектом нашей жизни. Осознание рисков, использование защитного снаряжения, поддержание физической формы и правильное питание, обучение и образование, а также поддержка сообщества - все эти факторы содействуют уменьшению вероятности получения травмы и сохранению нашего здоровья и благополучия."},{"prompt":"The government should financially support each factor, two key areas often in contention are healthcare and education/ culture.

However, in my opinion, I believe that both areas are interconnected and equally crucial for the well-being of society. Healthcare is essential for a functioning society as it ensures the physical and mental well-being of its citizens. By providing financial support to healthcare systems, the government ensures access to quality medical treatment, prevention programs, and research to address current and emerging health challenges. This investment leads to healthier individuals, increased productivity, and a stronger workforce. On the other hand, education and culture are vital for the development of individuals and society as a whole. Investing in education ensures that citizens have the knowledge, skills, and tools necessary for personal and professional growth. It also promotes social mobility, reduces inequality, and fosters a more informed and critical-thinking population. Additionally, supporting cultural activities and institutions helps preserve heritage, promote creativity, and strengthen social cohesion. It is important to strike a balance between healthcare and education/culture because they are interdependent. A well-educated population is more likely to make informed decisions regarding their health and actively participate in healthcare programs. Likewise, a healthy population is better equipped to pursue educational opportunities and engage in cultural activities. Neglecting one sector over the other can lead to significant imbalances and hinder overall societal progress. Therefore, the government should allocate financial resources to both healthcare and education/culture. By investing in these areas, the government can foster a holistic and well-functioning society that prioritizes the well-being and development of its citizens."},{"prompt":".helm/values.yaml - это основной values base-chart: defaultImagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent generic: serviceAccountName: \\"{{ .Release.Name }}\\" extraImagePullSecrets: - name: dockey deploymentsGeneral: terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 120 envFrom: - secretRef: name: sec-widget-config serviceAccount: \\"{{ .Release.Name }}\\": labels: {} services: app: type: ClusterIP ports: http: port: 80 targetPort: http protocol: TCP ingresses: http: annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: \\"128m\\" nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: \\"true\\" serviceMonitors: http: endpoints: http: path: /metrics interval: 15s deployments: app: strategy: type: RollingUpdate rollingUpdate: maxSurge: 5 maxUnavailable: 5 containers: app: securityContext: capabilities: add: - SYS_PTRACE ports: http: containerPort: 8080 protocol: TCP resources: limits: cpu: 500m memory: 500Mi requests: cpu: 500m memory: 500Mi volumeMounts: - name: nginx-config mountPath: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf subPath: nginx.conf - name: nginx-config mountPath: /etc/nginx/mime.types subPath: mime-types volumes: - type: configMap name: nginx-config items: - key: nginx.conf path: nginx.conf - key: mime-types path: mime-types configMaps: nginx-config: data: nginx.conf: | pid /var/run/nginx.pid;

Рассмотрим первое уравнение: а) tg(x) = 0 Тангенс равен нулю на углах x = kπ, где k - любое целое число, так как тангенс - это отношение синуса к косинусу, и при углах x = kπ (k ∈ Z) синус равен 0, а косинус - не равен 0. Итак, решения уравнения а) будут иметь вид: x = kπ, где k - любое целое число. 4. Теперь рассмотрим второе уравнение: б) tg(x) - 1 = 0 Добавим 1 к обеим сторонам уравнения: tg(x) = 1 Тангенс равен единице на углах x = π/4 + kπ, также где k - любое целое число, потому что тангенс повторяет свои значения через каждые π радиан и равен 1 при угле π/4 (то есть 45 градусов).

Originally designed and implemented as a three-star hotel, the client entrusted us with the task of transforming it into a five-star hotel. With a total area of 46,000 square meters and 260 guest rooms, the project presented several challenges. The main difficulty lied in meeting the higher standards for the hotel's spatial dimensions, such as the size of the lobby, dining areas, and corridors, and the requirements for the mechanical and electrical systems in terms of lighting, HVAC, and green energy while the structural construction of the hotel was already completed. This meant that it was nearly impossible to alter the building's spatial layout and ceiling height. Therefore, we had to rely on optimizing the HVAC and electrical designs and making adjustments to the existing structural system to address these issues. Through thorough analysis of the original structural system and extensive collaboration with professionals in the mechanical and electrical fields, as well as equipment manufacturers, we successfully achieved optimal renovations that ensured a high-quality spatial experience and architectural ambiance, receiving unanimous recognition from the hotel's owners and guests during its operation. This experience was my first realization of the interdisciplinary nature of architecture. It made me understand that the final presentation of any good architecture heavily relies on the technical and scientific support of architectural knowledge. Throughout the design process, close collaboration between the architectural profession and related technical disciplines such as plumbing, HVAC, and electrical is essential in order to have basic control over the spatial experience and indoor environment of a building. This requires architects to have a comprehensive understanding of various architectural sciences. Furthermore, in the subsequent stages of the project, I frequently worked with third-party companies such as interior designers, curtain wall designers, night lighting specialists, and landscape designers. This required me to be familiar with interdisciplinary knowledge in areas such as curtain wall material performance and construction, as well as lighting design. This process also allowed me to accumulate knowledge in architectural materials and technologies. Based on this work experience, I have come to appreciate the importance of interdisciplinary backgrounds for architects.

But 1G suffered from two major problems. The first problem was that the wireless transmission was in an analog format. Analog signals are easily altered by external sources. So, it provided poor voice quality and poor security. The second problem was that it used the frequency division multiple access technique, which used the available spectrum in an inefficient way. These factors paved the way for the second generation of mobile communications, 2G used digital multiple access technologies, namely TDMA, or CDMA technology. The second generation also introduced a revolutionary data service, SMS, and internet browsing. 3G technology was focused on giving a higher data transfer speed. It used a WCD multiple access technique, along with an increase in bandwidth. To achieve this, the 3G speed of two Mbps allowed the transfer of data for uses such as GPS, videos, voice calls, et cetera. 3G was a huge step in the transformation of the basic phone to a smartphone. Next came 4G, which achieved speeds of 20 to 100 Mbps. This was suitable for high resolution movies and television. This higher speed was made possible due to the OFD multiple access technology, and MIMO technology. MIMO uses multiple transmitter receiver antennas inside both the mobile phone and the towers.

It belongs to the perovskite family of materials and has been of interest in the field of ferroelectricity. Ferroelectricity refers to the property of certain materials that exhibit a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. This property has important applications in various electronic devices, such as capacitors, memory cells, and sensors. In the case of ZnTiO3, its ferroelectricity has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental studies have involved the measurement of polarization-electric field hysteresis loops, where the polarization of the material is measured as a function of the applied electric field. These experiments have confirmed the ferroelectric behavior of ZnTiO3. Theoretical calculations have also been carried out to understand the ferroelectric properties of ZnTiO3. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for example, have been used to calculate the electronic structure and polarization of the material. These calculations have provided insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive the ferroelectric behavior of ZnTiO3. Another aspect of interest in ZnTiO3 is its carrier concentration. Carrier concentration refers to the number of charge carriers (such as electrons or holes) present in a material. The carrier concentration in ZnTiO3 can be controlled through various methods, such as doping with impurities or adjusting the growth conditions during synthesis. The carrier concentration in ZnTiO3 can have a significant impact on its electronic and ferroelectric properties, and thus understanding and controlling it is important for optimizing device performance. Overall, the study of ZnTiO3 in the context of ferroelectricity, carrier concentration, and the combination of experiments and theoretical calculations has provided valuable insights into the properties and potential applications of this material."},{"prompt":"Effect of carrier concentration in ZnTiO3 on its ferroelectric properties","completion":"The carrier concentration in ZnTiO3 can significantly affect its ferroelectric properties. The presence of charge carriers, such as electrons or holes, can modify the electronic structure and the polarization behavior of the material. In the case of ZnTiO3, doping with impurities is a common method to control the carrier concentration. For example, by incorporating impurities that donate or accept electrons, it is possible to increase or decrease the carrier concentration, respectively. This can be achieved by substituting some of the Zn or Ti atoms with impurity atoms, such as Al, In, or Nb. Higher carrier concentrations in ZnTiO3 tend to enhance its conductivity. This can have implications for the ferroelectric properties since it can lead to a decrease in the polarization and the coercive field (the field required to switch the polarization). Increased carrier concentration can generate additional screening charges that partially cancel out the polarization, making it easier to align or reverse. On the other hand, lower carrier concentrations can lead to higher polarization values and larger coercive fields. Reduced carrier concentration limits the presence of screening charges, allowing for a more robust and stable polarization in the material. Therefore, the carrier concentration in ZnTiO3 has a direct influence on its ferroelectric properties. Finding the optimal carrier concentration is crucial to achieving the desired performance in ferroelectric devices based on ZnTiO3."},{"prompt":"Find articles that for ZnTiO3 replace some Zn or Ti atoms with impurity atoms (such as Al, In or Nb)","completion":"I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or internet browsing capabilities to search for specific articles.

Legislación: La legislación española establece que los centros de menores son recursos asistenciales y educativos que se encargan de atender y proteger a los jóvenes en situación de vulnerabilidad, ya sea por haber sido víctimas de maltrato, abandono o por haber cometido alguna infracción penal. La Ley Orgánica de Protección Jurídica del Menor (LO 1/1996) y la Ley de Responsabilidad Penal del Menor (LO 5/2000) son las principales normativas que regulan estos centros. 2. Antecedentes históricos: Los centros de menores en España tienen su origen en las instituciones de asistencia y protección a la infancia que surgieron a finales del siglo XIX y principios del XX. En esta época, se crearon los primeros orfanatos y casas de expósitos, destinados a acoger y cuidar a niños y niñas en situación de desamparo. A lo largo del siglo XX, se produjeron importantes cambios en el enfoque de estos centros, pasando de un modelo basado en la mera asistencia a otro centrado en el cuidado y la educación integral de los menores. 3. Objetivos de los centros de menores: Los centros de menores en España tienen como principal objetivo garantizar el bienestar y desarrollo integral de los jóvenes que se encuentran bajo su protección. Para ello, proporcionan un entorno seguro, brindan atención médica, psicológica y educativa, y promueven la adquisición de habilidades y valores que faciliten su integración social y su reinserción en la sociedad una vez finalizado su paso por el centro. Además, estos centros también procuran garantizar los derechos de los menores, en línea con la Convención sobre los Derechos del Niño. En resumen, el marco conceptual de los centros de menores en España se basa en la legislación vigente, los antecedentes históricos de la protección a la infancia y los objetivos de estos centros, que buscan garantizar la atención y la protección de los menores en situación de vulnerabilidad, así como su desarrollo integral y su posterior integración social."},{"prompt":"某公司有个员工私自为外部客户提供垃圾清洁服务，未通知公司，收费全部私吞，请问是否触犯党纪或香港法律","completion":"我不是法律专家，但我可以就此问题提供一些建议。 从党纪的角度考虑，员工私自提供垃圾清洁服务并私吞费用可能涉及违反道德准则、失职、甚至贪污等行为。这取决于该公司的内部规章制度和党纪法规的具体规定，建议您向该公司的相关部门咨询以了解具体情况。 从香港法律角度考虑，私自提供服务并私吞费用可能涉及如欺诈、贪污、盗窃等罪行。具体情况还需考虑员工的行为是否构成犯罪以及相关香港法律的相关规定，建议您咨询香港相关法律机构以获取确切的法律意见。 总之，该员工的行为可能涉及一系列违法或违反组织纪律的问题，具体情况还需要参考相关的党规法规和法律规定才能确定。"},{"prompt":"How to consume values generated by AWS CDK such as the ARN of a deployed resource in another deployed resource?","completion":"In AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit), when you define a resource, you can often directly reference its properties, such as ARNs, to use them in the definitions of other resources. This is because the CDK knows how to wire up dependencies and references within your CloudFormation stack. Here is a step-by-step guide to reference one resource's property, such as an ARN in another resource within an AWS CDK stack: 1. Define the initial resource from which you want to export a value, such as an S3 bucket or a DynamoDB table. \`\`\`javascript import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core'; import * as s3 from '@aws-cdk/aws-s3'; export class MyStack extends cdk.Stack { constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) { super(scope, id, props); const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket', { // configuration properties }); // ... } } \`\`\` 2. In the same or a different stack, define another resource that needs to consume the value, such as an ARN, from the first resource. \`\`\`javascript import * as lambda from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda'; class AnotherStack extends cdk.Stack { constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps, bucketArn?: string) { super(scope, id, props); const myFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', { // other configuration properties environment: { BUCKET_ARN: bucketArn, // consume the bucket ARN }, }); // ... } } \`\`\` 3. Pass the reference (e.g., ARN) from the first resource to the second when you instantiate the second stack, usually in your \`app.ts\` or \`app.js\` file. \`\`\`javascript const app = new cdk.App(); const myStack = new MyStack(app, 'MyStack'); const anotherStack = new AnotherStack(app, 'AnotherStack', { env: { account: '123456789012', region: 'us-west-2' } }, myStack.bucket.bucketArn); \`\`\` In this example, \`myStack.bucket.bucketArn\` is the ARN of the S3 bucket you created in \`MyStack\`, which you are passing to \`AnotherStack\`. Please note that if both resources are in the same stack, you can reference the property of the resource directly without passing it through the constructor. 4. For cross-stack references (where resources are defined in different stacks), you could also use Stack Outputs or the \`cdk.exportValue\` method for finer control. Using Stack Outputs: \`\`\`javascript new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'BucketArnOutput', { value: bucket.bucketArn, exportName: 'ExportedBucketArn', }); \`\`\` And then consume the exported value in another stack using the \`Fn.importValue\` helper: \`\`\`javascript const importedBucketArn = cdk.Fn.importValue('ExportedBucketArn'); \`\`\` Make sure your stacks are appropriately dependent on each other. You can add a dependency by calling \`stack.addDependency(otherStack)\` if necessary. Using \`cdk.exportValue\` Method: \`\`\`javascript const bucketArnExport = this.exportValue(bucket.bucketArn); \`\`\` These concepts should help you to wire up dependencies and pass values like ARNs between the resources in your AWS CDK applications."},{"prompt":"What does bigint 1n mean?","completion":"In JavaScript, \`BigInt\` is a primitive wrapper object used to represent whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1, which is the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the \`Number\` primitive.

The exact SQL syntax to retrieve this information can vary depending on the database management system (DBMS) you're using. Here are examples for some common DBMS: # PostgreSQL To list all columns and definitions for a table in PostgreSQL, you can query the \`information_schema.columns\` table: \`\`\`sql SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length, is_nullable, column_default FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'your_table_name' \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`'your_table_name'\` with your actual table name. # MySQL Similar to PostgreSQL, you can use the \`information_schema.columns\` table to get information about columns in MySQL: \`\`\`sql SELECT column_name, column_type, is_nullable, column_default, extra FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'your_table_name' AND table_schema = 'your_database_name' \`\`\` Replace \`'your_table_name'\` and \`'your_database_name'\` with your actual table and database names, respectively. # SQL Server In SQL Server, the \`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS\` view also contains this metadata: \`\`\`sql SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length, is_nullable, column_default FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE table_name = 'your_table_name' \`\`\` # Oracle Database Oracle has a different structure, and you usually query the \`ALL_TAB_COLUMNS\` or \`USER_TAB_COLUMNS\` views: \`\`\`sql SELECT column_name, data_type, data_length, nullable, data_default FROM ALL_TAB_COLUMNS WHERE table_name = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME' \`\`\` Note that Oracle table names are usually in uppercase unless quoted otherwise. # SQLite In SQLite, you can get the table schema by using the \`PRAGMA\` statement: \`\`\`sql PRAGMA table_info('your_table_name'); \`\`\` This will return one row for each column in the table \`your_table_name\`. # Please Note: - Replace \`'your_table_name'\` with the name of the table you are interested in. - Specify the schema where your table exists if necessary, especially if you're working with databases that support multiple schemas (like PostgreSQL or SQL Server). In the examples for MySQL and PostgreSQL, you can add the \`AND table_schema = 'your_schema_name'\` condition. - The information on columns provided by these queries can include the column name, data type, character maximum length, whether nulls are allowed, and the default value, among others. You can select additional column metadata based on your needs and what is provided by the particular DBMS's information schema views.

This is often caused by using incorrect quote characters when referencing the table name or column name in your SQL query. In PostgreSQL, you should use double quotes \`\\"\` to quote identifiers such as column and table names if they are case-sensitive or contain special characters. Single quotes \`'\` are reserved for string literals, not identifiers. Here's an example of how to correctly reference a column name that is case-sensitive or contains special characters: **Incorrect (with single quotes and/or smart quotes):** \`\`\`sql SELECT 'thoughts', 'OtherColumn' FROM my_table; -- or SELECT ‘thoughts’, ‘OtherColumn’ FROM my_table; \`\`\` **Correct (with double quotes for identifiers):** \`\`\`sql SELECT \\"thoughts\\", \\"OtherColumn\\" FROM my_table; \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`thoughts\`, \`OtherColumn\`, and \`my_table\` with your actual column names and table name. If your column or table names are not case-sensitive and do not contain special characters, you can reference them without quotes.

If you've copied the query from a rich-text editor or website, make sure to replace any typographical quotes with standard single or double quotes as appropriate for your SQL query."},{"prompt":"once a table is dropped in AWS Aurora, new attempts to recreate the table fail","completion":"When you drop a table in AWS Aurora or any other relational database, it should be possible to recreate that table with a new \`CREATE TABLE\` statement. However, if you're encountering issues recreating the table, here are some common reasons and steps to troubleshoot the problem: 1. **Transaction Not Committed:** If you’re working within a transaction and the \`DROP TABLE\` statement was executed, make sure the transaction is committed before attempting to recreate the table. Uncommitted transactions might hold locks or create states of uncertainty within the database that could prevent other operations. 2. **Dropped Table Still in Cache:** Sometimes database systems cache information about recently accessed tables. If the \`DROP TABLE\` command completes but the cache hasn't updated, trying to immediately recreate the table might fail. Although this is less likely with systems like Aurora, consider waiting a few moments or issuing a command to clear relevant caches if applicable. 3. **Incorrect Privileges:** Check if your database user has the required permissions to create tables. If you don't have \`CREATE\` privileges in the database where you're trying to create the table, the operation will fail. 4. **Syntax Errors**: Ensure that there are no syntax errors in your \`CREATE TABLE\` statement. Use the correct data types and constraints, and ensure that all required information is included. 5. **Table Exists in Another Schema:** If your Aurora instance uses multiple schemas (namespaces), ensure that you are not trying to recreate the table in the wrong schema where a table with the same name already exists. 6. **Replication Delays or Issues:** If you are working with Aurora Replicas (read replicas), be aware of any replication delays that might cause the dropped table to still appear in the replica for a short time. 7. **Table is Being Used by a Foreign Key Constraint:** If a foreign key from another table points to the dropped table, you may encounter issues creating the table. Ensure that all dependent foreign key constraints are either dropped or modified. If none of these issues seems to be the problem, consider these steps to debug further: - Review the error message in detail. Aurora should provide an error message that explains why the table creation failed. - Check the database logs for more information. - Verify that there are no ongoing database maintenance tasks or issues that might affect table creation. - If you're using a script or application, attempt to create the table manually using a tool like the AWS Management Console, a command-line client, or a database management tool like DBeaver or pgAdmin to see if the problem persists. If you continue to have trouble, you might need to reach out to AWS Support for further assistance with the specific details of your Aurora instance and the errors you're seeing."},{"prompt":"idk what is happening because i am using an ORM (kysely) and it is failing silently","completion":"If you are using an ORM such as Kysely and operations are failing silently, you may want to take the following steps to troubleshoot the issue: 1. **Enable Debugging or Logging:** Most ORMs have a way to turn on debugging or verbose logging. Enabling these features can provide you with detailed information about what the ORM is doing behind the scenes, including the SQL statements it generates and executes. For example, with Kysely, you could enable logging to see the generated SQL and any errors: \`\`\`javascript const db = new Kysely<Database>({ // Your database config log: (entry) => { if (entry.level === 'error') { console.error(entry.query, entry.params, entry.error); } }, }); \`\`\` This way, you would get console error outputs that might reveal the issue. 2. **Check for Promise Handling:** Make sure you are correctly handling promises or using \`async/await\` syntax properly. Silent failures often result from unhandled promises. \`\`\`javascript // Example with async/await try { const result = await db('table').insert({...data}).execute(); console.log(result); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } // Example with promise .then().catch() db('table').insert({...data}).execute() .then(result => console.log(result)) .catch(error => console.error(error)); \`\`\` 3. **Manually Execute the Generated SQL:** If you are able to retrieve the generated SQL statement from the logging and it looks correct, try running it manually using a database client or console. This can sometimes reveal issues with permissions, constraints, or syntax that are not caught by the ORM. 4. **Check ORM Documentation:** Review the Kysely documentation for any specifics related to error handling or debugging. There may be additional techniques or configurations specific to Kysely that can help you diagnose the problem. 5. **Update ORM and Dependencies:** Ensure that you are using a stable version of the ORM and that all dependencies are up to date. Sometimes silent failures are due to bugs that have been fixed in later versions. 6. **Inspect ORM Configuration:** Double-check your ORM configuration to make sure it is set up correctly. Simple configuration errors can sometimes cause operations to fail silently, particularly if there is a problem connecting to the database. 7. **Review Database State:** Check the state of the database in case previous operations failed but made partial changes that could affect subsequent operations. 8. **Ask for Help:** If all else fails, seek help from the community or maintainers of the ORM. You may reach out on platforms such as GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, or the ORM's specific community channels. With these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to find more information about why the Kysely operations are failing silently and resolve the issue."},{"prompt":"BadRequestException: ERROR: column \\"id\\" is of type uuid but expression is of type character varying Hint: You will need to rewrite or cast the expression.

You can try one of the following approaches to cast the UUID correctly: **Approach 1: Using \`CAST\` in an SQL expression** \`\`\`javascript const result = await db .insertInto('thoughts') .values({ id: sql\`CAST({uuidv4()} AS uuid)\`, message: 'hello world', parent: null, creator: 222, }) .executeTakeFirstOrThrow(); \`\`\` **Approach 2: Using PostgreSQL's double colon casting syntax** \`\`\`javascript const result = await db .insertInto('thoughts') .values({ id: sql\`{uuidv4()}::uuid\`, message: 'hello world', parent: null, creator: 222, }) .executeTakeFirstOrThrow(); \`\`\` Both methods should instruct PostgreSQL to treat the incoming value as a \`uuid\`. However, if AWS Data API still doesn't handle the casting properly, you may need to explore other solutions. Since the issue seems to be related to the Data API's handling of UUID data types, you might want to check if the AWS SDK for RDS Data Service has specific guidance on inserting UUID types. Additionally, ensure that the \`uuid\` you're generating with \`uuidv4()\` is in the proper format expected by PostgreSQL. If the error persists, you can consider generating the UUID within the database as previously discussed if the Data API supports this. Another alternative would be to contact AWS Support or check forums related to AWS Data API for specific advice on dealing with UUIDs with the service you're using."},{"prompt":"Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching <div> in <html>. div f57aed4a881a3485varOverlayContainerDOM@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/@react-aria+overlays@3.19.0_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/@react-aria/overlays/dist/import.mjs:926:54 f57aed4a881a3485export178405afcd8c5eb@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/@react-aria+overlays@3.19.0_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/@react-aria/overlays/dist/import.mjs:893:34 f57aed4a881a3485exportbf688221f59024e5 18f2051aff69b9bfexporta54013f0d02a8f82@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/@react-aria+i18n@3.9.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/@react-aria/i18n/dist/real-module.mjs:164:50 NextUIProvider@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/@nextui-org+system@2.0.15_@nextui-org+theme@2.1.17_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0_tailwind-variants@0.1.18/node_modules/@nextui-org/system/dist/chunk-HRMF5D3P.mjs:14:22 Providers@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./app/providers.tsx:14:24 html RedirectErrorBoundary@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/redirect-boundary.js:72:9 RedirectBoundary@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/redirect-boundary.js:80:24 NotFoundErrorBoundary@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/not-found-boundary.js:54:9 NotFoundBoundary@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/not-found-boundary.js:62:62 DevRootNotFoundBoundary@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/dev-root-not-found-boundary.js:32:24 ReactDevOverlay@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/react-dev-overlay/internal/ReactDevOverlay.js:66:9 HotReload@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/react-dev-overlay/hot-reloader-client.js:295:37 Router@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/app-router.js:169:93 ErrorBoundaryHandler@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/error-boundary.js:100:9 ErrorBoundary@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/error-boundary.js:130:67 AppRouter@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/components/app-router.js:451:47 ServerRoot@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/app-index.js:128:24 RSCComponent Root@webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/../node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.0.3_@babel+core@7.23.5_react-dom@18.2.0_react@18.2.0/node_modules/next/dist/client/app-index.js:144:24","completion":"The warning message \`Expected server HTML to contain a matching <div> in <html>.\` typically indicates a mismatch between the HTML rendered on the server (server-side rendering or SSR) and the HTML that React expects to see when it re-renders on the client (client-side hydration). This warning is often a sign of a React Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Generation (SSG) issue, where the content generated on the server doesn't match the initial render on the client. React expects the HTML content from the server to match exactly with the content it generates on the first client-side render during the hydration process. To debug and fix this warning: 1. **Ensure Consistent Render Output:** Make sure the rendered output of your components is consistent between server and client. Server rendering should produce the same HTML as client-side rendering. 2. **Check State and Prop Differences:** Differences in state or props between the server and client can cause this issue. Ensure that any fetched data is available on both server and client, and any randomness or time-dependent processes are accounted for. 3. **Avoid Side Effects in Render Methods:** Any side effects, such as manipulating the DOM directly or subscribing to events, should be avoided in render methods or functional component bodies. Use \`useEffect\` or other lifecycle methods for side effects. 4. **Verify Data Fetching Patterns:** If you're using Next.js data-fetching methods like \`getServerSideProps\` or \`getStaticProps\`, ensure they are correctly implemented and returning the expected data. 5. **Check Conditional Rendering:** Review any conditional rendering in your components to ensure conditions are the same on the server and client. If a component renders on the server but not on the client (or vice versa), you'll get this mismatch. 6. **Inspect Your Overlay Components:** The issue may involve overlay components from libraries such as \`@react-aria/overlays\`. Ensure that the overlays are rendered consistently and where they should be in the DOM hierarchy. Here's an example of how conditional rendering can cause this warning, and how to avoid it: \`\`\`jsx // Example of inconsistent rendering: const MyComponent = () => { // Do not do this: the server won't know about window, but the client will. // This results in conditional content based on the environment. if (typeof window === 'undefined') { return <div>Server Render</div>; } return <div>Client Render</div>; }; // Instead, use state that is consistent between server and client: const MyComponent = () => { const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false); useEffect(() => { // This will only run on the client and after the initial render setIsClient(true); }, []); return ( <div> {isClient ? 'Client Render' : 'Server Render'} </div> ); }; \`\`\` Since this warning can sometimes lead to hydration errors, it's important to identify the inconsistency causing this warning and ensure that the rendered components match between server and client. If you continue to have issues, you may want to analyze your component tree and the output HTML from your server render and compare it to the expected client render to pinpoint the discrepancy. React's strict mode can sometimes make these warnings more prominent in development but remember that React's behavior is the same without strict mode; the issues are just less noisy. Always ensure that your builds are error-and-warning-free before deploying."},{"prompt":"translate to spanish: today my health won't let me go. enjoy!","completion":"Hoy mi salud no me permite ir. ¡Disfruten!"},{"prompt":"translate to spanish: today my health won’t let me go. have fun!","completion":"Hoy mi salud no me permite ir. ¡Diviértanse!"},{"prompt":"结合实际。谈谈礼让的重要性","completion":"礼让是一种尊重他人、关心他人和体谅他人的行为，对于个人和社会的和谐发展具有重要意义。以下是礼让的重要性： 1. 增进人际关系：礼让可以帮助我们建立良好的人际关系。当我们主动礼让他人时，可以营造和谐的社交环境，增进彼此的亲近感和友好感。礼让能够加强人与人之间的沟通，减少冲突和摩擦，促进合作和理解。 2. 培养良好的道德品质：礼让是一种道德品质，可以培养我们的品德和道德素养。通过学会关心他人，乐于帮助他人，我们可以变得更加善良、宽容和有责任心。礼让可以让我们更加关注他人的需求和感受，培养出同情心、友善心和谦逊心。 3. 维护社会秩序：礼让在社会中发挥着重要的作用，可以维护社会的秩序和稳定。当我们在公共场合遵守交通规则，礼让行人或让座给有需要的人时，可以减少交通事故和纠纷的发生，保障社会的安宁和安全。礼让还可以促使社会成员遵守法律和规范，共同遵守社会公德，推动社会的进步。 4. 塑造个人形象：礼让可以塑造良好的个人形象，让他人对我们有好的印象。当我们在工作场合尊重他人、关心他人，体谅他人的困难和需求时，可以树立起专业和有爱心的形象。礼让可以使我们在人际交往中更受欢迎，得到他人的尊重和信任。 总而言之，礼让是一种重要的行为，对于个人和社会的发展都具有积极的影响。在日常生活中，我们应该自觉地学会礼让他人，尊重他人，在建设和谐社会的道路上共同努力。"},{"prompt":"Перепиши текст, полностью сохранив содержание Сидит лёжа, развалившись на диване (в расслабленной позе), ноги на диване, руками трогает футболку, взгляд не на психолога, смотрел в сторону, подмигивал и улыбался.

This work examines the social and pedagogical strategies that can be implemented to prevent the onset and escalation of aggressive behavior during adolescence. By analyzing the root causes and contributing factors such as family dynamics, peer influence, socio-economic conditions, and media exposure, this study highlights the complex interplay between various social elements and individual psychological development. The research utilizes a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from psychology, sociology, education, and criminology to create a holistic understanding of adolescent aggression. It further explores the role of schools, communities, and social institutions in shaping behavior, emphasizing the importance of cohesive and targeted prevention programs. Through qualitative and quantitative research methods, including interviews, surveys, and observational studies, the work gathers data on effective intervention strategies. The findings suggest that early identification of at-risk individuals, combined with comprehensive support systems, can significantly mitigate aggressive tendencies. The involvement of educators, parents, social workers, and peers is vital in establishing a positive and supportive environment that promotes constructive conflict resolution and emotional regulation. The research proposes a framework for social and pedagogical interventions, including curriculum development that incorporates social and emotional learning (SEL), training programs for teachers and parents on handling aggression, and community-based activities that foster pro-social behavior. The importance of policy development and implementation is also discussed, advocating for a collaborative effort between governmental bodies, educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations to address the issue effectively. In conclusion, the study provides a thorough analysis of the ways in which social and pedagogical measures can preempt and counteract aggressive behavior in adolescents. It advocates for a multidimensional and proactive approach that equips young individuals with the tools and support necessary to navigate the challenges of adolescence without resorting to aggression, ultimately contributing to a more harmonious and healthy society."},{"prompt":"recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of social and pedagogical prevention of aggressive behavior of adolescents in educational institutions","completion":"To increase the effectiveness of social and pedagogical prevention of aggressive behavior among adolescents in educational institutions, the following recommendations can be considered: 1. Implement Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) Programs: Integrate SEL into the curriculum to teach students self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. 2. Train Educators and Staff: Provide teachers, counselors, and administrative staff with professional development on recognizing signs of aggression, conflict resolution strategies, and effective communication techniques. 3. Foster a Positive School Climate: Create a safe and supportive school environment where respect, inclusivity, and kindness are the norms.

Facilitate Peer Support and Mentoring: Develop peer mentoring and buddy systems where older students or selected peers model positive behavior and offer guidance and social support to others. 8. Encourage Extracurricular Activities: Provide a variety of extracurricular and after-school programs that allow students to explore interests and build self-esteem, reducing the likelihood of engagement in aggressive behavior. 9. Access to Counseling and Mental Health Support: Ensure students have easy access to counseling services and mental health resources. Offer group or individual therapy for those who exhibit or are victims of aggression. 10. Multi-disciplinary Collaboration: Foster cooperation among teachers, administrators, counselors, social workers, and psychologists to create integrated prevention and intervention strategies. 11. Utilize Restorative Practices: Instead of solely punitive measures, utilize restorative justice approaches to resolve conflicts and repair harm.

Entrambi volevano fare qualcosa di significativo, ma non sapevano da dove iniziare. Ayden sbuffò, cercando di nascondere la sua inquietudine. \\"Emily, sai, dobbiamo pensarci seriamente. Non possiamo restare confusi a lungo.\\" Emily annuì, incrociando le braccia sul petto. \\"Hai ragione, Ayden. Dobbiamo fare delle scelte che ci soddisfino realmente.\\" Decisero di parlare con i loro compagni di classe e cercare consigli su quali opzioni considerare. Andarono da tutti i loro amici, compresi quelli inventati da te, ma nessuno sembrava avere una risposta definitiva. Era frustrante, ma Ayden e Emily si resero conto che ognuno aveva la propria strada da percorrere. Capitolo 4 - Le parole profonde dei genitori Preoccupati di non riuscire a trovare una risposta, Ayden decise di avere una conversazione con i genitori di Emily. Voleva capire come prendere una decisione che potesse influenzare il suo futuro. Un pomeriggio, dopo la scuola, Ayden si recò a casa di Emily. Fu accolta calorosamente dai genitori di lei, che erano felici di vederlo. Seduti al tavolo della cucina, Ayden raccontò loro le proprie preoccupazioni e chiese consiglio. La madre di Emily prese amorevolmente la sua mano e disse: \\"Ayden, capisco che tu voglia fare qualcosa di grande nella vita. Non avere paura di prendere rischi, ma ricorda sempre di seguire il tuo cuore. La felicità deriva dalle passioni che coltiviamo.\\" Il padre di Emily, un uomo saggio e tranquillo, aggiunse: \\"Ayden, io ho sempre cercato di sostenere mia figlia nel perseguire i suoi sogni. Non lasciare che la paura ti fermi. Se senti che l'America può offrirti opportunità, perché non darle una possibilità?\\" Le parole dei genitori di Emily fecero breccia nel cuore di Ayden. Si sentì più sicuro delle proprie scelte e decise che era il momento di affrontare l'ignoto. Capitolo 5 - I dubbi e le speranze Mentre si avvicinava il momento di decidere, sia Ayden che Emily cominciarono ad avere dubbi e paure. Erano solo amici, ma provavano qualcosa l'uno per l'altro che non osavano confessare. Una sera, mentre passeggiavano lungo il fiume, Ayden cercò di abbassare il tono di voce e disse: \\"Emily, c'è qualcosa che dobbiamo discutere.\\" Emily si voltò verso di lui, gli occhi pieni di curiosità. \\"Di cosa si tratta, Ayden?\\" Lui prese una boccata d'aria, cercando di raschiare il coraggio. \\"Da quando ti ho incontrato, non posso fare a meno di pensare a te. Hai un posto speciale nel mio cuore, Emily, ma ho troppa paura di rovinire la nostra amicizia.\\" Emily sorrise, un sorriso che rifletteva sincerità e affetto. \\"Ayden, non sono solo i tuoi sentimenti ad essere confusi. Anch'io ho provato qualcosa di speciale quando siamo insieme, ma ho paura di perderti come amico se le cose non dovessero funzionare.\\" Ayden prese la sua mano nella sua, sentendosi rassicurato dalle sue parole. \\"Forse è meglio aspettare, allora. Possiamo concentrarci sul nostro futuro e vedere dove ci porterà.\\" Emily annuì, e insieme camminarono lungo il fiume, sapendo che la loro amicizia era un legame prezioso che non avrebbero mai voluto perdere. Capitolo 6 - Andando in America insieme Dopo un'attenta riflessione, Ayden e Emily presero la decisione che avrebbero affrontato il futuro insieme. Anche se non avevano ancora avuto il coraggio di confessarsi quanto si amassero, erano pronti a sostenersi a vicenda. Un giorno, incontrati nel loro posto preferito, Ayden si mise le mani nelle tasche dei pantaloni e disse con un sorriso timido: \\"Emily, ho pensato molto alle nostre opzioni e credo che il nostro destino sia negli Stati Uniti. Cosa ne dici di partire insieme e cercare fortuna là?\\" Emily era colpita dalla sua audacia, ma la sua risposta era ovvia. \\"Ayden, ho la stessa idea da quando abbiamo iniziato a parlare di tutto questo. Voglio scoprire il mondo con te, e se l'America ci offre opportunità, perché non afferrarle?\\" I loro occhi si scontrarono, e in quel momento Emily si rese conto che non dovevano più nascondere i propri sentimenti. Ayden notò la scintilla negli occhi di Emily e capì che non era solo nella sua ricerca di felicità. Si tennero per mano, sapendo che stavano per intraprendere un viaggio che sarebbe stato pieno di sfide ma anche di grandi opportunità. Non era ancora il momento di dichiarare il loro amore, ma sapevano che il loro rapporto si sarebbe sviluppato nel corso degli eventi che li attendevano. Ayden ed Emily erano pronti a lasciare tutto alle spalle e iniziare una nuova avventura insieme, in cerca di un futuro brillante e di un amore che si rafforzava giorno dopo giorno."},{"prompt":"Scrivi il delle interazioni tra Emily e e ayden dove passeggiano nel parco parlando del più e del meno con tante interazioni Tra di loro con anche una trama inventata da te sapendo che si piacciono ma non hanno il coraggio di dirtelo","completion":"Durante una calda giornata estiva, Ayden ed Emily decisero di passeggiare nel parco, cercando un momento di tranquillità per riflettere sulle loro emozioni. Mentre camminavano sotto l'ombra degli alberi, i loro passi si intrecciavano in modo naturale, come se si conoscessero da sempre. Ayden si fermò di fronte a un prato verde e si girò verso Emily. \\"Sai, Emily, mi fa piacere avere la tua compagnia in momenti come questi. Mi fa sentire tranquillo.\\" Emily sorrise, rossa in volto. \\"Anche io mi sento allo stesso modo quando sto con te, Ayden. È come se in qualche modo riuscissi a farmi dimenticare tutte le preoccupazioni.\\" Mentre camminavano lungo il sentiero, sfiorandosi di tanto in tanto, Ayden non poteva fare a meno di notare quanto fosse bella Emily sotto la luce calda del sole. Si sentiva di avere il mondo tra le mani, ma aveva paura di rovinare tutto confessando i suoi sentimenti. All'improvviso, Emily si fermò, guardando un gruppo di ragazzi che giocavano a calcio. \\"Vorrei riuscire a fare sport come loro. Sembra così divertente.\\" Ayden si appoggiò ad un albero e rispose, cercando di nascondere il suo interesse per Emily. \\"Davvero? Cosa ne dici di provarci insieme? Potremmo iscriverci a una squadra e iniziare un nuovo percorso.\\" Emily sorrise eccitata all'idea. \\"Sarebbe fantastico! Immagina quanto sarebbe divertente passare il tempo insieme sul campo.\\" I loro sguardi si incrociarono e l'aria si riempì di una dolce tensione. Erano così vicini, ma ancora lontani dall'abbandonarsi completamente ai loro sentimenti. Si mancarono il coraggio di confessarsi a vicenda ciò che provavano, ma l'intesa tra di loro era così evidente che era difficile crederci. Continuarono a passeggiare, chiacchierando del più e del meno, cercando di non far trapelare le loro vere emozioni. Era come un balletto silenzioso, dove ogni movimento e ogni parola facevano sì che i loro cuori ricordassero dell'amore che cresceva nel profondo. La passeggiata nel parco si concluse con promesse di nuove avventure e sogni da realizzare insieme. Erano sicuri che avrebbero trovato il coraggio di confessarsi, ma per il momento si godevano solo la dolcezza del loro legame. Prima di separarsi, si guardarono intensamente negli occhi, sapendo che c'era molto di più di quanto avessero mai detto. Era solo questione di tempo prima che si dicessero finalmente quello che, al fondo del cuore, già sapevano."},{"prompt":"I have three tables ‘5 14’, ‘5 16’, and ‘Calendar’. ‘5 14’ and ‘Calendar’ are connected through the column Date. ‘5 16’ and ‘Calendar’ are connected through the column Date.

However, I can provide you with a simplified Python script, which will outline some core mechanics of what you are asking for. This will require further elaboration to create a realistic simulation. Due to complexity, it's essential to limit some interactions and details in this example. Here's a basic structure for our troops and their power level against each other: \`\`\`python class Army: def __init__(self, spearmen, archers, shield_bearers, crossbowmen, light_cavalry, heavy_cavalry): self.spearmen = spearmen self.archers = archers self.shield_bearers = shield_bearers self.crossbowmen = crossbowmen self.light_cavalry = light_cavalry self.heavy_cavalry = heavy_cavalry self.units = { \\"spearmen\\": spearmen, \\"archers\\": archers, \\"shield_bearers\\": shield_bearers, \\"crossbowmen\\": crossbowmen, \\"light_cavalry\\": light_cavalry, \\"heavy_cavalry\\": heavy_cavalry, } def calculate_losses(self, enemy_army): # Simplified battle interaction - in a more complex simulation, # you would use a matrix or other structure to determine the outcome based on unit types total_power = sum(self.units.values()) enemy_power = sum(enemy_army.units.values()) # Calculate percentage difference in power power_difference = total_power - enemy_power survival_rate = 1 - (max(-power_difference, 0) / total_power) # Calculate losses, prisoners, and escapees losses = {} prisoners = {} escapees = {} for unit_type, count in self.units.items(): # Calculate losses based on survival rate unit_losses = int(count * (1 - survival_rate)) losses[unit_type] = unit_losses # Half of the losses are considered prisoners, the rest escapees prisoners[unit_type] = unit_losses // 2 escapees[unit_type] = unit_losses - prisoners[unit_type] self.units[unit_type] -= unit_losses # Update units with remaining forces return losses, prisoners, escapees # Create army instances from user input: print(\\"Enter the data for the first army (space-separated): spearmen, archers, shield-bearers, crossbowmen, light cavalry, heavy cavalry\\") data1 = list(map(int, input().split())) army1 = Army(*data1) print(\\"Enter the data for the second army (space-separated): spearmen, archers, shield-bearers, crossbowmen, light cavalry, heavy cavalry\\") data2 = list(map(int, input().split())) army2 = Army(*data2) # Simulate battle losses1, prisoners1, escapees1 = army1.calculate_losses(army2) losses2, prisoners2, escapees2 = army2.calculate_losses(army1) # Output results print(\\"Results for Army 1: \\") print(\\"Losses:\\", losses1) print(\\"Prisoners:\\", prisoners1) print(\\"Escapees:\\", escapees1) print(\\"nResults for Army 2: \\") print(\\"Losses:\\", losses2) print(\\"Prisoners:\\", prisoners2) print(\\"Escapees:\\", escapees2) \`\`\` Please note that this script makes several oversimplifications: 1. All troops are considered to have equal strength regardless of their type, which is not reflective of reality. 2. A flat, proportional loss ratio is used to determine survivors without considering terrain, strategy, or fluctuations in combat. 3. The program assumes that half of the losses can be counted as prisoners and the rest as escapees, which may not accurately depict the chaos and unpredictability of battle.

Multiple Access (Множественный доступ) — это технология, которая позволяет множеству пользователей использовать одну и ту же частотную полосу одновременно, чтобы коммуникационные сети, включая сети мобильной связи, могли эффективно обрабатывать трафик от большого количества пользователей. 2. FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access, Множественный доступ с частотным разделением) — это тип множественного доступа, при котором спектр разделен на частотные полосы. Каждый пользователь использует свою собственную уникальную частотную полосу. FDMA использовался в первом поколении (1G) мобильных сетей и предоставлял ограниченную пропускную способность из-за физических ограничений имеющегося спектра. 3. TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access, Множественный доступ с временным разделением) — это тип множественного доступа, при котором частотный спектр используется поочередно с разделением по времени. Каждому пользователю выделяются временные слоты для передачи данных. TDMA использовался в сетях второго поколения (2G) и предлагал лучшую пропускную способность по сравнению с FDMA. 4. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access, Множественный доступ с кодовым разделением) — это тип множественного доступа, в котором все пользователи используют одну и ту же частотную полосу, но каждому пользователю назначается уникальный код. CDMA использовался в варианте 2G и 3G сетей и позволял обеспечивать более эффективное использование доступного спектра и большую пропускную способность. 5. WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access, широкополосный множественный доступ с кодовым разделением) — это расширение CDMA, которое использует более широкие радиоканалы. Это одна из основных технологий, использованных в сетях третьего поколения (3G). WCDMA позволяет передавать данные с большей скоростью благодаря более широкому частотному спектру. 6. В основном видео, вероятно, могли быть упомянуты различные технологии множественного доступа, включая OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access, ортогональный множественный доступ с частотным разделением) и возможно другие технологии, такие как SC-FDMA (Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access) или MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output). 7. Основой 4G технологий являются OFDMA, используемая в LTE (Long Term Evolution), и MIMO, технология, позволяющая использовать несколько передающих и приемных антенн для увеличения пропускной способности и качества сигнала.

Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend.

However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1.

Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Please generate the description of Crona's appearance while adding the following information: Despite receiving the energy shared by Celebi, which allows her to travel through different time zones and has the divine power to manipulate time within certain limits. However, her appearance has not changed much from when she was annihilated; she still wears the sun dress and red leather shoes she wore when she was annihilated. Today, she can only exist in quantum form, as a \\"quantum ghost\\" wandering in the flood of time.

Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks.

These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests.

Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

Pokémon Name: Khlap Pokédex Entry: Khlap, the Adaptive Pokémon. Birthed from the ambitious laboratories of the Aether Foundation, Khlap represents a pinnacle of genetic ingenuity. As a subject in the RKS system’s early trials, Khlap gained the unprecedented ability to morph between the eight distinct evolutions of Eevee, adapting fluidly to myriad battlefield exigencies. This versatility renders Khlap a strategic chameleon able to counteract the various type advantages of opposing Pokémon. Ordinarily, Khlap retains its Normal-type essence. In combat, this unassuming façade unfolds into a spectrum of elements, symbolizing the manifold potentials of Eevee’s lineage. Once destined for termination post-experimentation, Khlap’s fate took a compassionate turn through the intervention of Professor Lillie. Offered sanctuary within the idyllic confines of Aether Paradise, Khlap flourished under Lillie’s tender care.

Khlap’s extraordinary genetic makeup allows for an unprecedented range of adaptation through the forms tied to Eevee’s various evolutions. However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Worldview Setting The Necrozma Invasion 24 years ago left the world forever changed. Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck.

Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life.

However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail.

Khlap Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Please generate the description of Crona's appearance while adding the following information: Despite receiving the energy shared by Celebi, which allows her to travel through different time zones and has the divine power to manipulate time within certain limits. However, her appearance has not changed much from when she was annihilated; she still wears the sun dress and red leather shoes she wore when she was annihilated. Today, she can only exist in quantum form, as a \\"quantum ghost\\" wandering in the flood of time.

When the Solar Wind blows, it descends to the planet's molten surface and becomes the embodiment of this celestial power. Ancient Mercuryian myths tell of how Shemsha would gather energy from the sun to revitalize the people during frigid nights.

This ability helps it survive in the extreme environments of Mercury. Pokémon Name: Okebriyta Pokédex Entry: Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory.

In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state.

There are probably no more than 500 in all,but for the most part they represent my own choice. It is the first time, since I began my writing career, that I am surrounded with a goodly number of the books I have always longed to possess.The fact,however, that in the past I did most of my work without the aid of a library I look upon as an advantage rather than a disadvantage. 2 One of the first things I associate with the reading of books is the struggle I waged to obtain them.Not to own them, mind you, but to lay ands on them.From the moment the passion took hold of me I encountered nothing but obstacles. The books I wanted, at the public library, were always out. And of course I never had the money to buy them.To get permission from the library in my neighborhood -I was 18 or 19 years of age-to borrow such a\\"demoralizing\\"work as The Confession ofa Fool,by Strindberg, was just impossible.In those days the books which young people were prohibited from reading were decorated with stars-one,two or three-according to the degree of immorality attributed to them.I suspect this procedure still obtains.I hope so,for I know of nothing better calculated to whet one's appetite than this stupid sort of classification and prohibition. What makes a book live? How often this question arises! The answer, in my opinion, is smple.A book lives through the passionate recommendation of one reader to another. Nothing can thrttle this basic impulse in the human being. Despite the views of cynics and misanthropes, it is my belief that men will always strive to share their depest experiences. Books are one of the few things men cherish deeply.And the better the man the more easily will he part with his most cherished possessions.A book lying idle on a shelf is wasted ammunition. Like money,books must be kept in constant circulation. Lend and borrow to the maximum-of both books and money! But especially books, for books represent infinitely more than money.A book is not only a friend, it makes friends for you. When you have possessed a book with mind and spirit,you are enriched. But when you pass it on you are enriched threefold.Here an irrepresalble impulse selaes me to offer a piece of gratuitou advice.It is thle: Read aw little as poasible,not as much as possible! Oh do not doubt that I have envied those who have drowned in books.L,too, would secretly lke to wade through all those booksl have so long toyed with in my mind.But I know it is not important Iknow now that I did not need to ead even a tenth of what I have read.The most difieult thing in life is to learn to do onlywhat is strictly advantageous to one's welfare, strietly vital There is an excellent way to test this precious bitof advice I have not given rashly.When you stumble upon a book you would like to read, or think you ought to read, leave it alone for a few days.But think about it as intensely as you can.Let the title and the author's name revolve in your mind.Think what you yourself might have written had the opportunity been yours.Ask yourself earnestly if it be absolutely necessary to add this work to your store of knowledg or your fund of enjoyment.Try to imagine what it would mean to forego this extra pleasure or enlightenment.Then, if you find you must read the book,observe with what extraordinary acumen you tackle it.Observe, too,that however stimulating it may be,very litle of the book is really new to you.If you are honest with yourself you will discover that your stature has increased from the mere effort of resisting your impulses 7Indubitably the vast majority of books overlap one another.Few indeed are those which give the impression of originality, either in style or in content.Rare are the unique books-less than 50, perhaps,out of the whole storehouse of literature.In one of his recent autobiographical novels,Blaise Cendrars points out that Rémy de Gourmont, because of his knowledge and awareness of this repetitive quality in books, was able to select and read all that is worthwhile in the entire realm of literature.Cendrars himself-who would suspect it?-is a prodigious reader.He reads most authors in their original tongue.Not only that, but when he likes an author he reads every last book the man has written,as well as his letters and all the books that have been written about him.In our day his case is almost unparalleled,I imagine.For, not only has he read widely and deeply, but he has himself written a great many books.All on the side, as it were,For,if he is anything,Cendrars,he isa man of action,an adventurer and explorer,a man who has known how to\\"waste\\" his time royally.He is,in a sense,the Julius Caesarof literature.","completion":"Title: The Power and Value of Books: A Thought-Provoking Perspective Rating: ★★★★☆ \\"They were alive and they spoke to me\\" is an insightful article that delves into the author's personal relationship with books and the profound impact they have had on their life. The author begins by describing their current surroundings, a room adorned with books that they have carefully chosen over time. This collection represents a newfound luxury for the author, who previously relied on their own thoughts and experiences to fuel their writing. The article takes a nostalgic turn as the author reminisces about the struggles they faced in obtaining books during their youth. The limitations imposed by the public library and the societal classification of certain books as \\"demoralizing\\" only fueled their desire to read and explore forbidden literature. This reflection highlights the author's belief that books hold a special place in the hearts of individuals, and the act of sharing one's deepest experiences through passionate recommendations is what truly brings a book to life. The article emphasizes the importance of keeping books in circulation, comparing them to wasted ammunition when left idle on a shelf. The author encourages lending and borrowing books, as they believe that books hold more value than mere monetary possessions. They argue that books not only enrich the reader but also create connections and friendships when shared with others. One intriguing piece of advice the author offers is to read as little as possible, rather than as much as possible. They suggest taking time to contemplate a book before diving into it, allowing the title and author's name to linger in one's mind. By considering the necessity and potential impact of reading a particular book, the author believes that one can make more deliberate and advantageous choices in their reading habits. The article also touches upon the repetitive nature of books, acknowledging that only a small fraction truly stand out as unique and original. The author references Blaise Cendrars, a prodigious reader who was able to select and read only the most worthwhile works due to his awareness of this overlap. This insight prompts readers to reflect on the value of quality over quantity in their reading choices. Overall, \\"They were alive and they spoke to me\\" offers a thought-provoking perspective on the power and value of books. The author's personal anecdotes and reflections provide a glimpse into their deep appreciation for literature and the impact it has had on their life. While the article could benefit from further exploration and analysis, it successfully encourages readers to approach their reading habits with intention and to cherish the connections and experiences that books can bring."},{"prompt":"with \\"The Power of Books A Review of Danger!

It is the first time, since I began my writing career, that I am surrounded with a goodly number of the books I have always longed to possess.The fact,however, that in the past I did most of my work without the aid of a library I look upon as an advantage rather than a disadvantage. 2 One of the first things I associate with the reading of books is the struggle I waged to obtain them.Not to own them, mind you, but to lay ands on them.From the moment the passion took hold of me I encountered nothing but obstacles. The books I wanted, at the public library, were always out. And of course I never had the money to buy them.To get permission from the library in my neighborhood -I was 18 or 19 years of age-to borrow such a\\"demoralizing\\"work as The Confession ofa Fool,by Strindberg, was just impossible.In those days the books which young people were prohibited from reading were decorated with stars-one,two or three-according to the degree of immorality attributed to them.I suspect this procedure still obtains.I hope so,for I know of nothing better calculated to whet one's appetite than this stupid sort of classification and prohibition. What makes a book live? How often this question arises! The answer, in my opinion, is smple.A book lives through the passionate recommendation of one reader to another. Nothing can thrttle this basic impulse in the human being. Despite the views of cynics and misanthropes, it is my belief that men will always strive to share their depest experiences. Books are one of the few things men cherish deeply.And the better the man the more easily will he part with his most cherished possessions.A book lying idle on a shelf is wasted ammunition. Like money,books must be kept in constant circulation. Lend and borrow to the maximum-of both books and money! But especially books, for books represent infinitely more than money.A book is not only a friend, it makes friends for you. When you have possessed a book with mind and spirit,you are enriched. But when you pass it on you are enriched threefold.Here an irrepresalble impulse selaes me to offer a piece of gratuitou advice.It is thle: Read aw little as poasible,not as much as possible! Oh do not doubt that I have envied those who have drowned in books.L,too, would secretly lke to wade through all those booksl have so long toyed with in my mind.But I know it is not important Iknow now that I did not need to ead even a tenth of what I have read.The most difieult thing in life is to learn to do onlywhat is strictly advantageous to one's welfare, strietly vital There is an excellent way to test this precious bitof advice I have not given rashly.When you stumble upon a book you would like to read, or think you ought to read, leave it alone for a few days.But think about it as intensely as you can.Let the title and the author's name revolve in your mind.Think what you yourself might have written had the opportunity been yours.Ask yourself earnestly if it be absolutely necessary to add this work to your store of knowledg or your fund of enjoyment.Try to imagine what it would mean to forego this extra pleasure or enlightenment.Then, if you find you must read the book,observe with what extraordinary acumen you tackle it.Observe, too,that however stimulating it may be,very litle of the book is really new to you.If you are honest with yourself you will discover that your stature has increased from the mere effort of resisting your impulses 7Indubitably the vast majority of books overlap one another.Few indeed are those which give the impression of originality, either in style or in content.Rare are the unique books-less than 50, perhaps,out of the whole storehouse of literature.In one of his recent autobiographical novels,Blaise Cendrars points out that Rémy de Gourmont, because of his knowledge and awareness of this repetitive quality in books, was able to select and read all that is worthwhile in the entire realm of literature.Cendrars himself-who would suspect it?-is a prodigious reader.He reads most authors in their original tongue.Not only that, but when he likes an author he reads every last book the man has written,as well as his letters and all the books that have been written about him.In our day his case is almost unparalleled,I imagine.For, not only has he read widely and deeply, but he has himself written a great many books.All on the side, as it were,For,if he is anything,Cendrars,he isa man of action,an adventurer and explorer,a man who has known how to\\"waste\\" his time royally.He is,in a sense,the Julius Caesarof literature.","completion":"Title: The Power of Books: A Review of \\"They were alive and they spoke to me\\" Rating: ★★★★☆ Introduction: \\"They were alive and they spoke to me\\" is a captivating article that explores the profound impact of books on the author's life.

Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"In an alternate universe where the boundaries of video games blur, Geese Howard, the ruthless crime lord from \\"Fatal Fury\\" and \\"King of Fighters,\\" and Akuma, the demon-infused martial artist from \\"Street Fighter,\\" find themselves at the helm of a multinational corporation. The company, named \\"Satsui no Hado & Hakkyokuseiken Inc.\\"—fusing the essence of their respective fighting styles—specializes in advanced security solutions, martial arts equipment, and fitness products. The company's inception was as unusual as its leadership. A global tournament had been organized by unknown patrons, inviting fighters from all corners of the world to showcase their might. As fate would have it, the final match saw Geese facing Akuma. The battle was fierce and seemed everlasting, with both warriors matched in their relentless pursuit of victory. However, their duel was abruptly halted when the tournament grounds came under attack by a rogue organization. In the midst of confusion, the tournament was canceled, leaving no victor. In the aftermath, investigators discovered that the organization behind the attack sought to harness the combatants' power for developing advanced weaponry. Both Geese and Akuma, being at the pinnacle of human strength and skill, could not tolerate this perversion of martial arts. They decided to join forces to ensure no one could exploit the essence of their combat prowess. Thus, Satsui no Hado & Hakkyokuseiken Inc. was born, with the concept of creating products that enhanced individuals' capabilities without compromising their integrity. With Geese's acumen for business and underworld connections, and Akuma's focus on discipline and mastery, the company grew at an astonishing pace. Employees and business partners alike quickly realized that the Co-CEOs' contrasting styles created a balance that was unexpectedly complementary: - Geese's cutthroat business tactics were tempered by Akuma's impassive focus on product excellence. Clients were reeled in with Geese's charm and then retained by the uncompromising quality that Akuma demanded. - Akuma preferred minimal verbal communication and led by example. His presence in the company was felt rather than heard, as he fulfilled his duties silently, instilling fear and respect. Geese, on the other hand, was the face of the corporation, dealing with shareholders and the press with a silver tongue, occasionally reverting to intimidation when necessary. Their board meetings were intense. Geese would propose aggressive expansion plans, while Akuma would insist that the company keep its integrity, not selling out for mere profit. Their debates were battles of wits and philosophies, echoing the fierce energy of their physical confrontations, albeit ones that ended with strategic company decisions instead of knockouts. Geese implemented a strict hierarchy within the organization, with clear pathways of progression based on merit and loyalty. Meanwhile, Akuma spearheaded an internal dojo for employees, encouraging them to strive for self-improvement and to embody the company's ethos of strength and discipline. Corporate espionage and attempts to sabotage their operations were met with decisive and unmerciful retaliation. Competitors quickly learned that to cross Satsui no Hado & Hakkyokuseiken Inc. was to invite retribution of a nature that they could not withstand. This, however, drew the attention of authorities and moral watchdogs, who were wary of the company's rapid ascent and potential underworld affiliations. Despite external pressures, the company thrived. It launched products that were true to the spirit of martial arts while incorporating advanced technology. Smart-gi's embedded with sensors to track performance, a line of environmentally-friendly but exceptionally resilient training equipment, a biometrically-secured home security system named \\"Reppuken,\\" and a fitness program powered by augmented reality, simulating sparring sessions with digital projections of the Co-CEOs themselves. Yet, for all their success in the corporate realm, Akuma and Geese never forgot their roots as fighters. They maintained a tradition – an annual closed-doors exhibition match where they would test their strength and skills against one another.

Even this, however, can be unreliable as the individual may not be truthful. 2. **Use Age Verification Tools:** Some platforms and services require users to pass an age verification process, which may include providing a government-issued ID. 3. **Follow Platform Guidelines:** If you're using a specific platform for communication, ensure you follow their user guidelines and rules related to age verification and content-sharing policies. 4. **Restrict Content Sharing:** To mitigate risks, do not share adult content with anyone unless you're sure of their age and it's within a legally permissible context. The best practice is not to share such content unless it's through a regulated and secure service that is designed for that purpose and has strict age verification measures in place. 5. **Report Suspicions:** If you suspect someone is underage, do not interact in any sort of adult conversation or content sharing. Instead, report your concerns to the platform or service administrators. Protecting minors from adult content is a serious matter. If you're unsure, err on the side of caution and do not share any potentially explicit content. Remember that adult content should only be shared within legal and consensual contexts, and it's your responsibility to ensure that all parties are of legal age."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

First, let's examine VCLT Article 4 itself. This article clarifies that the provisions of the Convention do not affect the application of any other rules of international law to which treaties would be subject independently of the Convention. In simpler terms, it means that the rules laid down in the VCLT should not interfere with the application of any existing international legal norms that would be relevant to treaties even if the VCLT did not exist. When considering the connection between this phrase and VCLT Article 38, it is noteworthy that Article 38 defines the sources of international law. It sets out different types of materials that can be considered as sources of international law, including treaties, custom, general principles, and judicial decisions. The phrase in Article 4 suggests that the rules set forth in the VCLT should not undermine or supersede the general principles and customary rules recognized under Article 38 of the VCLT as part of international law. This is to ensure that the VCLT itself does not replace or contradict well-established principles of international law that would apply regardless of the existence of the Convention. In summary, the phrase in Article 4 of the VCLT emphasizes that while the Convention provides a comprehensive framework for treaty law, it does not override or disregard other rules and principles of international law. The connection between this phrase and Article 38 lies in the harmonization of the VCLT's provisions with the broader sources of international law mentioned in Article 38."},{"prompt":"Which Latin maxims are traditionally used to describe the following relations among norms mentioned in the ILC’s Conclusions on the Fragmentation of International Law (2006), namely ‘[n]orms at higher and lower hierarchical levels, […] [involving] greater or lesser generality and specificity and [whose] validity may date back to earlier or later moments in time’?

Lex Superior Derogat Legi Inferiori: This maxim signifies that a higher-ranking norm prevails over a lower-ranking norm in case of conflict. It highlights the hierarchical structure of norms within legal systems, such as national or international law, where norms at higher levels, such as constitutional provisions or treaties, take precedence over norms at lower levels, such as domestic legislation or subsidiary regulations. In the context of the ILC's Conclusions on the Fragmentation of International Law (2006), this maxim indicates that when conflicts arise between norms at different hierarchical levels, the norm at the higher level will prevail over a norm at the lower level. Regarding missing classifications of norms, it is important to consider the principle of jus cogens and customary international law: 2. Jus Cogens: This Latin term refers to a peremptory norm of general international law from which no derogation is permitted. Jus cogens norms are considered to have superior authority compared to other norms and cannot be overridden by contrary agreements or treaties. These norms are considered fundamental and essential principles of international law, such as prohibitions on genocide, torture, or piracy. 3. Customary International Law: Customary international law refers to the practice of states followed out of a sense of legal obligation. It consists of unwritten rules that emerge from consistent state practice, accompanied by a belief in their legal obligation (opinio juris). Customary international law holds a position alongside treaty law in the hierarchy of international norms. While the ILC's Conclusions on the Fragmentation of International Law focus on norms at different hierarchical levels, there are additional important classifications of norms within the international legal system. These include the recognition of general principles of law, jus cogens norms, and customary international law. The ILC's Provisional Draft Conclusions re General principles of law (2023) and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) 1969 also play a crucial role in clarifying the role and importance of these classifications within the international legal framework."},{"prompt":"Why does the ILC in its Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties (2011) states that the effect of legal reservations implies that ‘the author of that reservation has neither rights nor obligations under those provisions in its relations with the other parties with regard to which the reservation is established’? In your analysis, please consider whether this effect of reservations alters the character of the treaty in respect to which a reservation is established as a source of law.","completion":"The International Law Commission's (ILC) assertion in its Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties (2011) that the effect of legal reservations means the author of the reservation has neither rights nor obligations under the provisions to which the reservation applies is rooted in the principle of reciprocity and consent in treaty law. The purpose of a reservation is for a state to exclude or modify the legal effect of certain provisions of a treaty from applying to itself. By making a reservation, a state establishes a specific condition or limitation regarding its obligations under the treaty. However, the ILC's statement clarifies that the state making the reservation is then not bound by the provisions of the treaty to which the reservation applies in its relations with other parties who have not accepted or are not bound by the reservation. This approach reflects the principle of reciprocity in treaty law, which means that the rights and obligations of states under a treaty are generally mutual. Reservations, therefore, modify the reciprocal rights and obligations between states and prevent the reserving state from benefiting or being subject to the treaty provisions in relation to other parties who have not accepted the reservation. In terms of altering the character of the treaty as a source of law, it is important to note that reservations do not change the legal nature of the treaty itself. The treaty remains a valid and binding source of law for those parties who have not entered reservations or accepted reservations made by others. The effect of a reservation is limited to the specific state making the reservation and does not affect the general legal obligations and rights of other parties under the treaty. While reservations may alter the applicability of specific provisions of a treaty in certain instances, they do not fundamentally change the nature of the treaty as a source of law. The treaty continues to exist as a binding legal instrument for all parties who have not made reservations or accepted reservations by others."},{"prompt":"Which Latin maxims are traditionally used to describe the following relations among norms mentioned in the ILC’s Conclusions on the Fragmentation of International Law (2006), namely ‘[n]orms at higher and lower hierarchical levels, […] [involving] greater or lesser generality and specificity and [whose] validity may date back to earlier or later moments in time’?

They provide guidance to courts and tribunals in the absence of specific treaty or customary law provisions.

Una foto può essere un potente strumento per comunicare, per condividere un ricordo o per esprimere un'emozione. Ci permette di fermare il tempo e di conservare per sempre un istante che altrimenti andrebbe perso. Inserire una foto in un contesto, come ad esempio un album o un articolo, può dare ancora più valore e significato all'immagine. Può aggiungere un livello di profondità e arricchire la storia che si vuole raccontare. Quando si sceglie la foto da inserire, è importante considerare il messaggio che si vuole comunicare e l'effetto che si vuole ottenere. Una foto luminosa e colorata può trasmettere allegria e vitalità, mentre una foto in bianco e nero può evocare un senso di nostalgia o mistero. Scegliere la posizione giusta per inserire la foto può fare la differenza. Può essere collocata in modo centrale, per attirare l'attenzione e diventare il fulcro dell'intero contesto, oppure può essere inserita in un angolo per creare un effetto di prospettiva o di focalizzazione. Cura dei dettagli come la cornice o l'effetto di ombra possono ancora più valorizzare la foto. Una cornice elaborata può conferire un tocco di eleganza e raffinatezza, mentre un'ombra morbida può dare profondità e tridimensionalità all'immagine. Inserire una foto richiede cura e attenzione, ma il risultato finale può essere gratificante. Quella foto può diventare un pezzo importante del puzzle, un modo per esprimere noi stessi e trasmettere un messaggio senza dover pronunciare una sola parola. Quindi, prendete una foto che vi emoziona, che vi fa sorridere o vi fa rivivere un momento speciale, e inseritela dove ritenete sia più appropriato. Vedrete come quella foto prenderà vita e racconterà la sua storia in maniera unica e personale."},{"prompt":"testo presentazione band rock blues","completion":"Ci presentiamo, siamo una band rock blues pronta a farvi vibrare con il nostro suono potente e le nostre intense performance dal vivo.

Jest to jeden, niepodzielny Bóg, który stwarza świat z niczego swoją potęgą i mądrością. W tej koncepcji Bóg ma władzę nad naturą i nad ludźmi, którzy są stworzeni na Jego obraz i podobieństwo. Jest On również źródłem wszelkiego dobra, miłości i życia, oraz odpowiedzialny za utrzymanie i rządzenie światem. W przeciwieństwie do tego, starożytni Grecy mieli wiarę w wielu bogów, którzy byli nie tylko wszechmocni, ale także podobni do ludzi, z ich wadami, konfliktami i emocjami. Bogowie greccy mieli różnorodne role i dziedziny wpływu, na przykład Zeus był królem bogów i piorunów, Posejdon panował nad morzami, Atena była boginią mądrości i sztuki, itd. Greckie bogi byli również znani ze swoich interakcji i związków z ludźmi, często ingerując w ich sprawy i decyzje. Byli także czczeni poprzez ofiary i rytuały. Wiara ta była bliższa rzeczywistości człowieka, pełnej konfliktów, namiętności i złożoności. W porównaniu do koncepcji boga wyłaniającej się z opowieści o stworzeniu świata, wyobrażenia starożytnych Greków na temat ich bogów były bardziej pluralistyczne i uwzględniały różnorodność charakterów, a także zaangażowanie bogów w sprawy ludzi.

In a real-world MusicXML file, one would expect more detailed information, including all the notes of the scale, possibly multiple measures, staves, and parts, as well as various musical notations and dynamics.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to generate actual music compositions or large MusicXML files on-demand, as it would require a level of creativity and subjective decision-making that is challenging for AI, not to mention the space limitations for responses here. However, I can provide you with a very basic template of MusicXML that shows how you might start an orchestral score for strings (Violin I, Violin II, Viola, Cello, and Double Bass). This example won't sound like much; it's just a starting point for the structure.

For a complete orchestral piece, you would generally compose the piece using music composition software or manually write out the parts and then export it to the MusicXML format (.xml or .mxl, which is a compressed version of .xml). If you're interested in writing actual music, I highly recommend using music composition software, as it will handle the intricacies of music notation as well as outputting in MusicXML format.

Resistance to change: Implementing total quality management requires a shift in organizational culture, which can be met with resistance from employees who are accustomed to traditional ways of working. Overcoming this resistance and obtaining buy-in from all organizational levels can be a major challenge. 2. Lack of employee engagement: Total quality management relies heavily on the active involvement and commitment of all employees. However, engaging employees and fostering a sense of ownership and accountability can be difficult, especially if there is a lack of communication and transparency within the organization. 3. Inconsistent implementation: Ensuring consistent implementation of quality management practices across all departments and locations can be challenging. Different interpretations and execution of quality standards can lead to variations in product or service quality. 4. Continuous improvement: Total quality management is based on the principle of continuous improvement, which requires a proactive approach to identifying and resolving issues. However, many organizations struggle to maintain the momentum of improvement initiatives and often fall into a state of complacency. 5. Lack of resources: Implementing total quality management requires a significant investment of time, money, and resources. Organizations may struggle with allocating the necessary resources, such as training, technology, and dedicated personnel, to support quality management efforts. 6. Measuring and evaluating quality: Establishing effective metrics and measuring quality performance can be challenging. Identifying the appropriate indicators and collecting reliable data to assess quality can be complex, especially in service-oriented industries where quality is subjective. 7. Supplier management: Total quality management extends beyond internal processes to include suppliers and partners. Managing and monitoring the quality of inputs and ensuring consistency and reliability from external sources can be a challenge, especially when there are multiple suppliers involved. 8. Sustaining the focus on quality: Total quality management requires ongoing commitment and focus on quality improvement. Organizations may face challenges in sustaining the momentum, especially when other priorities or crises arise that divert attention away from quality management efforts. 9. Cultural compatibility: Total quality management may face challenges in organizations with deeply entrenched hierarchical or authoritarian cultures, where the principles of employee empowerment and involvement might not be readily accepted or implemented. 10. Resistance from top management: Without strong support and commitment from top management, total quality management initiatives are likely to face significant challenges. Overcoming resistance and securing consistent leadership support is crucial for the successful implementation of quality management practices."},{"prompt":"Literature review on depression and psychotherapy a mong female youth and the background .","completion":"Title: Literature Review on Depression and Psychotherapy Among Female Youth: An Overview of Background and Evidence-based Interventions Introduction: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder affecting individuals of all ages, with substantial consequences for personal, academic, and social functioning. Among various demographic groups, female youth, including adolescents and young adults, are particularly vulnerable to the onset and chronicity of depression. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the background and current evidence-based psychotherapy interventions for depression among female youth. Background: 1. Depression Prevalence in Female Youth: Research indicates that female youth exhibit higher rates of depression compared to their male counterparts. Factors such as hormonal changes, psychosocial stressors, body image concerns, and gender-based discrimination contribute to this disparity. 2. Impact of Depression on Female Youth: Depression among female youth significantly impairs academic performance, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, and overall quality of life. Additionally, depression in this population commonly co-occurs with self-harm, eating disorders, and other mental health issues. 3. Factors Influencing Treatment-seeking: Several barriers inhibit female youth from seeking timely help, including stigma, lack of awareness, societal expectations, and difficulty accessing mental health services. Understanding these factors is crucial for designing effective interventions. Evidence-based Interventions: 1. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT is widely recognized as an effective psychotherapy intervention for depression among female youth. This approach focuses on identifying and modifying negative thought patterns, improving problem-solving skills, and developing coping strategies to enhance emotional well-being. 2. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT): IPT is another evidence-based intervention that targets impaired interpersonal relationships and social functioning. By addressing difficulties in communication, conflict resolution, and social support, IPT helps alleviate depressive symptoms in female youth. 3. Mindfulness-based Interventions: Mindfulness-based therapies, such as Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), have gained significant attention in recent years. These interventions emphasize present-moment awareness, acceptance, and non-judgmental thinking, proving effective in reducing depression among female youth. 4. Family-based Therapy: Recognizing the significance of familial relationships, family-based interventions can be instrumental in treating depression among female youth. By improving family communication, problem-solving, and support mechanisms, these interventions enhance overall well-being of the young individual. Conclusion: Depression among female youth is a critical mental health concern, necessitating effective interventions. This literature review has provided an overview of the background and evidence-based psychotherapy interventions for depression among female youth. By understanding the unique experiences and needs of this population, mental health professionals can tailor interventions to effectively address depression and enhance the well-being of female youth."},{"prompt":"Who in your community is responsible for leading adaptation and mitigation to climate change?","completion":"In communities, various stakeholders collaborate to lead adaptation and mitigation efforts to address climate change. These stakeholders may include: 1. Local government: Local government bodies, such as city councils or municipal authorities, often take a leading role in climate change adaptation and mitigation. They formulate policies, regulations, and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy, develop resilient infrastructure, and ensure climate resilience in the community. 2. Environmental and Climate Change Departments: Within local governments, dedicated departments or agencies might be responsible for climate change-related initiatives. These departments work to assess climate risks, develop action plans, support community education, and coordinate climate-related projects and programs. 3. Non-Profit Organizations: Non-profit organizations, particularly those focused on environmental conservation and sustainability, play an essential role in leading climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. They often work alongside local government bodies to raise awareness, implement community projects, drive sustainability campaigns, and advocate for climate-friendly policies. 4. Community-Based Organizations: Grassroots community organizations can be influential in leading adaptation and mitigation efforts. These organizations mobilize local residents, facilitate community engagement, and implement local projects that contribute to climate resilience, such as community gardens, tree planting initiatives, and energy-saving programs. 5. Business and Industry: Private businesses and industries also have a responsibility to lead climate change adaptation and mitigation. Sustainable businesses may invest in renewable energy systems, reduce emissions through improved production processes, and implement greener supply chains. They can also pioneer innovative technologies and contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy. 6. Educational Institutions: Schools, colleges, and universities play a crucial role in leading climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts through education, research, and collaboration. They educate students about climate change, conduct research on sustainable practices, and develop partnerships with other stakeholders to implement climate-related initiatives. 7.

Угловой коэффициент k определяется как отношение изменения координаты y к изменению координаты x при переходе от одной точки к другой: k = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) где (x1, y1) и (x2, y2) — координаты двух разных точек на прямой. Для точек A(1, 2) и B(-1, 3): k = (2 - 3) / (1 - (-1)) = (-1) / (1 + 1) = -1 / 2 Теперь, когда у нас есть угловой коэффициент, подставим координаты одной из точек, например A(1;2), в уравнение y = kx + b, чтобы найти b: 2 = (-1/2) * 1 + b b = 2 + 1/2 b = 2.5 Таким образом, уравнение прямой вида y = kx + b примет вид: y = -1/2 * x + 2.5 Теперь найдем нормальный вектор прямой. Нормальный вектор прямой — это вектор, перпендикулярный данной прямой. В нашем случае, так как прямая имеет угловой коэффициент k = -1/2, нормальный вектор можно найти как вектор, координаты которого равны коэффициентам при x и y в уравнении прямой, но с изменением координат местами и одной из координат с противоположным знаком. В нашем случае, так как коэффициент при x равен -1/2, и коэффициент при y равен 1 (так как перед y ничего не стоит в уравнении y = -1/2 * x + 2.5, и это означает, что коэффициент равен 1), нормальный вектор будет иметь координаты: N = (1, 1/2) Обратите внимание, что нормальный вектор указывает в положительную сторону оси y и в положительную сторону оси x (так как мы меняем знак у координаты, соответствующей x)."},{"prompt":"write me a clause for resolutation paper our topic is United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development (UNCSTD): Ethical considerations in artificial intelligence: Establishing guidelines for responsible AI usage and my country is belarus","completion":"Clause: The delegation of Belarus acknowledges the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in various aspects of human life, and recognizes the significance of ethical considerations in developing and deploying AI technologies.

Please, write an essay about similarities and differences of attention and working memory and describe how they work together in cognitive processing. Write an essay with a word limit of 600 words in scientific style with citations and references.","completion":"Title: The Interplay of Attention and Working Memory in Cognitive Processing Introduction: Cognitive psychology explores the intricate workings of human cognition, encompassing functions such as attention and working memory. Though often discussed separately, attention and working memory share both similarities and differences, ultimately working in tandem to support cognitive processing. This essay will delve into the similarities and differences between attention and working memory before highlighting their collaborative role in cognitive processing. Similarities between Attention and Working Memory: Attention and working memory are closely intertwined cognitive processes that share several underlying similarities. Firstly, both attention and working memory involve the selection and maintenance of relevant information while disregarding irrelevant or distracting stimuli (Baddeley, 1992). Secondly, both processes are limited in capacity, highlighting the need for the allocation and management of cognitive resources (Postle, 2006). Lastly, attention and working memory are crucial for goal-directed behavior, with both facilitating the integration of incoming sensory information with existing knowledge (Cowan, 2001). Differences between Attention and Working Memory: While attention and working memory exhibit overlapping features, they also differ in terms of their specific characteristics and functions. Attention refers to the process of selectively attending to relevant stimuli while inhibiting or ignoring irrelevant information (Posner, 1994). It serves as a filter for incoming sensory information, allowing only the most pertinent information to be processed further (Carrasco, 2011). In contrast, working memory refers to a limited capacity system that temporarily maintains and manipulates information for ongoing cognitive tasks (Baddeley, 1986). It involves the active maintenance of representations and the executive control necessary for cognitive operations. Working Memory and Attention: A Collaborative Relationship: Working memory and attention mutually influence and enhance one another, creating an interdependent relationship that facilitates cognitive processing. This collaboration can be observed through two key mechanisms: attention-based selection and the storage and manipulation of information. 1. Attention-Based Selection: Attention plays a crucial role in the initial encoding and subsequent updating of working memory (Awh & Jonides, 2001). For instance, attentional processes are necessary for selectively attending to relevant stimuli, which then enter working memory for further processing (Cowan, 1988). This selection process can enhance the encoding and subsequent retention of information in working memory (Luck & Vogel, 1997). Moreover, the allocation of attention to specific items in working memory allows for the prioritization of relevant information, aiding cognitive processing and decision-making (Smith & Levin, 1996). 2. Storage and Manipulation of Information: Working memory aids attentional processes by providing the storage capacity necessary for maintaining relevant information. This enables attentional resources to be directed towards the completion of ongoing cognitive tasks without information loss or interference. Additionally, working memory is crucial for manipulating and transforming information, facilitating higher-order cognitive functions such as problem solving and decision making (Oberauer, 2002). Attention contributes to this process by selectively directing cognitive resources towards the relevant components of working memory, optimizing the efficiency of manipulation (Vogel et al., 2005). Conclusion: In conclusion, attention and working memory are two interdependent cognitive processes that work synergistically to support optimal cognitive functioning. While attention selectively filters incoming stimuli, working memory actively stores and manipulates relevant information for ongoing tasks. They share similarities in terms of their selective nature, limited capacity, and goal-oriented functions. However, attention is primarily concerned with the initial filtering process, whereas working memory focuses on the active maintenance and manipulation of information. Their interplay is crucial for cognitive processing, as attention helps in the selection and encoding of relevant information into working memory, whereas working memory enhances attentional processes by providing a storage platform for relevant information. Acknowledging the intricate relationship between attention and working memory provides a deeper understanding of cognitive processes, aiding future research and clinical interventions in cognitive psychology.

Introduction: Attention and short-term memory are essential cognitive processes that exhibit capacity limitations. While both attention and short-term memory are known to have finite capacities, it remains unclear whether their limitations stem from the same source or if they are independent constraints. This essay aims to delve into the capacity limitations of attention and short-term memory, exploring possible links between them and discussing current research evidence. Capacity Limitations of Attention: Attentional capacity refers to the limited amount of information that an individual can process or attend to at a given time (Navon & Gopher, 1979). Researchers have proposed different theoretical accounts to explain the capacity limitations of attention, one of which is the \\"perceptual load theory\\" (Lavie, 1995). According to this theory, attentional capacity is influenced by the amount of perceptual information in the environment. High perceptual load tasks that require the processing of a large amount of information may exhaust attentional resources, making it difficult to process additional stimuli. On the other hand, low perceptual load tasks leave spare capacity, allowing for more efficient allocation of attention to additional stimuli. Capacity Limitations of Short-Term Memory: Short-term memory, often referred to as working memory, is a limited capacity system responsible for temporarily storing and manipulating information. Research suggests that the capacity of short-term memory is limited to around seven, plus or minus two, chunks of information (Miller, 1956). However, recent studies have challenged this \\"magical number\\" and argue that the capacity of short-term memory is better described in terms of the amount of information that can be actively maintained, rather than the number of discrete items (Cowan, 2001). This limited capacity is likely influenced by factors such as the complexity of the information being stored and the cognitive load placed on working memory. Relationship between Attention and Short-Term Memory Capacity: The relationship between attention and short-term memory capacity remains a topic of investigation. Some theorists propose that attentional resources determine the capacity limitations of short-term memory, suggesting that attentional capacity sets the upper limit on the amount of information that can be actively stored and manipulated (Cowan, 2005). In this view, attention acts as a gatekeeper, directing resources to relevant stimuli for encoding into working memory and facilitating the maintenance of that information. Others argue that attention and short-term memory have independent limitations. While attention filters incoming information, selectively allowing relevant stimuli to enter working memory, the capacity of working memory is determined by the ability to retain and manipulate the selected information (Oberauer, 2002). According to this view, attention and short-term memory have separate capacity limits, and the limitations of each system are governed by different cognitive processes. Current research supports the notion that attention and short-term memory may have partially independent limitations but also interact in complex ways. Studies have shown that increasing attentional load reduces the available capacity for storing information in working memory (Fukuda & Vogel, 2011). Additionally, attentional control processes play a role in coordinating the allocation of working memory resources, enabling efficient utilization of limited capacity (Vogel et al., 2005). Conclusion: Attention and short-term memory are fundamental cognitive processes that exhibit capacity limitations. While the specific nature of these limitations is still a subject of investigation, evidence suggests that attention and short-term memory have partially independent capacities. Attentional resources play a role in determining the amount of information that can enter working memory, while the capacity of working memory is influenced by the ability to actively maintain and manipulate the selected information. Nonetheless, attention and working memory interact in complex ways, with attentional control processes influencing the allocation and efficiency of working memory resources. Further research examining the relationship between attention and short-term memory capacities is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between these cognitive processes. Investigating the specific mechanisms that underlie their limitations, such as perceptual load and cognitive load, will provide crucial insights into the capacity constraints of attention and short-term memory, further advancing our knowledge of cognitive processing.

ABSTRACT Background Familial hypercholesterolemia is a prevalent genetic disorder with global implications for severe cardiovascular diseases. As the scrutiny on evaluating its economic impact intensifies, an imperative arises for a worldwide synthesis of economic evidence related to familial hypercholesterolemia screening. This study aims to globally examine economic assessments of familial hypercholesterolemia, synthesize evidence, and present economic insights into the impact of familial hypercholesterolemia screening on population equity. Methods A systematic literature review targeted economic evaluations of familial hypercholesterolemia screening. The quality appraisal of literature was guided by the quality of health economic studies instrument and consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards 2022. Meta-analysis techniques were applied to integrate findings from various studies, focusing on the total cost-effectiveness and total net health benefit associated with both cascade and universal screening programs for familial hypercholesterolemia. An aggregate distributional cost-effectiveness analysis was employed to determine the potential impact of screening programs on health equity across populations. Results The study results reveal significant differences in the economic evaluations of familial hypercholesterolemia across different countries, and we provide detailed descriptions of unique characteristics. The combined results of cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that 90% of screening for familial hypercholesterolemia is cost-effective. Meta-analysis synthesized the economic impacts of seven sets of cascade and universal screening across diverse health outcomes. Aggregate distributional cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the difference was positive across all six studies, indicating that familial hypercholesterolemia screening strategy has the potential to mitigate health inequalities. Conclusion This study provides a global perspective on familial hypercholesterolemia economic evaluation. Despite international variations, findings suggest that, in the majority of cases, familial hypercholesterolemia screening is cost-effective, improving health equity and overall population health. The study offers a positive outlook for future health decisions.","completion":"ABSTRACT Background: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a commonly occurring genetic disorder that significantly contributes to cardiovascular disease risks on a global scale. Economic evaluations of FH screening have increasingly become focal due to the vital insights they provide into the disorder's financial implications. This study consolidates global economic evidence on FH screening, seeking to offer an encompassing understanding of its economic effects and the implications for health equity among populations. Methods: A comprehensive, systematic literature review was conducted to identify economic evaluations of FH screening programs. The methodological quality of the included studies was appraised via established instruments, namely the Quality of Health Economic Studies tool and the updated Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022. Meta-analytical methods were utilized to amalgamate individual study outcomes, keying in on the aggregate cost-effectiveness and net health benefits of cascade and universal FH screening strategies. Furthermore, we adopted distributive cost-effectiveness analysis to gauge the impact of such programs on health equity. Results: Significant heterogeneity was observed in the economic evaluations of FH screening across various national contexts, with each revealing characteristic nuances. The meta-analysis divulged that a vast majority, approximately 90%, of screening interventions were deemed cost-effective. We synthesized economic data from seven varied sets of cascade and universal screening models, reflecting disparate health outcomes. Notably, our distributive cost-effectiveness analysis underscored a uniformly positive impact on health equity, as gleaned from all six studies included in this facet of evaluation. Conclusion: This study extends a panoramic view on the economic assessment of FH screening globally. While international disparities persist, our findings consistently indicate that FH screening is largely cost-effective, with the added benefit of diminishing health disparities and enhancing the health of populations at large. This compendium of evidence should serve as an optimistic predication for upcoming health policy-making and resource allocation.

When requests are made to these servers, the custom hosts file redirects them to a non-routable address (such as 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1), effectively blocking the ad before it reaches your browser. Creating or maintaining such a hosts file by yourself can be very time-consuming, as the landscape of ad servers changes frequently. However, there are community-maintained hosts files available that are designed to block ads, trackers, malware, and more. One popular choice is Steven Black's hosts file compilation which can be found on GitHub. This project amalgamates several reputable hosts files and merges them into a single file that you can use on your Windows device. Here's how to use Steven Black's hosts file on your Windows computer: 1. Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts 2. Click on the green \\"Code\\" button, then \\"Download ZIP\\" or select a specific variant you need under the \\"releases\\" section. 3. Extract the hosts file from the ZIP archive. 4. Open the directory \`C:WindowsSystem32driversetc\` as an administrator. This is where the existing hosts file for your Windows system is located. 5. Create a backup of your current hosts file by renaming it (e.g., to hosts.old). 6. Copy the downloaded hosts file into the \`etc\` directory. 7. If you're prompted to provide administrator permission to move the file, do so. After you have replaced the hosts file, you may need to flush the DNS cache for the changes to take effect immediately. You can do this by running the following command in the Command Prompt as an administrator: \`\`\`cmd ipconfig /flushdns \`\`\` Please note that because this method blocks domains on the DNS level, it will not stop all kinds of ads, specifically those served from the same domain as legitimate content. For more granular control over ad blocking, you may consider using browser extensions like uBlock Origin or a network-wide solution like Pi-hole."},{"prompt":"Paraphrase (I have completed review and comments on it.

A coil of 268 turns and 5.2-1) resistance is wound around the doughnut and connected to a 45-V battery. Determine (a) the core flux; (b) repeat (a), assuming the half-rings are separated 0.12 cm at each end (assume no fringing), and the reluctance of the half-rings does not change; (c) the magnetic drop across each air gap in (b).","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for magnetic flux: Flux = (magnetomotive force) / (reluctance) where the magnetomotive force is given by: MMF = (number of turns) * (current) (a) To find the core flux, we need to find the total reluctance of the circuit. The total reluctance can be found by adding the reluctances of the two halves of the doughnut. Therefore, the total reluctance is: Reluctance_total = Reluctance1 + Reluctance2 Reluctance1 = 650 A-t/Wb Reluctance2 = 244 A-t/Wb Reluctance_total = 650 A-t/Wb + 244 A-t/Wb Reluctance_total = 894 A-t/Wb Now, we can find the flux by dividing the magnetomotive force by the total reluctance: Flux = MMF / Reluctance_total MMF = (number of turns) * (current) = 268 * 5.2 A Flux = (268 * 5.2 A) / (894 A-t/Wb) (b) To find the core flux when the half-rings are separated at each end, we have to take into account the additional reluctance introduced by the air gaps. The additional reluctance is given by: Reluctance_gap = (length of gap) / (permeability of free space) * (cross-sectional area of the gap) Length of gap = 0.12 cm = 0.0012 m Permeability of free space = 4π * 10^-7 T-m/A Cross-sectional area of the gap = (cross-sectional area of the core) Reluctance_gap = (0.0012 m) / (4π * 10^-7 T-m/A) * (0.14 m^2) Now we can find the total reluctances, including the reluctances of the gaps: Reluctance_total = Reluctance_core + 2 * Reluctance_gap Reluctance_core = Reluctance1 + Reluctance2 = 650 A-t/Wb + 244 A-t/Wb Reluctance_total = (650 A-t/Wb + 244 A-t/Wb) + 2 * Reluctance_gap Flux = MMF / Reluctance_total (c) The magnetic drop across each air gap is equal to the product of the flux in one air gap and the reluctance of that air gap: Magnetic drop = Flux * Reluctance_gap"},{"prompt":"write me a VBA code for a PowerPoint presentation for debt collection i need ten slides fill the content on your own.","completion":"Sure, Here's a VBA code that generates ten slides with content related to debt collection: \`\`\`vb Sub GenerateDebtCollectionPresentation() Dim pptApp As PowerPoint.Application Dim pptPres As PowerPoint.Presentation Dim pptSlide As PowerPoint.slide ' Create a new PowerPoint application Set pptApp = New PowerPoint.Application pptApp.Visible = True ' Create a new presentation Set pptPres = pptApp.Presentations.Add ' Create ten slides with content For i = 1 To 10 ' Add a new slide Set pptSlide = pptPres.Slides.Add(i, ppLayoutTitleOnly) ' Set the slide title pptSlide.Shapes.Title.TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Debt Collection Slide \\" & i ' Add content to the slide Select Case i Case 1 ' Slide 1 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Introduction to Debt Collection\\" Case 2 ' Slide 2 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Importance of Effective Debt Collection Strategies\\" Case 3 ' Slide 3 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Key Principles of Debt Collection\\" Case 4 ' Slide 4 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Steps to Efficiently Collect Debt\\" Case 5 ' Slide 5 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Common Challenges in Debt Collection\\" Case 6 ' Slide 6 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Legal and Ethical Considerations\\" Case 7 ' Slide 7 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Effective Communication Techniques\\" Case 8 ' Slide 8 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Negotiation Strategies in Debt Collection\\" Case 9 ' Slide 9 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Utilizing Technology for Debt Collection\\" Case 10 ' Slide 10 content pptSlide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 200).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = \\"Conclusion\\" End Select Next i ' Cleanup Set pptSlide = Nothing Set pptPres = Nothing Set pptApp = Nothing MsgBox \\"Debt Collection presentation created successfully!\\", vbInformation End Sub \`\`\` Make sure to add the necessary references to Microsoft PowerPoint Object Library in the VBA Editor before running this code.

Империя - это крупное государственное образование, часто возникающее путем завоевания и объединения различных народов под единым правлением. Однако, несмотря на временные периоды расцвета и процветания некоторых империй, их существование кажется неприемлемым по многим причинам. **Источники Неприемлемости:** 1. **Потеря Суверенитета и Самоопределения.** Имперские стремления приводят к подавлению культурной и политической самобытности завоеванных народов. Это не просто геополитическая экспансия, это утрата идентичности и исторической наследственности для покоряемых сообществ. 2. **Репрессии и Насилие.** Используя свою военную мощь, империи часто прибегают к репрессивным мерам, чтобы поддерживать порядок и контроль над разнообразными населенными пунктами. Такое насилие нередко приводит к массовым страданиям и нарушениям прав человека. 3. **Экономическая Эксплуатация.** Завоеванные территории обычно используются в интересах метрополии, что ведет к истощению местных ресурсов, эксплуатации труда и ослаблению местной экономики. 4. **Социальные разрывы и Напряженность.** Империализм порождает социальные напряжения между завоевателями и подчиненными, прививая иерархические и расовые предрассудки, которые могут длиться веками. 5. **Ослабление Глобальной Стабильности.** Амбиции империй обычно ведут к международным конфликтам и войнам, так как они сталкиваются с конкурентами за контроль над территориями и ресурсами. **Исторические Уроки и Современные Реалии:** Империи, такие как Римская, Османская, Британская и многие другие, все предпринимали попытки построить вечные царства, но каждая, в конце концов, сталкивалась с неизбежным закатом. Эти исторические примеры демонстрируют, что несмотря на кратковременные выгоды, долгосрочные последствия имперских экспедиций оказываются пагубными для всех сторон. В современном мире мы сталкиваемся с необходимостью переосмысления концепции империй. В эпоху глобализации и взаимозависимости необходимо уважать принципы суверенитета государств и права народов на самоопределение. Уроки прошлого говорят нам о том, что идея господства одного народа или государства над другими не только морально устарела, но и является крайне неэффективной в плане достижения устойчивого мира и безопасности. **Заключение:** Неприемлемость империй не является пустым риторическим заявлением, а, скорее, осознанным выбором в пользу более справедливого и сбалансированного мироустройства. Когда великие державы ведут себя ответственно, уважая международное право и человеческое достоинство, мы приближаемся к миру, где прогресс и благосостояние становятся достижимыми для всех народов и стран, а не только для немногих избранных. Таким образом, взгляд в прошлое может послужить критическим инструментом для формирования будущего, в котором идея империй, как системы управления, наконец останется лишь уроком истории."},{"prompt":"Resumen del polimerro en 265 palabras","completion":"El polímero es una sustancia química que se caracteriza por estar compuesta por moléculas largas y repetitivas llamadas monómeros. Estos monómeros se unen a través de enlaces químicos para formar cadenas que conforman la estructura del polímero. Existen diferentes tipos de polímeros, que se clasifican según su origen y propiedades. Los polímeros naturales se encuentran en la naturaleza, como por ejemplo, el ADN, el caucho y la celulosa. Por otro lado, los polímeros sintéticos son aquellos que se fabrican artificialmente a través de procesos químicos. Algunos ejemplos de polímeros sintéticos son el plástico, el nylon y el poliéster. El polímero tiene muchas aplicaciones en diferentes industrias debido a sus propiedades. Por ejemplo, los plásticos se utilizan en la fabricación de envases, electrodomésticos, vehículos, materiales de construcción y muchos otros productos. Esto se debe a que los polímeros son livianos, resistentes, flexibles y pueden ser moldeados en diferentes formas y tamaños. Los polímeros también son utilizados en la industria textil para la fabricación de telas y ropa. El nylon y el poliéster son dos ejemplos comunes de polímeros utilizados en la fabricación de fibras sintéticas. Estas fibras son resistentes, duraderas y fáciles de cuidar, lo que las hace ideales para la confección de prendas de vestir. En el campo de la medicina, los polímeros también juegan un papel importante. Por ejemplo, los materiales de sutura utilizados en cirugías son polímeros biodegradables que se disuelven con el tiempo. Además, los polímeros se utilizan en la fabricación de prótesis y dispositivos médicos, como implantes dentales, lentes de contacto y catéteres. En resumen, el polímero es una sustancia química compuesta por moléculas repetitivas llamadas monómeros.

Вместо использования циклов с numpy операциями, используйте векторизованные операции, так как они выполняются на C уровне и обеспечивают более быструю обработку данных. 2. Вместо выполнения итераций в цикле по случайным образцам, можно использовать метод \\"k-средних\\" для кластеризации потенциальных точек. Это позволит найти наиболее важные точки на изображении быстрее и точнее. 3. Если размер изображения достаточно большой, можно использовать многопоточность для распараллеливания вычислений. В numpy есть функции для распараллеливания вычислений, например, \`numpy.vectorize\` и \`numpy.frompyfunc\`. 4. Введение техник предварительной обработки изображений, таких как размытие или применение фильтров, может улучшить производительность алгоритма, удалив шум и упростив изображение. 5. Если изображение имеет низкий уровень шума, можно уменьшить количество итераций, чтобы ускорить алгоритм. Это можно сделать путем установки меньших значений для переменных \`ITERATIONS_NUM_0_2\`, \`ITERATIONS_NUM_3_5\` и \`ITERATIONS_NUM_6\`.

Develop a logic model or theory of change: Create a visual representation of how the programme is expected to achieve its intended outcomes. This could involve developing a logic model or theory of change that outlines the inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts of the programme. This model will serve as a basis for identifying key indicators and data sources for the evaluation. 4. Define indicators and data sources: Determine the indicators that will be used to measure the progress and achievements of the programme. These indicators should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound). Identify the data sources that will provide the necessary information to measure these indicators, which could include programmatic data, surveys, interviews, and other relevant sources. 5. Develop an evaluation plan: Create a detailed plan for conducting the evaluation, including the evaluation methodology, data collection and analysis methods, timeline, and resource requirements. The plan should specify how the RBM approach will be integrated into the evaluation design, including the use of RBM terminology, logic models, and indicators. 6. Collect and analyze data: Implement the data collection methods outlined in the evaluation plan, ensuring that the data collected is in line with the RBM approach. Analyze the data using appropriate qualitative and quantitative techniques, and compare the findings against the defined criteria and indicators. 7. Draw conclusions and make recommendations: Based on the analysis of the data, draw conclusions about the programme's effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, sustainability, and impact. Generate recommendations for improving the programme based on these conclusions, ensuring that they align with the RBM principles and the overall goals of UNFPA. 8. Report and communicate the findings: Compile the evaluation findings, conclusions, and recommendations into a comprehensive report. Present the report to relevant stakeholders, including UNFPA staff, partners, and beneficiaries. Use appropriate communication strategies to disseminate the findings and ensure that they inform decision-making and future programme planning. Remember that RBM approaches are focused on results, so it is important to continuously adapt and adjust the evaluation design based on the evidence generated during the process."},{"prompt":"hazme las bibliografias del libro Step up to Medicine","completion":"Lamentablemente, como modelo de lenguaje basado en inteligencia artificial, no puedo realizar acciones prácticas en tiempo real, como escribir bibliografías completas.

Los siguientes son algunos de los valores que podrían estar alterados en pacientes con enfermedad de Crohn: 1. Proteína C reactiva (PCR): La PCR es un marcador de inflamación que puede estar elevado en pacientes con enfermedad de Crohn activa. 2. Velocidad de sedimentación globular (VSG): La VSG es otro indicador de inflamación y también puede estar elevada en la enfermedad de Crohn. 3. Hemoglobina y hematocrito: La enfermedad de Crohn puede provocar sangrado crónico en el tracto gastrointestinal, lo que puede llevar a la anemia. Los niveles de hemoglobina y hematocrito pueden estar disminuidos en pacientes con enfermedad activa. 4. Albúmina: La albúmina es una proteína producida por el hígado que refleja el estado nutricional y la función hepática. En la enfermedad de Crohn, los niveles de albúmina pueden estar disminuidos debido a la malabsorción y la inflamación intestinal. 5. Recuento de glóbulos blancos: El recuento de glóbulos blancos puede estar elevado en la enfermedad de Crohn debido al proceso inflamatorio. Estos son solo algunos de los valores que pueden estar alterados en la enfermedad de Crohn, pero la evaluación y el seguimiento de la enfermedad requerirán pruebas adicionales y la consulta con un profesional de la salud especializado."},{"prompt":"y los tiempos de coagulación?","completion":"En general, la enfermedad de Crohn no está directamente asociada con trastornos de coagulación. Sin embargo, en algunos casos, la enfermedad de Crohn puede estar relacionada con ciertos trastornos de coagulación, como la trombosis venosa profunda (TVP). Si hay una sospecha de que un paciente con enfermedad de Crohn pueda tener un trastorno de coagulación, se pueden realizar pruebas específicas para evaluar los tiempos de coagulación. Algunas de las pruebas comunes incluyen: 1. Tiempo de protrombina (PT): Esta prueba mide la actividad de los factores de coagulación dependientes de la vitamina K en la vía extrínseca de la coagulación. 2. Tiempo de tromboplastina parcial activado (TTPa): Esta prueba evalúa la función de los factores de coagulación dependientes del calcio en la vía intrínseca de la coagulación. 3. Tiempo de sangrado: Esta prueba mide el tiempo necesario para que la sangre coagule después de una lesión en la piel. Es una prueba general de la función plaquetaria y de la formación del coágulo.
