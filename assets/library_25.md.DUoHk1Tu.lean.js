Notez que l'analyse du pic de volume ici est simpliste et peut ne pas être parfaitement précise dans tous les cas. Il est possible que vous ayez besoin d'ajuster la façon dont l'analyse est réalisée en fonction de la piste audio spécifique et des exigences de votre application."},{"prompt":"Les pics de volume : comment sont-ils identifiés ?","completion":"Pour identifier les pics de volume dans un fichier audio, il faut analyser le signal audio en mesurant l'intensité du volume à chaque instant. Généralement, le volume peut être mesuré en utilisant une représentation numérique du signal audio, où le volume est souvent évalué en termes de l'amplitude des ondes sonores. Un pic de volume est un point où l'amplitude est significativement plus élevée que celle des moments environnants. Le volume d'un signal audio numérique peut être évalué de plusieurs façons, mais une méthode courante est de calculer le Root Mean Square (RMS) de l'amplitude des échantillons audio. Le RMS donne une mesure de la puissance moyenne de l'amplitude du signal, qui est souvent perçue comme le volume par l'oreille humaine. Voici une approche algorithmique simplifiée pour trouver les pics de volume : 1. Charger la piste audio dans un format numérique tel qu'un tableau de données. Si l'audio est stéréo, vous pouvez d'abord le convertir en mono en faisant la moyenne des canaux gauche et droit, car les événements sonores significatifs sont normalement présents dans les deux canaux. 2. Découper le signal audio en fenêtres temporelles (chunks). La durée de ces fenêtres dépendra de la résolution temporelle souhaitée. 3. Calculer le RMS pour chaque fenêtre. 4. Trouver les points où le RMS est plus élevé que dans les fenêtres adjacentes. Ces points correspondent aux pics de volume. 5. Il est également possible d'ajouter un seuil afin d'ignorer les variations de volume qui ne sont pas significatives. 6. Sélectionner les \`N\` plus grands pics pour limiter le résultat aux \`N\` moments les plus forts. En Python, pour le traitement audio, des bibliothèques comme \`pydub\` ou \`scipy\` peuvent être utilisées pour effectuer cette analyse. Voici un exemple de la façon dont on pourrait trouver les pics de volume avec \`scipy\` : \`\`\`python from scipy.io import wavfile import numpy as np # Charger un fichier WAV et convertir en mono s'il est stéréo samplerate, data = wavfile.read('audio_file.wav') if data.ndim > 1: data = data.mean(axis=1) # Calculer le RMS sur des fenêtres frame_size = int(samplerate * window_duration_in_seconds) # window_duration_in_seconds est la durée de chaque fenêtre (chunk) rms = np.array([np.sqrt(np.mean(data[i:i+frame_size]**2)) for i in range(0, len(data), frame_size)]) # Trouver les indices des plus grands RMS loudest_indices = np.argsort(rms)[-max_instants:] # Convertir les indices en temps, si nécessaire loudest_times = loudest_indices / samplerate \`\`\` Gardez à l'esprit que cette approche peut nécessiter une optimisation et une configuration pour correspondre exactement aux exigences de votre application spécifique, comme définir un seuil approprié et déterminer le niveau de précision temporelle souhaité."},{"prompt":"Le dernier script en date détermine-t-il les pics sonores, de façons décroissante, pour déterminer les extraits vidéos à créer ?","completion":"Excusez-moi pour toute confusion précédente. L'exemple que j'ai donné précédemment ne fournit pas directement la capacité à trier les pics sonores de façon décroissante pour ensuite déterminer les extraits vidéos à créer. Voici donc un exemple mis à jour qui procède à l'analyse des pics de volume d'une piste audio pour les identifier dans l'ordre décroissant du pic de volume avant d'extraire les clips vidéo correspondants. Il faudra utiliser la fonction \`find_loudest_moments\` pour trouver les instants les plus forts, trier ces instants par volume sonore (du plus fort au moins fort), et ensuite utiliser ces instants pour extraire les clips vidéo.

Bu makale derleme bir makale olsun. Aynı zamanda zengin bir atıf ve kaynakça olsun.","completion":"\\"Sosyal Bilgiler Öğretiminde Bir Sanal Öğrenme Ortamı olarak Roblox Oyunu: Derleme ve İnceleme\\" ÖZET 21. yüzyılın öğretim metodolojileri, teknolojik ilerlemelerin ışığında, öğrencilerin öğrenme deneyimlerini daha etkileşimli ve motivasyonel hale getirmek için sürekli dönüşmektedir. Bu dönüşüm, sosyal bilgiler gibi alanlarda geleneksel öğretim metotlarının ötesine geçmeyi gerektirmektedir. Bu çalışma, Roblox oyun platformunun sosyal bilgiler öğretiminde nasıl bir sanal öğrenme ortamı olarak kullanılabileceğini incelemekte ve derlemektedir. Bu bağlamda öğretim teknikleri, öğrenci katılımı ve motivasyonu, bilgi transferi ve pedagojik stratejiler üzerindeki etkileri irdelenmektedir. 1. GİRİŞ Geleneksel öğretim yöntemlerinin öğrencileri yeterince motive etmediği ve \\"dijital yerliler\\" olarak anılan mevcut öğrenci nesilleri için yeterince ilgi çekici olmadığı yönünde artan bir görüş birliği mevcuttur (Prensky, 2001). Bu sebeple, eğitimciler sosyal bilgiler gibi insan etkileşimlerini ve toplumu anlamak için kritik olan derslerde öğrenmeyi canlandırmak ve derinleştirmek için yeni yollar aramaktadır. Burada Roblox, sosyal öğrenme teorilerini (Bandura, 1977) destekleyen ve sosyal becerilerin gelişimine imkan tanıyan bir platform olarak öne çıkmaktadır. 2. ROBLOX'UN EĞİTİMSEL DEĞERİ Roblox, kullanıcının oyunlar oluşturabileceği veya diğer kullanıcılar tarafından oluşturulan oyunlarda oynayabileceği çevrimiçi bir platformdur (Baszucki & Cassel, 2006). Bu platform, sosyal bilgiler öğretiminde kullanıldığında, tarihi yeniden canlandırma, toplumdaki rolleri deneyimleme ve farklı sosyo-ekonomik sistemleri anlama fırsatları sunar (Delialioglu, 2012). 3. SOSYAL BİLGİLER ÖĞRETİMİNDE ROBLOX'UN ROLÜ Çeşitli çalışmalar, Roblox'un öğrenciler arasında iş birliği, etkileşim ve sosyal becerileri teşvik ettiğini göstermiştir (Gee, 2003). Sosyal bilgiler dersleri için Roblox'ta yaratılan sanal dünyalar, öğrencilerin demokrasi, iktisat, ve vatandaşlık gibi konseptleri gerçek zamanlı, etkileşimli ortamlarda öğrenme şansını artırmaktadır (Barab et al., 2009). 4. PEDAGOJİK YAKLAŞIMLAR VE UYGULAMA STRATEJİLERİ Eğitimciler, yaratıcı ve problem çözme becerilerini geliştirebilmek için Roblox'u pedagojik bir araç olarak kullanabilirler. Öğretmenlerin Roblox'u etkin bir şekilde kullanmak için oyun tabanlı öğrenme (OBL) ve çağdaş pedagojik yaklaşımları anlamaları önemlidir (Prensky, 2001). Bu yaklaşımların içerisinde dönüştürücü öğrenme teorisi (Mezirow, 1991), yapısalcılık (Piaget, 1954), ve sosyal yapılandırmacılık (Vygotsky, 1978) yer almaktadır. 5. MEVCUT LİTERATÜR VE ARAŞTIRMALAR Yapılan araştırmalar Roblox'un, sosyal bilgiler derslerinde öğrencilerin kavramsal anlamalarını artırdığına ve öğrenme sürecini daha anlamlı kıldığına işaret etmektedir (Malone, 1981). Öğrencilerin içerikle etkileşime girmesi, öğrenme sürecini eğlenceli ve hatırlanabilir kılabilmektedir (Dewey, 1938). Sosyal bilgiler derslerinde Roblox kullanımına dair pragmatik araştırmalar (Tüzün et al., 2009), öğrenci yeterliliklerinin ve etkileşim düzeylerinin arttığını gözlemlemiştir. 6. SONUÇ VE TAVSİYELER Sosyal bilgiler öğretiminde Roblox'u etkili bir şekilde kullanabilmek için, eğitimcilerin ve okul yöneticilerinin bu tür yenilikçi öğretim araçlarına açık olması ve bu araçların pedagojik stratejilere göre entegrasyonuna izin vermesi gerekmektedir. Gelecekteki araştırmalar, Roblox gibi platformların eğitim amaçlı kullanımının daha geniş kapsamlı ve uzun vadeli etkilerini incelemelidir.

We read and discuss various works, write poetry, and sometimes even have themed events. It's a safe and welcoming space for creativity and friendship. Natsuki: And that's why I thought it would be great for Sakura to join. She's already got a knack for storytelling and an impressive imagination. Plus, she's my little bookworm!

(나는 내 일을 마쳤다.) 2. 수동태를 만들 때: be 동사와 함께 사용되어 수동태를 형성합니다. - 예: The book was written by George. (그 책은 조지에 의해 쓰여졌다.) 3. 형용사로 사용될 때: 과거분사는 형용사처럼 사용되어 명사를 수식할 수 있습니다. - 예: The broken window needs to be fixed. (깨진 창문은 고쳐져야 한다.) 4. 분사구문을 만들 때: 문장의 주어와 동작을 수행하는 주체가 같을 때, 과거분사를 사용하여 분사구문을 만들 수 있습니다. - 예: Given the opportunity, he would travel the world. (기회가 주어진다면, 그는 세계를 여행할 것이다.) 과거분사의 형태는 정규동사(regular verbs)의 경우, 동사의 기본형에 '-ed'를 붙여 만듭니다 (예: walk → walked, clean → cleaned). 그러나 불규칙동사(irregular verbs)의 경우, 특별한 형태를 가지고 있으며 이를 암기해야 합니다 (예: go → gone, see → seen, write → written). 한국어 사용자가 과거분사를 이해하고 올바르게 사용하기 위해서는 정규동사와 불규칙동사의 과거분사 형태를 연습하고, 과거분사가 사용되는 다양한 문맥을 학습하는 것이 중요합니다."},{"prompt":"영어의 과거분사는 과거형과 어떤 차이가 있는가?","completion":"영어에서 과거분사(past participle)와 과거형(simple past)은 모두 과거와 관련된 동사의 형태이지만, 사용 목적과 문법적 기능에 차이가 있습니다. 1. 과거형(Simple Past): - 과거형은 과거의 특정한 시점에 일어난 동작이나 상태를 나타냅니다. - 과거형은 단독으로 동사의 주요 형태로 사용되며, 주로 단순 과거 시제를 표현할 때 사용됩니다. - 정규동사의 과거형은 기본형에 '-ed'를 붙여 만들어지고, 불규칙 동사는 특별한 과거형을 가집니다 (예: go → went, see → saw). - 예문: I walked to school yesterday. (나는 어제 학교에 걸어갔다.) 2. 과거분사(Past Participle): - 과거분사는 완료 시제(perfect tenses), 수동태(passive voice), 형용사(adjective), 분사구문(participle clauses) 등에서 사용됩니다. - 과거분사는 독립적으로 사용되기보다는 보조동사(auxiliary verbs)와 함께 사용되어 복잡한 시제나 문법 구조를 만듭니다. - 정규동사의 과거분사 형태는 과거형과 동일하게 '-ed'를 붙여 만들어지지만, 불규칙 동사는 고유의 과거분사 형태를 가집니다 (예: go → gone, see → seen). - 예문: I have walked to school. (나는 학교에 걸어간 적이 있다.) - 예문: The book was written by the author. (그 책은 저자에 의해 쓰여졌다.) 요약하자면, 과거형은 과거의 단순한 사실이나 동작을 직접적으로 나타내는 반면, 과거분사는 주로 보조동사와 함께 사용되어 더 복잡한 시제나 문법적 구조를 형성하는 데 사용됩니다. 또한, 불규칙 동사의 경우 과거형과 과거분사 형태가 서로 다를 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"아래 코드를 이해할 수 있는가? \`\`\` <body class=\\"post-template-default single single-post postid-68011 single-format-standard custom-background wp-embed-responsive ta-hide-date-author-in-list\\"><div id=\\"page\\" class=\\"site\\"> <a class=\\"skip-link screen-reader-text\\" href=\\"#content\\"> Skip to content</a><div class=\\"wrapper\\"><header class=\\"mg-headwidget center\\"><div class=\\"clearfix\\"></div><div class=\\"mg-nav-widget-area-back\\" style=\\"background-image: url(&quot;https://s5.watchfreejavonline.co/wp-content/themes/newslay02/images/head-back.jpg&quot; );\\"><div class=\\"overlay\\"><div class=\\"inner\\" style=\\"background-color:rgba(41,46,61,0.7);\\"><div class=\\"container-fluid\\"><div class=\\"mg-nav-widget-area\\"><div class=\\"row align-items-center\\"><div class=\\"col-md-4 col-sm-4 text-center-xs\\"><div class=\\"heacent\\">Sat.

Their positive experiences and recommendations prompted my interest in the role. Do you have prior sales experience? * Yes, I do. Below are highlights of my relevant sales experience: International Laboratory for Human Genome Research (LIIGH-UNAM) [April 2023 - Decembre 2023]: I worked as a Bioinformatics Intern, a field related to my degree in medicine genomics. Apart from the primary bioinformatics and bioengineering tasks, I was also charged with the promotion and sale of the laboratory’s services, which predominantly comprised software-related solutions, to prospective clients in other laboratories throughout Mexico and South America. During this time, I effectively made connections across Peru (UPCH Molecular Biology Lab - Zimic’s Lab) and Argentina (UBA Bioinformatics Lab) to provide LIIGH’s big data solutions. MatLab [June 2018 - December 2019]: Concurrent with my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Mathematics Tutor at MatLab. My role extended beyond instructing students in mathematics; it also necessitated a skill for sales and customer relations. MatLab provided the initial connections, but it was my responsibility to secure agreements with parents, positioning myself as the preferred tutor for their children. In this position, I successfully closed over 30 tutoring agreements, subsequently providing personalized instruction to an equivalent number of students. Kantu Aromatherapy [June 2015 - December 2017]: Before going to college, I worked as a front seller for Kantu, a small aromatherapy startup. In this role, I was responsible for a range of tasks, including: setting up sales displays at local weekend markets, preparing product presentations, and actively engaging customers to promote and sell our aromatherapy products. During this time, my efforts contributed to a substantial growth in revenue, resulting in an approximate 20% increase in sales. What attracted you to this position and why do you feel that you would be a good fit? * I was drawn to this position at GrowthCave for a few key reasons. First off, many of my friends work here and they always talk about how great the atmosphere is. Hearing about the supportive and friendly work environment from people I trust made me want to be part of the team too. I’m also really into the way GrowthCave thinks about business. They’re all about seeing the glass as half full, being brave enough to jump on new chances, and making the most out of what they’ve got. I like that kind of positive thinking and I’ve always tried to take smart risks in my own career. When it comes to why I’d be a good fit, I have a background in sales where I’ve had to figure out how to talk about all kinds of products and get people interested in them. Whether it was explaining complex services at LIIGH-UNAM, building trust with parents at MatLab, or chatting with customers at the aromatherapy startup, I’ve learned how to connect with different types of people and find out what they need. With what I know about sales and how I approach things, I feel like I can really add something to the team at GrowthCave. Plus, I’m super interested in the digital advertising world, and I think combining that with everything I’ve done before could lead to some awesome results for us and the clients. Is there anything else you'd like to share with our team? * Yes, I’d like to add that I’m a quick learner who’s always up for a challenge. My academic background and past sales experiences have taught me how to tackle complex information and translate it into something that’s easy for customers to understand and get excited about. Also, teamwork means a lot to me. I believe that the best results come from people working together, sharing ideas, and supporting each other. From what I’ve heard, that’s how things work at GrowthCave, and I’m looking forward to being part of such a collaborative atmosphere. Lastly, I really value clear and open communication. I think it’s key in building trust, both within a team and with clients. I’m someone who always tries to keep the lines of communication open, and I believe that skill would serve me well in this role. introducing yourself, (this) Hi, my name is Alejandro, I’m 23 years old, born and raised in Lima, Perú, and recently graduated as a veterinarian with a specialization in medicine informatics. giving your overall thoughts of our offer/videos, (this) why you want this role, (this) and why we should hire you (this)","completion":"Certainly!

Aqui estão algumas das semelhanças: 1. Ambientação Histórica em Tempos de Guerra: - \\"Capitão América: O Primeiro Vingador\\" é ambientado principalmente durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial. - \\"Mulher-Maravilha\\" é ambientada durante a Primeira Guerra Mundial. 2. Origem dos Heróis: - Ambos os filmes funcionam como uma história de origem, mostrando como os personagens principais se tornaram super-heróis. - Steve Rogers (Capitão América) e Diana Prince (Mulher-Maravilha) são inicialmente ingênuos quanto à realidade fora de seus mundos pequenos e protegidos. 3. Heróis Idealistas: - Os dois personagens principais são retratados como idealistas que querem lutar pelo que é certo e contra as forças do mal. - Ambos possuem um forte senso de justiça e desejam intervir na guerra para pôr fim ao conflito. 4. Elementos Sobrenaturais e Científicos: - Tanto Mulher-Maravilha quanto Capitão América obtêm suas habilidades através de meios extraordinários - Diana é uma semideusa, filha de Zeus, e Steve Rogers é um franzino transformado em supersoldado por meio de um soro experimental. 5. Figuras Antagônicas: - Nos dois filmes, os vilões estão associados às respectivas guerras mundiais e possuem motivações baseadas em poder e dominação. - Tanto \\"Mulher-Maravilha\\" quanto \\"Capitão América\\" apresentam antagonistas secundários que estão manipulando a guerra para seus próprios fins malignos. 6. Figuras de Mentor: - A personagem de Peggy Carter em \\"Capitão América\\" e Steve Trevor em \\"Mulher-Maravilha\\" servem como mentores e interesses amorosos, ajudando a orientar os heróis em seu envolvimento com o mundo maior. 7. Equipe de Apoio: - Ambos os heróis montam uma equipe de companheiros combatentes de diferentes origens e especialidades para ajudá-los em suas missões. 8. Cena de Infiltração: - Cenas memoráveis em ambos os filmes apresentam os protagonistas infiltrando-se em galas para confrontar o vilão ou obter informações cruciais. 9. Sacríficio Heroico: - Em ambos os filmes, um sacrifício significativo é feito, com Steve Rogers se sacrificando para salvar milhões no final de \\"Capitão América\\" e Steve Trevor se sacrificando em \\"Mulher-Maravilha\\". Mesmo com essas semelhanças, vale destacar que os dois filmes têm identidades únicas, com suas próprias narrativas, estilos e desenvolvimentos de personagens distintos.

Here are a couple of interpretations: 1. **Nazi Concentration Camp Badge**: Historically, an upside-down red triangle was used by the Nazis to mark political prisoners in concentration camps. People who were communists, socialists, social democrats, Freemasons, or members of other opposition parties were identified with this symbol. 2. **Political Advertisements and Campaigns**: In more recent times, the symbol was used controversially by the 2020 reelection campaign for former US President Donald Trump. The campaign used the upside-down red triangle in some Facebook ads about Antifa, a loosely organized movement of anti-fascist groups. Critics of the administration pointed out the historical Nazi association and condemned its use, claiming it was a dog whistle to far-right groups. Facebook later removed these ads, citing its policy against organized hate. Using Nazi-related symbols and iconography in political discourse is highly sensitive and is typically criticized for its association with hate, anti-Semitism, and authoritarianism. They often draw sharp rebuke and are grounds for content removal on major social media platforms due to policies against hate speech. As with any politically charged symbol, interpretations can differ widely. It is essential to consider the context and the intent of usage to understand the specific meaning in a given situation."},{"prompt":"Good morning","completion":"Good morning!

Converting methane into a substance that releases less carbon when burned is not straightforward because the combustion of any hydrocarbon will inherently produce CO₂ due to the oxidation of the carbon atoms. However, there are some approaches to mitigate the carbon emissions from methane combustion: 1. **Methane Capture and Utilization**: Before methane is burned, it can be captured and used as a feedstock to create chemicals or materials that do not release CO₂ when used. For example, methane can be converted into methanol (CH₃OH), which can be further processed to produce various chemicals. 2. **Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)**: While this does not reduce carbon emissions from combustion, methane can be converted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide through SMR. The hydrogen can then be used as a fuel that produces water when combusted, without direct carbon emissions. 3. **Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**: This technology aims to capture CO₂ emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels like methane and store them underground, preventing them from entering the atmosphere. 4. **Methane Combustion with Renewable Oxygen**: Burning methane with pure oxygen (O₂) instead of air (which contains nitrogen) would produce only carbon dioxide and water, without nitrogen oxides (NOx). The CO₂ could then be more easily captured and stored. This process is known as oxy-fuel combustion. 5. **Biogas Upgrading and Renewable Natural Gas**: Biogas, which contains methane, can be produced from organic waste. Through a process known as upgrading, impurities and carbon dioxide are removed, leaving a high-methane-content gas called renewable natural gas (RNG). When RNG is burned, it still releases CO₂, but the overall process can be considered carbon-neutral because the methane was generated from current biological sources that captured CO₂ from the atmosphere. 6. **Catalytic Methane Decomposition**: This is an emerging technology that decomposes methane into hydrogen and solid carbon. The hydrogen can be used as a clean fuel, and the solid carbon can be sequestered or utilized in various industries. 7. **Methane Hydrate Conversion**: Methane can be found naturally in the form of methane hydrates, which can potentially be converted into carbon dioxide hydrates, which are more stable. This conversion under the sea floor could theoretically sequester carbon dioxide while releasing methane for use as an energy source. However, this technology is currently hypothetical and would entail various practical and environmental challenges. Each of these methods has its challenges and limitations, including economic viability, energy requirements, and infrastructure needs, but research and development in these areas continue to advance as the world seeks to mitigate climate change impacts."},{"prompt":"ok so what about using methane in a way that doesnt relaese carbon dioxide , i want to burn it but somehow not produce co2 , is there a catalytic method like a catalytic heater ?","completion":"Burning methane without releasing CO2 is chemically challenging because combustion inherently involves the oxidation of the carbon atoms in methane, leading to the formation of CO2. However, there is a process called \\"methane pyrolysis\\" that can convert methane into hydrogen gas (H2) and solid carbon. This process is also sometimes referred to as methane cracking or methane decomposition. The hydrogen produced can then be used as a fuel that only releases water vapor when burned. Methane pyrolysis typically requires high temperatures (above 750 degrees Celsius) and can be facilitated by catalysts to lower the reaction temperature and improve efficiency. Various catalytic materials, such as metal-based catalysts including nickel, iron, and others, can be employed to assist the reaction. The reaction is as follows: CH₄ → C(s) + 2H₂(g) During this process: - Methane (CH₄) is decomposed into solid carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H₂). - The solid carbon produced can be a valuable by-product if it's in the form of carbon black, graphene, or another useful carbon allotrope. - The hydrogen gas can be used as a clean fuel in fuel cells or combustion engines. While methane pyrolysis does not release CO2 directly, it is important to consider the source of the energy used to achieve the high temperatures required for the reaction. If fossil fuels are used to generate the necessary heat, CO2 emissions could still occur indirectly. Therefore, the environmental benefits are maximized when renewable energy sources are used for the heating process. It is worth emphasizing that methane pyrolysis is an area of ongoing research and is not yet widely deployed at commercial scales. Also, while methane pyrolysis does not release CO2 during the conversion process, any subsequent use of the hydrogen (unless it is used in a fuel cell to generate electricity) will result in some level of emissions, although these are much lower than those resulting from methane combustion."},{"prompt":"ok then what other burnable products can hydrogen be converted to , other than methane","completion":"Hydrogen itself is a clean-burning fuel; when combusted, it simply produces water vapor and releases energy. Unlike hydrocarbons like methane, hydrogen does not contain carbon atoms, so its combustion does not directly result in CO2 or other carbon compounds. However, hydrogen can be chemically converted into various other substances, some of which are burnable and more easily handled or transported than hydrogen gas. Some of these substances include: 1. **Ammonia (NH3)**: Hydrogen can be reacted with nitrogen in the Haber-Bosch process to produce ammonia, a colorless gas with potential as a fuel. It can be liquefied under mild pressure and temperature conditions, which makes it easier to transport and store compared to hydrogen. When burned, ammonia does not produce CO2, but it can produce nitrogen oxides (NOx), although technologies are being developed to mitigate this. 2. **Methanol (CH3OH)**: Hydrogen can be combined with carbon monoxide (CO) or carbon dioxide (CO2) over a catalyst to form methanol. Methanol is a liquid at room temperature, which facilitates its storage and transport. Burning methanol does result in CO2 emissions, but if the CO or CO2 is sourced from the atmosphere or industrial waste gases, the process can be part of a carbon-neutral cycle. 3. **Hydrogen carriers**: These are substances that can chemically store hydrogen and release it upon demand. They are not necessarily \\"burnable\\" in the traditional sense, but they provide a way to transport and use hydrogen energy. Examples of hydrogen carriers include liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) and chemical hydrides like sodium borohydride (NaBH4). 4. **Synthetic hydrocarbons**: Hydrogen can be used to synthesize longer-chain hydrocarbons via processes like Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These synthetic hydrocarbons can be used as drop-in fuels for existing internal combustion engines. The carbon used in this process would ideally come from captured CO2 to maintain a low-carbon or carbon-neutral footprint. 5. **Hydrocarbons from electrocatalytic reduction**: Electrochemical processes can convert CO2 and hydrogen to hydrocarbons like ethylene (C2H4) and others. If the electricity for these processes is derived from renewable sources, and the CO2 is captured from the atmosphere or industrial emissions, the resulting hydrocarbons would have a lower carbon footprint when burned. 6. **Dimethyl ether (DME, CH3OCH3)**: Hydrogen can react with carbon monoxide to produce DME, a gas that can be used as a fuel. DME is similar to propane and has a high cetane number, which makes it suitable for diesel engines, with the advantage of minimal soot and NOx emissions. DME does produce CO2 when burned, but like methanol, it can be produced in a more environmentally friendly manner if the carbon comes from renewable sources. When considering environmentally friendly energy cycles, it is important to assess the full carbon footprint of the processes involved, including the source of carbon (if carbon-containing fuels are created), the energy inputs required, and the emissions during the use phase. The goal is to move towards more sustainable, carbon-neutral, or even carbon-negative technologies."},{"prompt":"what state is tio2 in is it a +3 or +4 state as ordinary anatase","completion":"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) typically exists in the +4 oxidation state, with titanium being in the form of Ti^4+. This is true for all the common polymorphs of TiO2, including anatase, rutile, and brookite. In these compounds, each titanium ion is surrounded by six oxygen atoms in an octahedral coordination geometry. TiO2 is favored in the +4 oxidation state because of the full valence shell stability it achieves in this configuration. Although titanium can exist in other oxidation states (+3, +2, and even +1), the Ti^4+ state is the most stable and common form found in nature and in most titanium oxide compounds."},{"prompt":"how are the lower valent types produced ?","completion":"Lower valent titanium oxides, where titanium is in the +3 or +2 oxidation state, can be produced through various synthetic routes. Here are some of the methods used to create titanium oxides with titanium in the +3 (Ti^3+) or +2 (Ti^2+) oxidation states: 1. **Reduction of TiO2**: The most common way to produce lower valent titanium oxides is by reducing titanium dioxide (TiO2) under controlled conditions. This can be achieved using: - **Hydrogen gas (H2)** at elevated temperatures, which acts as a reducing agent to convert Ti^4+ to Ti^3+ or Ti^2+. - **Carbon-containing materials** such as coke or carbon monoxide (CO), which can reduce TiO2 at high temperatures. - **Strong reducing agents** in solution, such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4), can also be used for the reduction under milder conditions, though this method may be suited for producing thin films or nanoparticles rather than bulk material. 2. **High-Temperature Arc Melting**: By melting a mixture of titanium and titanium dioxide in an electric arc furnace, it's possible to control the oxygen content and thereby adjust the oxidation state of titanium in the resulting alloy or compound. 3. **Thermal Decomposition**: Heating certain titanium oxygen compounds, such as certain titanates, can lead to the loss of oxygen and the formation of reduced titanium oxides. The degree of reduction can be controlled by the temperature and atmosphere (inert or reducing) in which the decomposition takes place. 4. **Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE)** and **Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD)**: These sophisticated techniques allow for the controlled deposition of thin films where the stoichiometry, and thereby the oxidation state of titanium, can be finely tuned by controlling the deposition parameters. 5. **Electrochemical Methods**: By applying an electrical potential, titanium can be electrochemically reduced, either in molten salt solutions or in aqueous electrolytes containing complexing agents. 6. **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)**: This process involves vaporizing a titanium precursor along with a controlled amount of an reducing agent; the deposition of titanium onto a substrate will then occur with reduced oxidation states depending on the experimental conditions. When producing these lower valent titanium oxides, it's necessary to maintain an oxygen-deficient (reducing) environment to prevent the oxidation of titanium back to its more stable +4 state. The specific method chosen can also affect the properties of the titanium oxide produced, such as its crystallinity, morphology, and particle size. Lower valent titanium oxides are of interest for various applications including electronics, catalysis, and energy storage because of their distinct electric and catalytic properties different from those of TiO2. However, they tend to be less stable in ambient conditions and can readily oxidize back to TiO2 upon exposure to air or moisture."},{"prompt":"how much strontium metal is in 1kg of strontium carbonate ?","completion":"To determine the amount of strontium metal in 1 kg of strontium carbonate (SrCO3), we can use stoichiometry to calculate the mass fraction of strontium within the compound.

When selecting the best thermal paste for an aluminum heatsink attached to an SSR, there are certain qualities you want to consider: 1. **Thermal Conductivity**: The thermal paste should have a high thermal conductivity, usually measured in watts per meter-kelvin (W/mK). Higher values typically correspond to better heat transfer capabilities. 2. **Electrical Insulation**: Since SSRs deal with electricity, it's critical that the thermal paste is electrically non-conductive to prevent any potential short circuits. 3. **Viscosity and Ease of Application**: The paste should be easy to apply evenly across the SSR's surface, ensuring optimal contact with the heatsink. 4. **Durability and Longevity**: A good thermal paste should maintain its performance over a wide temperature range and not dry out or degrade over time, ensuring a long-lasting thermal bond. 5. **Compatibility with Materials**: The thermal paste should not cause corrosion or other damage to the SSR or the aluminum heatsink; it should be chemically inert to these materials. Based on these criteria, there are several thermal pastes on the market that are suitable for use with aluminum heatsinks on SSRs. Some options that are often recommended for high-performance cooling applications include: - **Arctic MX-4**: Known for its high thermal conductivity, ease of application, and safeness since it's non-conductive and non-capacitive. - **Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut**: A premium thermal paste that's popular among enthusiasts for its excellent thermal performance and electrical insulation properties. - **Noctua NT-H1**: A well-regarded thermal paste that is easy to apply, has good thermal performance, and doesn't need a curing time. - **Arctic Silver 5**: Though it has a slight electrical conductivity due to its silver content, when applied properly it's a reliable choice for heat transfer in many applications. However, ensure that it doesn't come in contact with any electrical traces or components. When choosing a thermal paste, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for both the paste and the SSR to ensure proper application. Apply only the necessary amount of thermal paste to form a thin and even layer, as excessive paste may act as an insulator and hinder heat transfer. Please note that while these thermal pastes are quite popular, it's always advisable to check technical specifications to ensure suitability for your specific SSR application, especially concerning operating temperature ranges and potential contact with electrical components."},{"prompt":"titanium dioxide , valence states , would it be possible to make titanium monoxide , and what would be its valence state","completion":"Titanium monoxide (TiO) is indeed a compound that can be formed, albeit less common and stable compared to titanium dioxide (TiO2). In titanium monoxide, titanium typically exhibits a +2 oxidation state, and oxygen exhibits a -2 oxidation state, which is consistent with the stoichiometry of the compound (Ti^2+O^2-). TiO is known for having a non-stoichiometric composition, often existing as TiO_x where x can slightly deviate from 1. The crystal structure of TiO can accommodate a range of titanium and oxygen compositions by creating vacancies in its crystal lattice. This characteristic makes TiO a non-stoichiometric compound, meaning its composition is not fixed and can vary. The synthesis of titanium monoxide typically involves high-temperature processes and a carefully controlled environment to prevent the titanium from fully oxidizing to TiO2 or reducing to the metallic state. Such methods may include: - Vacuum arc melting or induction melting of titanium in a controlled partial pressure of oxygen. - Solid-state reaction of titanium powder with titanium dioxide under reducing conditions. - Sputtering titanium in an argon-oxygen mixed atmosphere with precise control over the oxygen partial pressure. Due to its non-stoichiometric nature, the properties of TiO can vary; it is often used in research materials related to conductive ceramics and as a potential electrode material in electronic devices. However, due to its potential reactivity and the exacting conditions required for its formation, TiO is not typically used in large quantities commercially and is mainly of interest in specialized applications and scientific studies."},{"prompt":"so if it were formed it would need to be kept in zero oxygen condition or it would take on another oxygen ?","completion":"Titanium monoxide (TiO) is indeed a stable phase under certain conditions, but it can readily react with oxygen due to its non-stoichiometric nature. Given that TiO can exist in a range where there may be a deficit of oxygen (TiO_x with x slightly less than 1), the compound can absorb additional oxygen to move towards a more stoichiometrically balanced or oxidized state, such as TiO2, which is more thermodynamically stable under normal atmospheric conditions. To prevent the oxidation of TiO to TiO2 or another higher oxide, it should ideally be stored and handled in an oxygen-free (or low-oxygen) environment. This could be an inert atmosphere like argon or nitrogen, or in a vacuum, especially at elevated temperatures where the reaction kinetics would be faster. It is not only the presence of oxygen that can affect TiO, however. Temperature and moisture can also influence its stability and potential for further oxidation. Therefore, preserving the TiO in its intended oxidation state requires stringent control over its environment. In practical applications or during experiments, when you want to maintain the specific properties of TiO, it is important to minimize its exposure to both air and moisture.

While titanium can exist in several oxidation states, including +2 and +3 (seen in titanium monoxide, TiO, and dititanium trioxide, Ti2O3, respectively), the trioxide formulation TiO3 does not represent a typical or stable stoichiometry for titanium compounds. The compound that might be considered as titanium \\"trioxide\\" is actually Ti2O3, where each titanium atom has a +3 oxidation state, resulting in a stable compound. Ti2O3 is a black powder that is stable in inert or reducing atmospheres; however, it will oxidize to TiO2 if heated in the presence of air. In materials science and solid-state chemistry, the non-stoichiometric nature of many transition metal oxides is well-recognized. This means that oxides can exist with slightly less or slightly more oxygen than what simple integer stoichiometries would suggest. Nonetheless, TiO3 as a discrete compound is not typically encountered or expected to be stable, especially in an ambient environment where TiO2 is the preferred oxide form. If any reference is made to TiO3, it may be in the context of theoretical studies, non-stoichiometric phases, or specific coordination complexes rather than a stable, bulk oxide compound. As for the \\"valence state\\" in your question, it is generally used to refer to the oxidation state of the metal in its compound. In the case of TiO3, if it were to exist hypothetically, titanium might be expected to have an oxidation state less than +4 but greater than +2 to satisfy the valence of three oxide ions, each with a -2 charge.

Ti2O3 is an example of a lower oxidation state titanium oxide, where titanium is in the +3 oxidation state. The methods to synthesize Ti2O3 typically involve reducing environments to prevent the titanium from fully oxidizing to TiO2 (+4 oxidation state), which is more stable in air. Here are some common methods used to produce Ti2O3: 1. **Reduction of Titanium Dioxide (TiO2):** Controlled reduction of TiO2 by hydrogen gas (H2) at high temperatures can produce Ti2O3. This method requires precise control over the temperature and the amount of hydrogen to avoid complete reduction to metallic titanium. 2. **Solid-State Reaction:** A solid-state reaction between titanium dioxide (TiO2) and titanium metal (Ti) can yield Ti2O3 when heated under a vacuum or an inert gas atmosphere to prevent oxidation. 3. **Arc Melting or Induction Melting:** Melting a stoichiometric mixture of titanium metal and titanium dioxide in a non-oxidizing atmosphere using an arc furnace or an induction furnace can form Ti2O3. The partial pressure of oxygen during melting can be controlled to obtain the desired oxide. 4. **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD):** Utilizing titanium precursors and a carefully regulated oxygen partial pressure, Ti2O3 thin films can be deposited on substrates. 5. **Aluminothermic Reduction:** Titanium dioxide can be reduced by aluminum powder in a process similar to the thermite reaction, where aluminum acts as a strong reducing agent to lower the oxidation state of titanium. 6. **Electrochemical Synthesis:** An electrochemical process can be used to reduce TiO2 to Ti2O3 in a solution containing a suitable electrolyte. It is essential to note that synthesis of Ti2O3 often requires careful control over experimental conditions. Maintaining low oxygen partial pressures and proper temperatures is crucial for the successful formation of Ti2O3 without progressing to TiO2 formation or reduction to Ti metal.

TiO2 exists predominantly in the +4 oxidation state, which is stable and highly resistant to reduction under normal environmental conditions. To modify the valence state of titanium in TiO2 to a lower oxidation state such as +2, or to create defects that mimic a lower oxidation state, certain techniques can be employed: 1. **Doping with Metals or Nonmetals**: Doping TiO2 with other elements can introduce defects or localized states within the band structure that alter its electronic properties. Some common dopants include transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni) and nonmetals (e.g., N, C, S). These dopants can create new energy levels within the band gap or modify the charge carrier density, effectively changing the material's photocatalytic behavior. 2. **Hydrogenation**: Treating TiO2 with hydrogen gas under high temperatures (a process known as hydrogenation or annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere) can create oxygen vacancies and Ti^3+ centers. These defects can act as trap states for electrons, enhancing the photocatalytic activity by improving electron-hole pair separation. 3. **High-Energy Particle Irradiation**: Techniques like ion implantation or electron beam irradiation can generate non-stoichiometric defects and Ti^3+ states in the lattice of TiO2. 4. **Reductive Doping**: Exposing TiO2 to strong chemical reducing agents such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) can induce a reduced form of titanium oxide. 5. **Synthesis Under Reducing Conditions**: Preparing TiO2 precursors in the presence of reducing agents or under low oxygen partial pressures can form non-stoichiometric TiO2 with reduced titanium states. It's important to understand the distinction between true reduction of the titanium oxidation state and the introduction of defects that have similar effects on electronic properties. In most cases, changes induced in TiO2's electronic structure are due to defects and dopants rather than a global reduction of the titanium from the +4 to the +2 oxidation state throughout the material. Inducing a lower oxidation state and creating defects in TiO2 may modify its photocatalytic activity, often enhancing its performance under visible light. Such modifications can extend the absorption edge of TiO2 from the ultraviolet (UV) region into the visible spectrum, making it more effective for practical applications where UV light is limited. When attempting these modifications, it is crucial to control the process conditions to obtain the desired photocatalyst properties while maintaining the material's stability and ensuring that it remains active and effective over time."},{"prompt":"ok so it's just a case of doping , ok like nitrogen doping i guess","completion":"Yes, nitrogen doping is one of the strategies often used to enhance the photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide (TiO2). Nitrogen doping can help extend the absorption of TiO2 into the visible light range, making the material active under solar or indoor light, which is mostly in the visible spectrum. This is important because undoped TiO2 primarily absorbs ultraviolet (UV) light, which constitutes only a small fraction of the solar spectrum. Nitrogen-doped TiO2 can be synthesized through several methods: 1. **Thermal Annealing in Nitrogen Atmosphere**: Heating TiO2 in the presence of a nitrogen-rich environment, such as pure nitrogen gas or ammonia, can incorporate nitrogen into the TiO2 lattice. 2. **Sol-gel Processing with Nitrogen-containing Precursors**: During the sol-gel process, using nitrogen-containing compounds like urea, ammonium nitrate, or amines can introduce nitrogen into the TiO2 structure. 3. **Plasma Treatments**: Exposure to nitrogen plasma can facilitate the incorporation of nitrogen into the surface layers of TiO2. 4. **Ion Implantation**: High-energy nitrogen ions can be implanted into the TiO2 crystal lattice. 5. **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)**: Introducing nitrogen gas or a nitrogen-containing precursor into the CVD process can result in nitrogen doping of the TiO2 layers being deposited. Nitrogen doping can create mid-gap states or substitute for oxygen atoms in the TiO2 lattice, which can modify the band structure and reduce the band gap. These changes allow the material to be photoactive under visible light and enhance the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, improving photocatalytic efficiency. The efficiency of nitrogen doping and its effect on photocatalysis greatly depends on factors such as the doping level, the method employed, and the particle size and crystalline phase of the TiO2. Moreover, researchers are looking into co-doping with nitrogen and other elements (e.g., carbon, sulfur, or metals) to further optimize the photocatalytic properties and to tailor materials for specific applications."},{"prompt":"ok what doping can reduce tio2 to a +1 state ?","completion":"Doping typically does not fully reduce the oxidation state of titanium in TiO2 down to +1. Conventional doping introduces impurity atoms into the TiO2 lattice, which can affect its electronic structure, electrical conductivity, and light absorption properties without necessarily changing the fundamental oxidation state of the titanium atoms from +4. Creating a Ti^+1 state in a titanium oxide is extremely challenging and highly unusual since such a low oxidation state is generally not stable in an oxide. Titanium(II) oxide (TiO) contains titanium in a +2 state and already exhibits a strong propensity to oxidize to higher oxidation states, such as Ti^+3 in Ti2O3 or Ti^+4 in TiO2, especially in the presence of air. For conventional doping to affect the oxidation state of titanium in TiO2, the dopant atoms would need to bring about significant changes in the titanium-oxygen bonding, effectively removing oxygen atoms from the lattice and creating oxygen vacancies. However, such processes tend to create localized Ti^3+ centers and oxygen vacancies rather than a global reduction to Ti^+1 throughout the material. More aggressive chemical reduction, high-energy particle irradiation, or electrochemical methods might create localized Ti^+2 or possibly Ti^+1 in TiO2, but these states would be transient and not indicative of a stable phase. These lower oxidation states would be highly reactive and would likely revert to more stable states (Ti^+3 or Ti^+4) given the opportunity to interact with oxygen. In summary, doping is not a method that can reduce TiO2 to a +1 oxidation state in a stable or controlled manner. Experimental techniques that can achieve lower oxidation states of titanium in oxide materials are more about creating non-stoichiometric defects or local environments that facilitate specific chemical reactions or physical properties of interest, rather than stabilizing low oxidation states such as +1 over an extended period or across the bulk material."},{"prompt":"so what methods do you suggest to lower its state to +1 or +2 ?","completion":"Lowering the oxidation state of titanium in TiO2 to +1 or +2 requires methods that go beyond conventional doping. These processes typically involve strong reducing conditions that can change the chemistry of the material to create and possibly stabilize these lower oxidation states. Here are some approaches which might be used to achieve a reduced state of titanium in an oxide matrix, although stabilizing Ti^+1 is particularly challenging and not common: 1. **High-Temperature Reduction with Metal**: Heating TiO2 in the presence of a more electropositive metal, such as calcium or magnesium, at high temperatures can reduce the titanium. This process can produce suboxides of titanium where the titanium is in a lower oxidation state (such as TiO with Ti^+2), though controlling the process to target specific oxidation states is complex. 2. **Reduction with Hydrogen**: A high-temperature treatment of titanium oxides in a hydrogen atmosphere can reduce titanium to lower oxidation states. However, maintaining a Ti^+2 state without further reducing to metallic titanium (Ti^0) is difficult, and Ti^+1 is even less likely to be achieved and maintained. 3. **Electrochemical Reduction**: Applying a negative voltage to TiO2 electrodes in an electrochemical cell can generate reduced titanium states. While this may produce surface conditions or transient states with lower oxidation states, under standard conditions, it would be challenging to achieve and stabilize a Ti^+1 oxidation state. 4. **Thermal Decomposition in a Controlled Atmosphere**: Decomposing titanium oxides under carefully controlled partial pressures of oxygen can result in suboxides. Again, the Ti^+2 state can sometimes be obtained, but Ti^+1 is not typically encountered due to its high reactivity. 5. **Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) under Reducing Conditions**: PLD can be used to deposit thin films of titanium oxides with non-stoichiometric compositions, where reduced states may exist due to controlled oxygen deficiencies during the deposition process. 6. **Low-Temperature Solution-Based Methods**: Chemical synthesis in liquid solutions involving strong reducing agents might create nanoparticles or complexes with reduced titanium, but these methods more commonly lead to temporary states rather than stable oxides with Ti^+1 or Ti^+2. It should be noted that achieving a stable Ti^+1 oxidation state in an oxide is particularly challenging and is not typically observed. The Ti^+2 state is more achievable and can be found in compounds like TiO or Ti2O3. However, even in these instances, the titanium is prone to further oxidation to the more stable Ti^+4 state in the presence of oxygen. Additionally, any process used to achieve these reduced states usually results in non-stoichiometric compounds, where the overall compound composition may vary somewhat (e.g., TiO_x with x not precisely equal to 1 or 1.5). Furthermore, the reduced phases of titanium oxide are often not stable in ambient air and require protection from oxygen to maintain their oxidation states. These reduced oxides are typically of interest for specialized applications like conductive ceramics, battery materials, or as precursors for other chemical processes, and they are usually examined and utilized within inert or controlled atmospheres."},{"prompt":"Khẳng định nào sau đây là đúng nhất với trái phiếu.

The ancient Greeks often used the uppercase letter Μ and the lowercase letter remained very similar to its Phoenician ancestor in shape. Later, the Etruscans, who lived in the region that is now modern-day Italy, adopted the Greek alphabet and modified it for their own language. The Romans then borrowed and adapted the Etruscan alphabet to write Latin, which included the \\"m\\" character. Through the Roman script, \\"m\\" found its way into the Latin alphabet, from which it was inherited by many modern writing systems, including the English alphabet. Over the centuries, the shape of the letter \\"m\\" evolved through various styles of Roman and later medieval scripts, such as uncial, Carolingian minuscule, and eventually the printing press. The lowercase \\"m\\" specifically developed a more rounded form as opposed to the sharp angled forms of ancestral scripts. Today, the \\"m\\" continues to be used in the diverse alphabets of many European and other languages influenced by the Latin script. The sound it represents has remained relatively consistent as the bilabial nasal consonant [m], which is produced by closing both lips and allowing air to pass through the nasal cavity."},{"prompt":"What is the origin of the \\"w\\" character in the Latin alphabet?","completion":"The letter \\"w\\" is a relatively late addition to the Latin alphabet and has an interesting origin. It emerged in medieval Europe and can be traced back to the influence of Germanic languages on the Latin script. As the Roman Empire spread, the Latin alphabet was adopted by various peoples who spoke different languages, which sometimes lacked equivalents for Latin sounds and thus, new letters were occasionally created to accommodate those sounds. In the case of the letter \\"w,\\" it originated as a ligature—a combination of two letters—to represent sounds in Germanic languages that were not present in Latin. The \\"w\\" sound is a voiced labiovelar approximant, which is not a sound found in Classical Latin. Germanic languages, however, did have this sound, which was represented by the letter \\"u\\" or \\"v\\" written twice to denote a double \\"u/v\\" sound or a \\"double-u,\\" as \\"w\\" is still called in English. In Latin, \\"u\\" and \\"v\\" were not distinctly separated as in modern languages, and the same character was used for both the vowel sound [u] and the consonant sound [v]. Germanic scribes started using the digraph \\"uu\\" or \\"vv\\" to represent the [w] sound in their own words. Over time, this digraph became more stylized, and the two \\"u\\" or \\"v\\" letters were joined together to form a single character—what we now recognize as \\"w.\\" This evolution likely occurred during the 7th or 8th century. It was first seen in Old English and Old High German manuscripts, where it was used to represent the [w] sound in their respective languages. The \\"w\\" wasn't immediately included when the Latin alphabet was used to write Old English; it only appeared as a distinct letter later on. Until that point, the \\"w\\" sound was written using the runic letter wynn (Ƿ, ƿ), borrowed from the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc runic alphabet. However, as the Roman script became more standardized and the adoption of the Carolingian minuscule writing style spread, the ligature \\"w\\" replaced wynn in English and some other Germanic languages. The letter \\"w\\" is unique to the Germanic languages' use of the Latin alphabet and isn't used natively in other languages like Italian, Latin, or classical Romance languages derived from Latin. It was officially considered a letter in its own right in the English alphabet by the early modern period."},{"prompt":"What is the IPA symbol for the following syllables: - wa - we - wi - wo - wu","completion":"The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) provides symbols to represent the sounds of spoken language. When transcribing the given syllables into IPA symbols, you need to consider both the consonant and the vowel sounds. Here, \\"w\\" corresponds to the voiced labio-velar approximant, represented by the IPA symbol [w]. The vowels correspond to different sounds depending on the language and dialect, but I'll provide a general transcription based on common English pronunciations: - wa: [wɑ] or [wɒ] (depending on whether it's more like the vowel in \\"father\\" (General American) or \\"cot\\" (British Received Pronunciation)) - we: [weɪ] or [wi] (as in \\"way\\" or the sequence [we] in some dialects) - wi: [wi] or [wɪ] (as in \\"we\\" or \\"will\\") - wo: [woʊ] or [wʊ] (as in \\"woe\\" or \\"wood\\"; the former is typically American English, the latter is British English) - wu: [wu] (however, this is not a typical diphthong in English; the pure vowel [u] is close to the \\"oo\\" sound in \\"food\\") Please note that the exact IPA symbols can vary depending on the specific accent or dialect of English you are referring to. Moreover, in other languages, these syllables may have different IPA transcriptions. The vowels in particular can have different qualities in languages other than English."},{"prompt":"How do you write \\"wah hah hoo\\" and \\"wah hah hee\\" in IPA?","completion":"In order to transcribe \\"wah hah hoo\\" and \\"wah hah hee\\" into the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), we need to determine the specific vowel and consonant qualities. These sequences aren't standard words in English, so the transcription will be an approximation based on how they might typically be pronounced in English. For \\"wah hah hoo\\": - \\"wah\\" can be transcribed as [wɑ] or [wɒ], depending on the accent. - \\"hah\\" would likely be transcribed as [hɑ] or [hɒ]. - \\"hoo\\" would typically be [huː]. Combining these, \\"wah hah hoo\\" can be transcribed as [wɑ hɑ huː] or [wɒ hɒ huː]. For \\"wah hah hee\\": - \\"wah\\" as above: [wɑ] or [wɒ]. - \\"hah\\" again as above: [hɑ] or [hɒ]. - \\"hee\\" would typically be [hiː]. Therefore, \\"wah hah hee\\" can be transcribed as [wɑ hɑ hiː] or [wɒ hɒ hiː]. These transcriptions are based on a neutral English accent, so the actual IPA transcription can vary if a different accent or dialect is used.

Que significa esto?","completion":"La presencia de deposiciones poco voluminosas de heces blandas, generalmente inferiores a 200 mL, y diarrea como síntoma predominante puede indicar una condición conocida como diarrea aguda. Esto significa que el intestino delgado y/o grueso está produciendo y eliminando las heces con mayor frecuencia de lo habitual, lo que resulta en una disminución en el tamaño y consistencia de las mismas. Diversas son las causas posibles de la diarrea aguda, entre ellas: 1. Infecciones gastrointestinales: pueden ser causadas por bacterias, virus o parásitos transmitidos a través de alimentos o agua contaminados, contacto directo con personas infectadas o falta de higiene adecuada. Estas infecciones pueden generar inflamación y aumento de la motilidad intestinal, lo que provoca diarrea. 2. Intolerancias o alergias alimentarias: la ingesta de ciertos alimentos o ingredientes a los que una persona es intolerante o alérgica puede causar diarrea como síntoma. Ejemplos comunes son la lactosa (azúcar de la leche) en personas con intolerancia a la lactosa o el gluten en personas con enfermedad celíaca. 3. Medicamentos: algunos medicamentos, como los antibióticos o aquellos que contienen magnesio, pueden provocar diarrea como efecto secundario. 4. Enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales: condiciones como la enfermedad inflamatoria del intestino (colitis ulcerosa o enfermedad de Crohn) pueden causar diarrea crónica o recurrente. 5. Trastornos funcionales del intestino: como el síndrome del intestino irritable, en el cual los movimientos intestinales pueden ser más frecuentes y las heces más blandas. Es importante tener en cuenta que la diarrea aguda puede ser un síntoma de una enfermedad subyacente, por lo que si persiste durante más de unos pocos días o se acompaña de otros síntomas preocupantes como fiebre alta, sangre en las heces, pérdida de peso inexplicada o deshidratación, se debe buscar atención médica para un diagnóstico adecuado y tratamiento específico."},{"prompt":"meteorismo es lo mismo que distension abdominal?","completion":"No, meteorismo y distensión abdominal son conceptos relacionados pero no son exactamente lo mismo. El meteorismo se refiere a la acumulación excesiva de gases en el tracto gastrointestinal, lo que puede provocar síntomas como distensión abdominal, eructos, flatulencia y sensación de llenura. Por otro lado, la distensión abdominal se refiere al aumento del tamaño o volumen del abdomen debido a la acumulación de líquido, gas o tejido en el área. Esto puede ser causado por varias condiciones, como la acumulación excesiva de gas en el tracto gastrointestinal (meteorismo), la retención de líquidos, la obstrucción intestinal, enfermedades hepáticas, enfermedades inflamatorias del intestino, tumores u otras causas. En resumen, el meteorismo es una causa posible de la distensión abdominal, pero no todas las distensiones abdominales son causadas por el meteorismo.

Chicken Little then calls the cops, but Foxy Loxy retaliates by posting an image of Chicken Little on Reddit and ordering it to get downvoted. Her scheme backfires and she and her \\"friends\\" end up getting arrested. Eventually it's revealed that it's all just a dream Chicken Little had","completion":"In the vibrant and bustling town of Oakey Oaks, where the improbable is everyday fare and the sky is always just a stone's throw away (well, if you're Chicken Little, the sky is a bit of a touchy subject), our diminutive hero, \\"Chicken Little\\" Cluck, makes his way to the local Walmart in 2024. It had been nineteen years since the infamous acorn incident, and though the townsfolk no longer doubted his word at every turn, Chicken Little never quite lost his knack for stumbling into the most bizarre situations. Wearing his signature green-striped shirt, his adolescent squeak now a confident cluck, Chicken Little strutted through the automatic sliding doors. Today's mission was simple: procure some premium chicken feed, perhaps with a side of delicious grub worms and corn. The avian aisle awaited, but fate, it seemed, had a different plan in store. As Chicken Little meandered through the produce section, he heard an all-too-familiar giggle. His feathers stood on end—the giggle belonged to none other than Foxy Loxy. Since their school days, Foxy had always been a bit of a wild card, and from the sounds of it, she hadn't changed one bit. Peering around the corner, Chicken Little's beak dropped in astonishment. There was Foxy Loxy, looking audaciously foxy, surrounded by an entourage of slick anthropomorphic foxes. There was the suave and sly Robin Hood from Sherwood Forest, swashbuckling and charismatic; the scientific genius, Mr. Fox, adjusting his spectacles with an air of aloof sophistication; and the cunning and fierce Vixey from the forest, always quick on her feet. Together, they were gathered around the blueberries, filming a TikTok video of their latest shenanigan—an orchestrated blueberry heist. \\"#BlueberryBandits,\\" read the banner that one of them held up, complete with choreographed dance moves and sassy facial expressions. The blueberries disappeared into their bags at an alarming rate, and Chicken Little could hardly believe his eyes. \\"Oh no, no, no. Not on my watch!\\" Chicken Little muttered to himself. He whipped out his flip-phone—vintage nowadays, but reliable—and dialed 911 with the urgency of someone protecting the very sky from falling. \\"Hello, Oakey Oaks Police? This is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. There's a group of foxes stealing blueberries at Walmart. It's a TikTok travesty!\\" The dispatcher assured him that officers were on the way. In the meantime, the blueberry caper continued unabated. Foxy Loxy glanced over and caught sight of Chicken Little on the phone. Her eyes narrowed, and she whispered something to one of her foxy comrades. Before Chicken Little knew it, an image of him—phone to ear and a look of sheer panic on his face—was posted on Reddit with the caption, \\"Chicken Little—the sky isn't falling, but the likes sure are! Downvote to oblivion.\\" Chicken Little's heart sank as he saw the downvotes flood in. But like any good story, there was a twist. The Oakey Oaks community rallied behind Chicken Little. Not only did they upvote the post, but they also added comments praising his bravery and quick thinking. The police arrived on the scene, and Foxy Loxy's plan crumbled like a stale corn muffin. \\"Hands—or paws—up!\\" shouted the arriving officers, and the foxes were handcuffed unceremoniously. The ringleader herself, Foxy Loxy, could only smirk as her latest viral stunt led to a not-so-glamorous mugshot. Just as the officers were escorting the bandits out, Chicken Little woke up with a start. There he was, back in his cozy little nest, a half-eaten corn cob clutched in his wing. \\"What a peculiar dream,\\" he chuckled to himself, the morning sun peeking through his window. \\"Maybe I need to start eating dinner earlier.\\" With a yawn and a stretch, he hopped off his perch, ready to face the day—sky-fallings, blueberry bandits, and all. After all, in Oakey Oaks, anything was possible, but for now, it was time for breakfast. And, perhaps, a trip to Walmart—in the real world."},{"prompt":"Сыграй роль православного священника, а я сыграю роль прихожанина","completion":"Хорошо, давайте начнем. Вы: Здравствуйте, батюшка.

Extracts video clips around those loudest moments and saves them to an output directory.

Define the supported video file extensions. 2. Ask the user to input the maximum number of instants to find and the length of the video segments to extract in seconds. 3. Check if the output folder exists, and if not, create it. 4. Define a function \`scan_videos(directory)\` that returns a list of video files in the specified directory with the supported extensions. 5. Define a function \`find_loudest_moments(audio_segment, num_moments, min_distance_ms)\` that returns the timestamps of the loudest moments in an audio segment. 6. Define a function \`extract_clips(video_path, moments, duration_seconds, output_dir)\` that extracts clips from the video file around the moments provided. 7. Iterate through each video in the current directory, check if it has audio, extract the audio, find the loudest moments, and then extract video clips around those moments. Some additional points to consider: - The temporary audio file used for processing is deleted after extracting the loudest moments. - The \`extract_clips\` function takes care of the boundaries to ensure the video clip is within the duration of the video and the output filename is generated based on the original video name and clip index. - The script provides feedback if a video file does not contain an audio track. - The final message indicates the completion of the clip extraction process. In summary, the script is a fully functional tool to extract video clips based on audio intensity, which can be useful for creating highlights or finding key moments in video footage.

LUDWIG'S OFFICE - WEST GERMAN ARMY BASE - PARANORMAL DIVISION - DUSK The room is extraordinarily neat, with perfectly aligned pens on the desk and not a speck of dust in sight. Shelves with organized files and military memorabilia are illuminated by the golden hues of the setting sun. Ludwig, mid-20s, with his distinct slicked-back blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, stands before the window. He meticulously places large yellow sheets of paper over the glass, ensuring complete coverage. His uniform, pristine and well-fitted, carries the insignia of the West German Army's paranormal division. Satisfied with his privacy, he turns to a corner where a lone violin rests inside an open, velvety case. He picks up the instrument with a practiced grace and slides the bow from its confinement. As he tunes it, his stern expression softens slightly – a glimpse of the passion hidden beneath his usually sarcastic and austere demeanor. With the bow in hand and the violin tucked comfortably under his chin, Ludwig closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and begins to play. The notes fill the office, spilling into the hushed corridors beyond the walls. They are haunting and beautiful, clashing with the image of the young, severe military officer responsible for their creation. A knock on the door.

How... paranormal. Let's not keep the unknown waiting, shall we? He strides towards the door with military precision, casting one last lingering glance at the violin. The yellow paper obstructing the outside view flutters slightly as he passes, the only witnesses to this private concert. His expression is once again all efficiency and authority, the warmth of the music left behind within the now-silent office.

This is the idea that every Disney theatrical animated movie not only shares the same universe but also that, like some sort of fantastical caterpillar becoming a butterfly, the characters and settings morph into those of the next film at the credits' last roll. Let's don our Mickey Mouse ears and explore why this is as ludicrous as a teapot giving life advice. Firstly, imagine the sheer chaos and identity crises that would ensue! Cinderella, basking in the glow of her royal wedding, would suddenly have her glass slippers and ballgown morph into the loincloth and dreadlocks of Tarzan. One moment she's learning the delicate art of royal diplomacy, and the next she's swinging on vines and communicating with gorillas. The castle staff, you ask? Why, they'd turn into a cadre of jungle animals! Imagine the King, adjusting his crown, only to find he's now a silverback gorilla wondering why he's holding a scepter instead of a banana. Then take Scar from \\"The Lion King,\\" who was quite content with his villainous life on the sun-scorched savannas of Africa. Picture his surprise when suddenly he's transformed into Frollo from \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\\" and instead of prowling around Pride Rock, he's slinking through the dark corridors of Notre Dame cathedral, confusedly singing 'Be Prepared' to a crowd of bewildered Parisians. How about the logistics of architecture and geography? One day you have the icy spires of Arendelle in \\"Frozen,\\" and the next day it's all gone. Instead, a vast ocean rolls out to welcome \\"Moana.\\" The poor citizens of Arendelle wake up from their warm beds only to find themselves floating on rafts, while Olaf melts into a coconut-flavored smoothie under the tropical sun. And let's not forget Aladdin's Agrabah transforming into the American Old West of \\"Home on the Range.\\" Jasmine exchanges her tiger Rajah for a herd of cattle, while the genie is now trapped inside a harmonica instead of a lamp, leaving Aladdin to wonder why his flying carpet has suddenly sprouted horns and is chewing cud. Time periods and historical accuracy? Throw them out the window! We'd have the Huns from \\"Mulan\\" running into armies of stormtroopers from \\"Star Wars\\" because, why not? It's all the same galactic Disneyverse, isn't it? Next thing you know, Darth Vader is having a tea party with Alice in Wonderland, and Yoda is offering cryptic advice to Simba. And how would they handle the soundtrack? One can only assume there'd be an eclectic jukebox in the sky, eternally shuffling between \\"Let It Go\\" and \\"Hakuna Matata,\\" with the occasional \\"Under the Sea\\" to keep the marine life peppy. In short, while it's enchanting to think of all Disney animated movies as different chapters of the same story, the notion is as hilariously absurd as Goofy performing heart surgery. The beautiful chaos that would arise from such a crossover of characters, settings, and narratives is best left to the infinite realm of fan fiction, where it can be cherished without the unenviable task of explaining how Pocahontas suddenly became an extraterrestrial bounty hunter in \\"Lilo & Stitch.\\""},{"prompt":"Write an anime scene about a military officer playing violin in his office.

LUDWIG'S OFFICE – WEST BERLIN MILITARY DIVISION HQ – NIGHT (1963) The office is pristine, every piece of furniture perfectly aligned, every book equally spaced on the bookshelf. The eerie quiet of the night is punctuated only by the hushed footsteps of military personnel outside the thick, wooden door. A dim lamp casts a soft glow across the room, highlighting clean, polished surfaces and the numerous awards and medals adorning the walls. LUDWIG, a handsome young military officer with slicked-back blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, dressed immaculately in his uniform, stands by the window. His expression is stern, an air of intensity exuding from his sharp, sarcastic tongue should anyone dare to interrupt his meticulously scheduled routine. Methodically, Ludwig smoothes out large yellow sheets of paper, adhering them to the interior of the windowpanes. He ensures that the seals are tight — not a sliver of light can betray his clandestine activity to the outside world. Satisfied with his work, he turns sharply on his heel and strides across the room to a sturdy, antique violin case resting on his desk. With the care of a surgeon, he opens the case and withdraws a beautifully crafted violin and bow, the wood gleaming under the lamp light. Closing his eyes, Ludwig positions the violin under his chin. The stern exterior momentarily softens as his fingers caress the strings, finding their positions with practiced ease. Then, with a swift motion, he brings the bow down, and the violin roars to life. The notes are electric, fierce, and he plays with the fervor of a metal guitarist lost in a shredding solo. The melody, while classically structured, exudes the raw, aggressive energy of a rock ballad, echoing the covert intensity of the paranormal investigations his division undertakes. Ludwig's expression is one of pure focus, his blue eyes burning with the fire of creation. His movements are sharp and precise, each stroke of the bow a strike against the invisible enemies that lurk in the shadows of West Berlin. As he reaches the crescendo, the music vibrates through the walls, books on the shelves rattling softly. The sound surely seeps through into the adjacent corridors of the bizarre university-museum facade that conceals their true operations. For a moment, Ludwig is not only a soldier in the West German Army's special paranormal division; he is a maestro commanding an invisible orchestra, battling forces beyond the comprehension of ordinary men. But as the final note shivers into silence, Ludwig lowers his violin. His stern expression returns. He looks around the room, ensuring everything is as it should be — undisturbed, orderly, secure. He returns the violin to its case, removes the yellow paper, and smooths back a stray lock of blonde hair. His office, once a stage for an impassioned concert, returns to its original state: the sanctuary of a soldier who demands perfection in a world dancing on the edge of the supernatural. Just as the clock ticks midnight, Ludwig sits back down at his desk, his posture rigid, the music a ghost in the air as he resumes the never-ending paperwork — each stroke of the pen as meticulous as the notes from his violin.

Milo and Kida, exploring the new world, accidentally trigger an ancient device that converts the entire population into monsters. **2001: \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"** Sulley and Mike now run a successful scare business until Boo's laughter sends a shockwave of energy, mutating everyone into animals with deeply entrenched wildlife politics. **2003: \\"Brother Bear\\"** The bears and moose enjoy their tranquil life until an aurora borealis transforms the whole setting into a colorful ocean bursting with underwater antics. **2003: \\"Finding Nemo\\"** Marlin and Nemo's adventure under the sea leads to a volcanic eruption that splashes magic water on land, creating a superhero city. **2004: \\"The Incredibles\\"** After Syndrome's defeat, Edna Mode designs a super-suit that’s too super, causing a reality-bending fashion show that turns everyone into sentient vehicles. **2006: \\"Cars\\"** The Cars race around the globe so fast, they hit 88 mph, breaking the time-space continuum and reverting the world back to the prehistoric age. **2006: \\"Meet the Robinsons\\"** A dinosaur from the previous era stumbles into Lewis's time machine, accidentally setting the time to medieval Scotland, with everyone now a clan member or beast. **2012: \\"Brave\\"** Merida's refusal to get married creates such a strong feminist energy that it zaps everyone into becoming video game characters in an arcade. **2012: \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\"** Ralph's game-hopping shenanigans lead to the unplugging of the arcade, which sucks everyone into a cybernautical world of candy racing. **2013: \\"Frozen\\"** Elsa's ice powers reach critical mass, flash-freezing the candy landscape into a Scandinavian kingdom threatened by eternal winter. **2013: \\"Frozen II\\"** The enchanted forest from Frozen II awakens ancient spirits who dance too vigorously to \\"Into the Unknown,\\" causing the earth to shake and transform into a big-city backdrop with mind-bending dimensions. **2016: \\"Zootopia\\"** Zootopia's city thrives until an experimental carrot serum goes haywire, turning all mammals into spunky Polynesian demigods and their sidekicks. **2016: \\"Moana\\"** Moana's successful restoration of Te Fiti's heart overfertilizes the ocean, sprouting a lush island where techno-dogs rule and everyone is obsessed with a virtual city-building game. **2018: \\"Ralph Breaks the Internet\\"** Ralph’s internet-breaking antics ultimately crash the game, causing the canines to fuse into plush-toy bodies, bringing us to... **2021: \\"Raya and the Last Dragon\\"** And in the ultimate twist of fate, traditional plush-toy battles lead to the boiling tensions between the land of Kumandra and Talon, which somehow alchemize into a world of anthropomorphic jazz-loving cats... **2020: \\"Soul\\"** ...and thus, the cycle continues, with everyone waiting to see what mystical, inexplicable transformations await as jazz music infiltrates the very fabric of reality, undoubtedly setting the stage for Disney's next surprising evolution! As you can see, this hilariously nonsensical timeline should in no way be considered an accurate interpretation of Disney lore. Instead, it should serve as a testament to the boundless creativity and humor that Disney animated movies inspire in all of us!"},{"prompt":"Write an anime scene about a military officer playing violin in his office. He places big yellow sheets of paper on his office's windows so nobody sees him. His name is Ludwig. He has slicked back blonde hair and blue eyes. He is young. He is stern, sarcastic and a neat freak. He puts away his peaked cap. He is part of a special division of the West German Army that deals with the paranormal. He plays the violin like he is playing death metal. The setting is in 1963 in the division's HQ which is in West Berlin, cleverly disguised as a odd mix of a university and museum.","completion":"INT. WEST BERLIN DIVISION HQ - LUDWIG'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON (1963) The camera pans across a meticulously organized office, blending military austerity with the dusty curiosity of a university professor. The walls, lined with bookshelves brimming with tomes on the occult and the paranormal, stand in stark contrast to the neatly aligned awards and military commendations. The setting sun casts a haunting glow into the room, intercepted by thick yellow sheets of paper covering each window, serving both as blinds and a shield to curious onlookers. Behind a polished mahogany desk, we find LUDWIG (mid-20s), his slicked-back blonde hair and piercing blue eyes exuding an air of authority beyond his years. His clean uniform bears the insignia of the West German Army's special paranormal division. Ludwig's stern face softens briefly as he gingerly places his peaked cap on the desk, next to a stack of papers outlining the latest unexplained phenomena. His fingers delicately undo his jacket buttons, allowing himself just a fraction more freedom of movement. Despite his stern and sarcastic demeanor, his rigid posture relaxes as he turns his attention to a sleek, dark violin case nestled in the shadows. Cut to a close-up of Ludwig's hands as they open the case, revealing the violin and bow within. The instrument seems almost out of place in this world of military precision and scholarly research—a sliver of artistic whimsy among the sternness. His fingers trace the strings before he takes the violin and bow into his grasp, bringing them up to playing position with the precision of a drill sergeant. Then, with a ferocity matched only by the death metal he mimics in style, Ludwig's bow rips across the strings. Music erupts in the room, relentless and fierce. It's a jarring melody, marked by aggressive staccatos and blistering, discordant scales that reverberate through the stacks of paranormal literature. The camera pulls back, circling Ludwig as he sways to the frenetic tune, each note a deliberate affront to the silent history of the room. Despite the chaos in his performance, his face remains expressionless, a neat freak in control of the tumultuous sounds he creates. Lamp light flickers and casts sharp shadows as if the ghosts of the past are aroused by the performance. As the piece reaches its climax, a knock at the door jolts Ludwig into silence. He freezes, his bow mere millimeters from the strings. VOICE (O.S.) (officer, muffled through the door) Major Ludwig, sir, are you ready for the briefing? Ludwig's piercing gaze moves towards the door, and in a flash, he's the immaculate military officer once more. He sets the violin back into its case with a care that borders on reverence before responding with biting sarcasm, masking the breach of his personal world. LUDWIG (putting on his stern facade) I'm always ready, Lieutenant. Unlike some, I don't dawdle with the living when the dead march at our doorstep. The mixture of fear and curiosity is palpable as the unseen lieutenant retreats. A smirk tugs at the corner of Ludwig's mouth—a rare moment of victory against the regimented world he's well-versed in navigating. As Ludwig rebutton his jacket, the scene fades to black, the faint echo of an otherworldly violin lingering in the air—music or madness, only the walls of the faux university-museum could tell. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

WEST BERLIN MILITARY OFFICE - DAY - 1963 The scene opens with a close-up of LUDWIG's fingers deftly loosening his military belt, the clinking sound of the metal buckle echoing through the office. The office is meticulous, every file and pen in perfect order, reflecting LUDWIG's disciplined nature. As he removes his peaked cap, the camera zooms out to show his sharp uniform, the insignia of the West German Army's special paranormal division embellished on it. A hint of a smirk plays across LUDWIG's stern, chiseled face as he opens an old, worn suitcase—hidden beneath a false bottom, a gleaming violin and bow lay in wait. Deftly, he picks them up, examines them for a moment, and begins to play. The music is intense, not the classical pieces one would expect, but with a fervor and aggression that could match the wildest death metal bands. LUDWIG's slicked-back blonde hair sways slightly as he jerks his head to the rhythm he creates, his blue eyes burning with a fierce concentration and passion that he hides from the world. Before he begins, LUDWIG purposefully strides over to the windows of his office. He sticks large, yellow sheets of paper onto each pane, ensuring no prying eyes can witness this secret indulgence. It is a window into his soul that he is not comfortable sharing, even in this eerie building that masquerades as part university, part museum, with its dark secrets lurking in the shadows. Just as LUDWIG becomes utterly consumed by his performance, the door flies open. One of his colleagues, CORPORAL BAUMANN, storms in—just in time to catch a glimpse of the surreal scene. The MUSIC STOPS abruptly. The camera switches to BAUMANN's point of view as he freezes, taking in the sight of this imposing officer in a rare state of abandon. There's a beat of silence, the tension almost visible in the air. CORPORAL BAUMANN (Wide-eyed) Okay, nevermind... BAUMANN awkwardly retreats, closing the door behind him with a soft click. The moment he's gone, an amused smirk tugs at LUDWIG's lips, and with a dismissive roll of his eyes, he resumes his intense, furious playing, all alone in his office once again. The camera pans out, the yellow window sheets casting a warm, golden light over LUDWIG as he loses himself in the music. The MUSIC FADES into the background as we cut to the bustling streets of West Berlin, the peculiar building standing innocuously among them, a haven of paranormal mysteries shielded from the rest of the world. Ludwig's savage violin solo morphs into the hubbub of the city, blending the abnormal with the mundane, a reminder that secrets and wonders lurk just beneath the facade of everyday life."},{"prompt":"[Response must be in short form.] Could a (former) star fortress be a 15 minute city?","completion":"Yes, if repurposed efficiently to include amenities like housing, offices, shops, schools, parks, and healthcare, all within a 15-minute walk or bike ride."},{"prompt":"Write an anime scene about a military officer playing violin in his office.

LUDWIG'S OFFICE – WEST BERLIN – AFTERNOON The camera slowly moves through a sterile but meticulously organized military office within the West German Army's special division headquarters, a place where the line between academic pursuit and military discipline blurs. The walls are adorned with maps and paranormal artifacts, and bookshelves crammed with leather-bound research. At the heart of the space, CAPTAIN LUDWIG, a young officer with slicked-back blonde hair, piercing blue eyes, and an immaculate uniform, is involved in a clandestine operation. He stands by his window, applying large yellow sheets of paper to the glass, ensuring that no prying eyes can observe his actions. There is an air of ritual to his movements, a prelude to something deeply personal. CUT TO: Ludwig opens a nondescript briefcase, revealing a beautifully crafted violin and bow. The case's velvet interior contrasts with the weapon-like efficiency of its hidden compartment. Ludwig carefully takes out the violin, his stern face softening for a moment with a reverence for the instrument. He positions the violin under his chin, takes a breath, and then... His bow strikes the strings with the ferocity of a man possessed. The music is not what one expects from a classical instrument. It's wild, vigorous, imbued with the spirit of death metal rather than the usual baroque or classical melodies associated with the violin. Ludwig's face contorts with the intense concentration and passion of his play, his body swaying with the sheer force of the music. SUDDENLY, the door bursts open. SARGEANT RENFIELD, the British vampire colleague, pokes his head into the room. He's taken aback by the sight – Ludwig, so composed in his military capacity, now lost in a frenzy of strings and wood. Renfield's eyes widen, a humorous glint to them as he takes in the spectacle of the young officer rocking out. RENFIELD Oi, Ludwig, I -- But he stops, realizing the sanctity of this private moment. Renfield gives a brief, affable smirk and nods in silent understanding. RENFIELD (whispers to himself) Okay, nevermind. The door quietly shuts, and Renfield is already gone, as silently as a shadow fades with the shifting of light. Ludwig, for a brief moment, pauses, ensuring his privacy is intact. A flicker of irritation crosses his stern features, quickly fading back into his stoic mask. Confirming his solitude, he resumes his passionate play, now more fervently than before, the bow dancing madly over the strings, the notes climbing in a crescendo. FADE OUT: As the screen darkens and the music reaches a climax, we understand that this office, this division, and Captain Ludwig himself are not merely what they seem to be. In a world of paranormal secrets, Ludwig's violin is both an escape and an echo of the chaos they face daily, beautifully captured in its haunting, wild melody.

Here are a few hypothetical concepts that science fiction, philosophy, and speculative science might suggest: 1. **Multiverse**: Beyond the boundaries of our universe could lie an immense expanse containing many other universes, each with their own distinct laws of physics and constants. This 'multiverse' could potentially have an infinite number of universes. 2. **Higher-Dimensional Space**: Our universe could be a 'brane' floating in a larger, higher-dimensional space ('bulk'). Entities or forces existing in this higher-dimensional realm might be able to interact with our universe in ways that would seem supernatural to us. 3. **Quantum Foam**: At the very edge, there could be a chaotic 'foam' where space-time breaks down into a bubbly quantum state, and the classical laws of physics no longer apply. 4. **Cosmic Ocean**: Drawing on ancient mythological concepts, beyond the universe might be a vast, timeless ocean or ether, within which our universe and perhaps others float like bubbles or islands. 5. **Parent Universe**: Our universe could be the result of a 'white hole' or an offshoot from another older universe. Beyond its boundaries might be the remnants or continuation of this parent universe. 6. **The Loop**: The finite universe might loop back on itself, so venturing beyond its 'edge' could paradoxically bring you back into the universe from another location—similar to the idea of a globe where traveling in one direction eventually leads back to your starting point. 7. **Void and Nothingness**: Beyond the boundaries of our universe might be an absolute void, a nothingness devoid of space, time, matter, energy, and the physical laws, a concept that's difficult to fathom given that 'nothing' is innately undefinable and inherently unstable in quantum theories. 8. **The Cosmic Forest**: Just as trees in a forest are separate but part of a larger ecosystem, our universe might be one of many 'cosmic trees' in a vast 'cosmic forest', with its own life cycle and interactions independent of our universe. 9. **Alien Constructs**: Our entire universe could be within an artificial construct created by vastly superior beings or an advanced civilization, akin to a cosmic terrarium or a simulation. 10. **The Infinite Loop**: Similar to the video game concept of \\"screen wrapping,\\" where moving off one side of the screen causes you to appear on the other side, the boundary of the universe could lead to a direct entrance back into our universe, creating a loop. These concepts are, of course, purely speculative and often more within the realm of science fiction or metaphysics than empirical science. Given that there's currently no evidence suggesting that the universe is indeed finite or that an \\"edge\\" exists, these musings remain in the territory of imaginative thought experiments."},{"prompt":"What about a list of hypothetical higher dimensions? Does time and space go on infinitely or is there a final dimension that contains all others?","completion":"The concept of higher dimensions extends beyond our familiar three-dimensional space and the dimension of time (often referred to as spacetime in four-dimensional terms). In physics and mathematics, higher dimensions are used to construct theories to explain natural phenomena and abstract mathematical spaces. However, there is no established scientific consensus on the existence or nature of these dimensions beyond those established in empirically supported theories. Let's delve into some hypothetical higher dimensions, keeping in mind that these are speculative: 1. **Fifth Dimension**: In some theories, such as certain variants of string theory, the fifth dimension is a spatial dimension added to our four-dimensional spacetime continuum. This could allow for movement through multiple, parallel versions of our universe or different initial conditions. 2. **Sixth Dimension**: This dimension might allow navigation between possible worlds or universes that start with the same initial conditions (the Big Bang, for instance) but where history has played out differently (due to different subsequent events). 3. **Seventh Dimension**: A universe in the seventh dimension would encompass all possible worlds with different start conditions and all the possible histories of those universes, essentially a space of infinite possibilities. 4. **Eighth Dimension**: A realm that might contain all possible universes with all possible laws of physics. This is further abstraction because it allows for the variation of the very fundamentals which govern the universes. 5. **Ninth Dimension**: Using this dimension, you could compare and contrast all the possible universes that start with all the different possible laws of physics and initial conditions. 6. **Tenth Dimension**: Often represented as the final dimension in some models of string theory, the tenth dimension could be the point where everything is possible and imaginable. It represents the idea of infinite possibilities and contains the entire space of which all the other dimensions are facets. 7. **Beyond the Tenth Dimension**: Whether there are any dimensions beyond the tenth is purely speculative and not grounded in any current scientific or mathematical theory. The idea enters the realm of philosophy and metaphysical conjecture. It may hypothetically represent levels of existence or consciousness that are simply beyond human comprehension. In these higher-dimensional scenarios, time and space as we understand them could either extend infinitely, with each higher dimension encompassing a vastly more complex realm of possibilities, or they could loop back onto themselves in some higher-dimensional analog to a closed surface (imagine a higher-dimensional sphere). Alternatively, there may be a final dimension, as in some interpretations of string theory, which is so all-encompassing that it contains all other dimensions and all possible iterations of reality. It's important to note that these higher dimensions are largely theoretical and are not observable or measurable in any practical sense. They are useful constructs in certain advanced mathematical models and theoretical physics constructs, particularly in areas like string theory, M-theory, and various unification theories. In these theoretical frameworks, dimensions beyond time and the three spatial dimensions are not \\"places\\" one could go but rather additional degrees of freedom that particles can move in at the most fundamental levels. The nature of time and space, whether finite or infinite, and the existence of a final dimension that contains all others are profound mysteries. These remain open questions for physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers, inviting ongoing exploration and debate."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, \\"Picket Fences\\" is a television series that aired in the 1990s, and without further context, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact origin or usage of this phrase within the show. \\"Picket Fences\\" was known for its quirky, sometimes surreal storylines, often blending drama with comedy in the small town of Rome, Wisconsin. If the phrase comes from an episode of the show, it could reference a moment of lighthearted decision-making or a metaphorical choice between fun, technology, and personal relationships. Since this phrase does not appear to be a famous or widely recognized quote from \\"Picket Fences,\\" it might come from a specific scene or episode that is less well-known. If you can provide additional context or clarify that the term \\"Pickett Fences\\" refers to something other than the television series, I might be able to offer a more specific answer."},{"prompt":"Season 1 Episode 14: Bad Moons Rising","completion":"\\"Bad Moons Rising\\" is the 14th episode of the first season of \\"Picket Fences,\\" which aired in the early 1990s. The show was created by David E. Kelley and depicted life in the small town of Rome, Wisconsin. It was known for combining legal and police drama with quirky, offbeat situations. In this specific episode, it's possible that the phrase \\"chocolate cake, Gameboy or me\\" could be part of a character's dialogue or a dilemma presented to a character, possibly reflecting a decision between indulgence (chocolate cake), entertainment (Gameboy), and personal relationship (me). Since plot summaries for specific episodes of older TV series can be limited online, I don't have access to a detailed script or information about that particular phrase in context. To understand the meaning and significance of the phrase within the episode, one might need to watch it or find a transcript of \\"Bad Moons Rising.\\" The episode might center around a subplot where a character is faced with that whimsical choice, reflecting themes of temptation, entertainment, and personal connection, all of which could align with the show's blend of humor and drama. If you are interested in the specifics of that episode and the context in which the phrase is used, you might consider watching the episode or checking out comprehensive episode guides or fan forums, where fans of the show may discuss plot details and memorable lines."},{"prompt":"Write a list of 12 pop cultural things that came out in 2004, and for each pop cultural thing, a short description of it","completion":"1. **Music Album: \\"Confessions\\" by Usher** - This R&B album included hits like \\"Yeah!\\" featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris, and \\"Burn.\\" It became one of the best-selling albums of the year and solidified Usher's status as a leading artist of the time. 2. **Movie: \\"Mean Girls\\"** - A teen comedy film written by Tina Fey and starring Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, and Amanda Seyfried.

These cities are most famously condemned in the Book of Genesis, primarily in chapters 18 and 19. Throughout the text, the specific sins of these cities are not exhaustively detailed, but several points are made clear through the narrative and later prophetic references: 1. Lack of hospitality and aggression toward strangers: In Genesis 19, two angels visit Lot in the city of Sodom, and the men of Sodom demand to have sexual relations with them. Lot offers his daughters to protect his guests, highlighting the extreme violation of codes of hospitality toward strangers, which was a grave offense in the ancient Near East. 2. Sexual immorality: The demand by the Sodomites to \\"know\\" the visitors (Genesis 19:5) has been traditionally interpreted by some as a reference to homosexual acts, contributing to the understanding that sexual immorality, including homosexual behavior, was a central sin of the cities. 3. Widespread wickedness and sin: In Genesis 18:20, the Lord says, \\"The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous,\\" which indicates a broader context of sinfulness rather than a single specific offense. 4. Lack of justice and righteousness: The prophets Isaiah (Isaiah 1:10, 3:9), Jeremiah (Jeremiah 23:14), Ezekiel (Ezekiel 16:49-50), and Amos (Amos 4:11) provide further insight into the sins of these cities, indicating a culture of pride, complacency, exploitation of the poor and needy, arrogance, and a lack of concern for the disadvantaged. Ezekiel 16:49-50 specifically states: \\"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen.\\" In summary, while the Tanakh alludes to various immoral behaviors and injustices as the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah, it also emphasizes their failure to practice hospitality and compassion, as well as their arrogance and disregard for the vulnerable in society."},{"prompt":"阅读下面的评论，总结大家对当前股票的评价，条数不超过15条；并总结；如果有有用的信息，请告诉我： 评论内容 评论时间 经营状况不佳，跑吧 2024-01-07 09:42:35 周一跌停了吧要 2024-01-06 11:47:52 公司员工人心散了，周一大跌 2024-01-07 08:56:00 大雪压青松，青松挺且直，要知松高洁，待到雪化时。陈毅 2024-01-07 08:33:19 广联达最大的风险就是持续亏损 2024-01-07 08:31:36 互联网是强大的，听说顶不住压力了，说收回前面的决定，变为管理层零绩效，大家能信吗 2024-01-07 08:08:47 我是广联达的前员工，9月刚被裁了，可以这么讲，广联达这家公司毫无人性可言，为了让 2024-01-07 08:04:44 年终奖不发，什么玩意公司 2024-01-06 21:22:43 良心公司，为了广大股东利益，不发年终奖，这样省的10亿算作今年的利润，业绩大增， 2024-01-06 22:04:31 靠裁员，和不发绩效改善财报公司的股票你敢买？是打算抄底吗？你确定是底吗 2024-01-05 21:49:05 公司业绩并没有亏损甚至盈利，猜猜为啥不发年终奖？因为要凑够12亿利润呀；为啥要凑 2024-01-07 01:02:38 广联达要涨了，扣了全体员工的年终奖，这不就是公司的利润么，营收长不上去了，可以这 2024-01-05 20:45:46 该跑跑吧 2024-01-06 20:04:02 卖不完，根本卖不完。恨不得把公司全卖给散户[龙头] 2024-01-06 21:17:46 想问问贵公司，全体员工年度绩效不发，引起全员不满，想必员工信心和工作热情都会备受 2024-01-06 11:05:44 亏了百分之五十了准备放弃了，收拾心情准备过年，以后都不来大A了！ 2024-01-05 22:58:32 有人持有这个股票吗，观察了半年这是自选股第一个腰斩的股票，还好当初没买，这公司出 2024-01-06 19:42:37 绩效打折，以后工作时间打折，给客户交付打折 2024-01-06 19:23:29 31块76的本这几年怕解套不了 2024-01-06 16:27:31 身为员工说一句现状，年终归0。现在要么是准备跳槽的，要么是准点下班的。1天做完的 2024-01-05 19:26:59 今年年报有戏，广联达几个亿的年终奖不发，导致利润增加了一些~~~大家再坚持坚持 2024-01-06 08:13:45 广联达(SZ002410) 2024-01-06 12:45:53 纠正一下各位投资者，被克扣的不是年终奖，是年终绩效，全员绩效全部为0，是违法行为 2024-01-05 11:36:15 完了，年终奖发不起了 2024-01-06 09:04:13 广联达日赚10亿！还有比它赚钱更快的公司吗！ 2024-01-06 10:57:43 这些空头太无聊了 2024-01-05 20:35:53 有股票的快跑吧！去年年终奖打折，今年清0，作为小散户还有什么期待，业绩(呵呵)， 2024-01-05 14:50:32 大聪明领导想了个赚钱的好方法，不发工资了 2024-01-05 23:57:59 月线看怎么也得破一下14才有机会买，现在大盘不稳，已经买的躺平等着，能补仓的还是 2024-01-05 23:02:21 听说全员没年终奖了，你可以涨了吧 2024-01-05 11:21:34 靠裁员和全员年度绩效工资清零来回购的股票你们还敢买吗？早卖早脱身。 2024-01-05 21:58:56 21.7的本钱，今年能回来么[哭] 2024-01-05 18:37:51 周一吃大面 2024-01-05 21:11:11 这只股可以抄底了，公司首先裁员20%降本增效，其次牺牲全体员工年终奖粉饰财报，净 2024-01-05 20:45:41 又要走几连阴？ 2024-01-05 20:28:33 12 2024-01-05 19:14:06 下周目标价15元 2023-12-15 15:38:04 早盘被诱多的周一又得割肉了 2024-01-05 17:01:42 今儿能不能破15？ 2024-01-05 09:19:11 完，一个集团的年终奖进去拉，就弄成这个样子 2024-01-05 17:20:29 员工年终奖都在传不发了，黑啊 2024-01-05 11:01:36 好消息，广联达明天、后天止跌平稳！ 2024-01-05 15:59:23 自从买了广联达，收益率直线下滑 2024-01-05 15:13:35 冲吧冲吧，抄底 2024-01-05 16:16:07 到底了，抄 2024-01-05 10:28:58 21块时明明清掉了，心疼5万，想想又买回，肠子悔青了！！ 2024-01-05 10:09:40 15.8进来了，四个月的等待[得意][得意][得意]广联达必不负我[牛][牛][ 2024-01-04 14:18:54 广联达如果是港股，股价应该到0.15元港币。但它A股，价格可净资产贴20%，股价 2024-01-04 16:52:56 给老子冲，亏了百分九十了 2024-01-05 10:59:20 广联达股价连续3日创近5年新低 2024-01-05 15:51:51 成本19.4，先不补，还要跌，心里价位14.8在开始 2024-01-05 11:37:44 数据要素概念股。今天是不是要大涨 2024-01-05 09:10:33 大哥们的成本多少啊？我18.13元4600股，已经满舱了，怎么办啊，求求各位大哥 2024-01-04 11:38:58 师姐18.3已建仓广联达 2023-10-30 17:23:40 马上绿了 2024-01-05 14:03:50 跌的没有一点底线了吗？这不是垄断软件吗，就算地产不用，基建，工程建筑都不用了？至 2024-01-04 15:18:15 这玩意会不会和仁东控股一样，往S整 2024-01-05 13:59:02 ，老子一割肉你就涨？？？ 2024-01-05 10:31:11 拉个涨停看看。怕啥？ 2024-01-05 10:01:58 全网.想无，涨了又跌，跌了又跌 2024-01-05 14:39:04 跌的比大盘还少些，你们就知足吧！ 2024-01-05 14:31:35 砸盘的咋还羞涩了？ 2024-01-05 13:24:35 年终绩效奖都不发，这是员工本身应得的，整个集团都不发，就这股票还想涨，10块以下 2024-01-05 12:22:46 公司高层心思早就远离经营了 2024-01-05 13:58:30 广联达(SZ002410) 2024-01-05 10:33:09 没有5个以上的放量涨幅也叫涨，这一个点就出来一群牛鬼蛇神，也不看看它跌的时候每天 2024-01-05 10:53:07 大盘翻绿，广联达立马下跌到15.80元以下[微笑] 2024-01-05 10:15:07 必绿装成一树高，万条垂下绿丝绦，不知空头谁在做，大A收割似镰刀 2024-01-05 10:20:02 17.5的本，大哥你什么时候让我回本，我再也不玩了 2024-01-05 09:47:37 涨一点，这些货们就使劲的砸 2024-01-05 10:07:45 这主力要出一波回家过年了？ 2024-01-05 10:02:02 分析一波，，， 2024-01-05 09:59:57 又套一波 2024-01-05 09:58:01 10元以内才是你的归宿。。 2024-01-05 09:22:12 造了什么孽呀，苍天呀！！ 2024-01-05 09:24:03 得把散户折磨吐血 2024-01-05 09:27:20 广联达：连续6日融资净买入累计4202.67万元（01-04） 2024-01-05 09:18:00 17.27会拉回去的，一阳穿6阴实顶 2024-01-05 05:07:49 商誉竟然占净资产的四分之一，十多亿的商誉是怎么形成的？如果提取将会是什么结果？ 2024-01-05 07:34:38 看脉脉上说所有员工23年绩效清零？全员没有年终奖？对外面散户挺狠，对自己员工也挺 2024-01-04 22:59:01","completion":"1. 经营状况不佳，跑吧 2. 周一跌停了吧要 3. 公司员工人心散了，周一大跌 4. 广联达最大的风险就是持续亏损 5. 互联网是强大的，听说顶不住压力了，说收回前面的决定，变为管理层零绩效 6. 今年年报有戏，广联达几个亿的年终奖不发，导致利润增加了一些 7. 靠裁员和不发绩效改善财报公司的股票你敢买？是打算抄底吗？你确定是底吗 8. 有股票的快跑吧！去年年终奖打折，今年清0，作为小散户还有什么期待，业绩(呵呵) 9. 21.7的本这几年怕解套不了 10. 全体员工年度绩效不发，引起全员不满，想必员工信心和工作热情都会备受 11. 广联达日赚10亿！还有比它赚钱更快的公司吗！ 12. 自从买了广联达，收益率直线下滑 13. 该跑跑吧 14. 有人持有这个股票吗，观察了半年这是自选股第一个腰斩的股票，还好当初没买 15. 亏了百分之五十了准备放弃了，收拾心情准备过年，以后都不来大A了！ 大家对当前股票的评价普遍不佳，认为公司经营状况不佳，亏损严重。有人指出公司利用裁员和不发绩效来改善财报，引起了员工和投资者的不满。人们对公司的未来不抱有希望，许多人打算卖出股票并离开大A市场。这些评论中有用的信息是公司亏损严重、裁员和不发绩效来掩盖财报等问题。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Фильмы с более высоким рейтингом, такие как R (Restricted) или NC-17, могут включать матерные слова, тогда как фильмы с рейтингом PG или PG-13 будут ограничивать или исключать их использование. 2. **Жанр и стиль:** В некоторых жанрах, таких как криминальные драмы или фильмы для взрослой аудитории, нецензурная лексика может быть более часто используемой, чтобы отразить реалистичность уличного языка или особенностей персонажа. 3. **Художественное значение:** В некоторых случаях матерные слова используются для придания особого эмоционального оттенка диалогу или для развития персонажа. 4. **Правовые ограничения:** В зависимости от страны, могут существовать различные законы и регуляции, касающиеся выражений, допустимых в общественном вещании или кинопроизведениях. 5. **Аудитория:** Целевая аудитория также играет большую роль в определении допустимости матов в диалогах. Произведения, ориентированные на детей и семьи, будут стремиться избегать нецензурной лексики. 6. **Платформы и дистрибьюторы:** Конкретные платформы или дистрибьюторы могут иметь свои собственные стандарты и практики относительно нецензурной лексики в содержании, которое они распространяют. 7. **Социокультурные различия:** Разные культуры могут различаться в своем отношении к использованию матов в публичном контенте. В некоторых странах это может быть строго запрещено, в то время как в других это может рассматриваться как менее значительное нарушение. Сценарист должен тщательно обдумывать решение о включении матов в диалоги, учитывая вышеуказанные факторы и возможные последствия для работы. При этом следует помнить о том, что создание сценария — это творческий процесс, и его цель в конечном счете заключается в передаче определенной истории с использованием языковых и художественных средств, которые кажутся наиболее подходящими для достижения поставленных целей."},{"prompt":"абзац ремарка в сценарии отступы какие?","completion":"Форматирование сценария является важным аспектом сценарного искусства и строго регламентировано. Как правило, сценарии используют стандартизированный шрифт Courier 12 pt, поскольку это моноширинный шрифт, где каждый символ занимает одинаковое пространство, что позволяет легко оценить продолжительность фильма по длине сценария. Ремарка (или \\"действие\\") обычно начинается слева от поля и делается с левым выравниванием текста. Стандартные отступы для сценария следующие: - Левое поле: 1,5 дюйма (3,81 см) - Правое поле: 1 дюйм (около 2,54 см) - Верхнее и нижнее поля: от 1 до 1,25 дюйма (около 2,54 до 3,18 см) Ремарка обычно начинается на отступе в 1,5 дюйма от левого края страницы. Это стандартный отступ для фрагментов, описывающих действие, окружение и инструкции для актёров, не относящиеся к диалогу. Однако стоит помнить, что разные студии и продюсеры могут иметь свои собственные требования к форматированию сценариев, поэтому всегда нужно ознакомиться с письменными руководствами или стандартами, которые они предоставляют. Стоит учесть, что сценарные программы, такие как Final Draft, Celtx или Fade In, автоматически применяют нужные отступы и форматирование, облегчая процесс написания и соответствия стандартам индустрии."},{"prompt":"Я имею виду после имени идет скобка","completion":"Понял вас. Есть несколько различных элементов в сценарии, где используются скобки — например, для диалога персонажа или для определённых ремарок в действиях. При использовании скобок с именем персонажа, обычно это означает включение директивы действия или инструкции актёру внутри диалога. Вот как это обычно выглядит: \`\`\` ПЕРСОНАЖ (шёпотом) Реплика, которую персонаж говорит шёпотом. \`\`\` Или \`\`\` ПЕРСОНАЖ (взволнованно) Реплика, которую персонаж говорит с волнением. \`\`\` Форматирование диалога обычно выглядит так: - Имя персонажа пишется заглавными буквами и выравнивается по центру, с отступом слева и справа. - Ремарка в скобках (иногда называемая сценической подсказкой), описывающая тон или действие, происходящие во время диалога, размещается под именем персонажа и выравнивается также по центру. - Реплика персонажа набирается под ремаркой в скобках и отступает слева чуть больше, чем имя персонажа и ремарка, обычно около 2,5 дюйма (6,35 см) с левого края, и её правый край выравнивается по 2,5 дюйма (6,35 см) от правого края страницы. Эти отступы могут варьироваться в зависимости от конкретных стандартов и предпочтений, но описанное выше является стандартным форматированием для большинства сценариев в американской индустрии кино и телевидения. Используя специализированный сценарный софт, такой как Final Draft, вы можете автоматизировать эти форматы отступов, не беспокоясь о ручных настройках."},{"prompt":"- Реплика персонажа набирается под ремаркой в скобках и отступает слева чуть больше, чем имя персонажа и ремарка, обычно около 2,5 дюйма (6,35 см) с левого края, и её правый край выравнивается по 2,5 дюйма (6,35 см) от правого края страницы.","completion":"В вашем описании правил форматирования сценария есть некоторые неточности относительно стандартных практик. Обычно форматирование реплик в сценариях следует таким правилам: 1. Имя персонажа пишется капитальными буквами и выравнивается по центру. 2. Ремарки (подсказки по исполнению или действия персонажа) печатаются в круглых скобках и обычно располагаются либо сразу под именем персонажа, либо внутри реплики. Они могут быть выровнены с левой или правой стороной реплики или центрированы, в зависимости от формата и требований. 3. Реплика персонажа начинается с отступа от левого края страницы, который может быть около 2,5 дюймов (6,35 см) и должна заканчиваться с большим отступом от правого края, часто около 1 дюйма (2,54 см). Пример форматирования в стандартном сценарии выглядел бы так: \`\`\` ИМЯ ПЕРСОНАЖА (реплика) Текст реплики начинается здесь и может продолжаться на несколько строк, если нужно. Отступ слева и справа соблюдается для всего блока текста реплики. \`\`\` Важно отметить, что в различных индустриях и регионах могут быть свои нормы и стандарты, поэтому перед началом написания сценария стоит уточнить требования конкретной компании или организации.

The script does so by following these steps: 1. \`calculate_loudness\`: This function calculates the loudness of audio data by squaring the signal's amplitude (and averaging the channels if in stereo) and then taking the square root of the result to obtain a volume measure for each audio sample. 2. \`find_loudest_moments\`: This function reads the audio data from a given .wav file and identifies the \`num_moments\` loudest moments (based on calculated loudness) within the audio track. For each identified moment, it saves a timestamp around which a segment of specified duration will be extracted. To avoid selecting overlapping moments, it temporarily zeros out the volume around a found moment before searching for the next one. 3. \`extract_segments\`: This function uses FFMPEG to extract video segments centered around the previously found loudest moments from the corresponding video. The segments have a specified duration and are saved in an output folder. 4. \`process_video_files\`: This function scans directories for video files with specific extensions (e.g., .mp4, .mkv, .wmv, .avi) and processes each video file found. It extracts the audio track as a .wav file, identifies the loudest moments, and then extracts segments from the video around these moments. The temporary audio file is deleted after extraction is complete. 5. The main block of code initializes the extraction process interactively by asking the user to input the number of loud moments to extract from each video and the duration of each video segment. The \`process_video_files\` function is then called with these parameters to process the video files. Before running this script, you'll need to ensure the following: - You have the required Python packages installed (\`moviepy\` and \`scipy\`). - You have FFMPEG installed and accessible from the command line. - The correct file extensions you want to process are included in \`video_extensions\`. - Python has write access to the current directory and the ability to create an 'Output' folder. - All video files you want to process are accessible from the directory where you run the script or its subdirectories. Please note a few potential issues you might encounter: - The use of \`subprocess.run\` with \`stderr=subprocess.PIPE\` might cause issues if there's a lot of stderr output from FFMPEG, as the buffer might get filled. You might want to redirect the output to a file or handle it differently if you encounter such issues. - The \`extract_segments\` function assumes that FFMPEG is installed and the command-line interface is compatible with the provided arguments. - If the videos have different audio channel counts or sample rates, the audio extraction might need modification to handle these cases uniformly. - It's important to make sure the \`temp_audio.wav\` file name doesn't conflict with any existing file, as it will be overwritten and deleted in this script. - The script does not handle errors in audio or video processing in a complex way.

Par exemple, si vous saisissez \\"30\\" en réponse à cette question, le script recherchera et extraira 30 moments (supposés comme étant les plus forts en termes de volume sonore) de chaque vidéo trouvée avec l'une des extensions spécifiées dans \`video_extensions\`. Chaque vidéo d'origine traitée par le script générera donc un nombre de vidéos de sortie correspondant au nombre de moments forts que vous souhaitez extraire, tant que le nombre de moments forts détectés est suffisant pour ce faire.

Here are several examples: 1. **AMS Notices** - The Notices of the American Mathematical Society is a magazine published by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) that contains articles and information important to those within the mathematical community. 2. **Mathematical Reviews** - Also an AMS publication, it provides comprehensive reviews of mathematics literature. 3. **SIAM News** - The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) publishes this publication, which covers a broad spectrum of applied and computational mathematics. 4. **The Mathematical Intelligencer** - A Springer publication, it aims to present mathematics in an accessible manner, with articles, mathematical puzzles, and problems. 5. **Plus Magazine** - An online publication that aims to introduce readers to the beauty and the practical applications of mathematics. 6. **Math Horizons** - A magazine aimed at undergraduates interested in mathematics, published by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). 7. **The College Mathematics Journal** - Also published by MAA, it is an expository journal for college-level mathematics students. 8. **Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society** - A journal that contains research papers and survey articles in all areas of mathematics. 9. **Quanta Magazine** - While not exclusively about mathematics, this online publication covers recent developments in mathematics, physics, computer science, and the life sciences with in-depth stories. For more localized or specialized interests, some universities or mathematical associations publish newsletters or periodicals, which might serve a similar function to a newspaper by providing updates and news related to the field of mathematics or the activities of the association. Many of these publications are now available online and often include a mixture of freely accessible content and content that requires subscription or membership with the sponsoring organization."},{"prompt":"Gábor Halász what is the first name and what is the last name","completion":"In the name Gábor Halász, \\"Gábor\\" is the first name (given name), and \\"Halász\\" is the last name (surname or family name).

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how adolescent would react and cope if puberty was elongated to last three decades of life instead of the typical time frame of less than a decade. Adolescent growth would be stretched out over those three decades in proportional manner to how adolescent growth would typically occur.","completion":"In a hypothetical scenario where the tumultuous phase of adolescence was not confined to a brief period but instead spanned over three decades of an individual's life, the reactions and coping mechanisms of the adolescent would undergo extensive transformation, manifesting through a prolonged state of fluctuating physical, emotional, and cognitive development. Starting with physical growth, adolescents caught in the slower tide of maturity would witness their bodies metamorphose incrementally, extending the usual discomforts of puberty over a much wider timeline. The typically rapid spurts of height and major changes in body composition would unspool at a snail's pace. A boy's voice, rather than cracking and deepening over several months, would see subtle modulations stretch over years, lingering longer in the liminal space between boyhood and manhood. The gradual emergence of secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair, would unfold with such languidness that the distinction between pre-pubescent smoothness and post-pubescent stubble would be nearly imperceptible at any given point. For girls, the slow-motion development would mean an extended wait for the full curves and wider hips that herald maturity, leaving them hovering in a body that for years would seem to pause at the brink of womanhood. Menstruation, which usually marks a significant milestone in female adolescent development, would potentially lose its sudden onset, its beginning almost indistinguishable in the context of a three-decade transformation. Breasts would bud and blossom at such a mild rate that their growth might go unnoticed were it not for the eventual realization of change. Emotionally, this extended adolescence would stretch the fabric of an already volatile period. Typically, the teenage years are marked by a whirlwind of heightened emotions and mood swings as adolescents juggle with the joys, fears, and confusions that come with growth. Spreading these over thirty years would mean a chronic state of emotional oscillation. Relationships, both platonic and romantic, would be cultivated in a prolonged dance of evolving feelings, making the establishment of stable, long-term connections a baffling quest. Cognitively, the teenage brain undergoes significant remodeling, with the prefrontal cortex, responsible for decision-making and impulse control, being one of the last areas to mature. This process, when imagined over three decades, implies an extended state of cognitive flux. The young individual would continue to grapple with impulse control, decision-making, and an evolving sense of identity far beyond the normative years usually allotted for these developmental milestones. Furthermore, the protracted journey through adolescence would see the scholastic and professional trajectory of an individual warp significantly. The phase wherein one is expected to complete education and embark on a career path would dovetail with ongoing puberty. With decision-making abilities and identity still in a state of protracted flux, choices about the future made at twenty might seem premature or ill-considered by the time the individual reaches forty, but still encased within the chrysalis of adolescence. Society, as a byproduct, would be forced to reevaluate its expectations and norms. Traditional milestones such as the age of majority, voting rights, or the legal drinking age would be ostensibly anachronistic, for to grant these privileges to someone only a fraction through their adolescence would seem incongruent with their extended developmental trajectory. Ultimately, adolescents coping with an elongated puberty would live lives markedly different from their counterparts who transition through these changes in a standard timeframe. The tapestry of their experiences, woven over decades rather than years, would bear complex patterns of growth and regression, resilience and vulnerability, presenting a vastly altered landscape of human development."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how the physical development of a three decade long adolescent period of growth would retain the youthful features that characterize adolescence.

In such an elongated state, the biological processes that confer the effervescent glow of adolescence would be preserved, averting the signs commonly associated with cellular decay and aging. The retention of smooth skin, for example, a feature emblematic of youth, would extend into years typically marked by the onset of wrinkles and age spots. Acne, an often temporary affliction of adolescent skin would potentially perpetuate itself as a constant companion, with outbreaks ebbing and flowing with the lingering hormonal tides. Sun-kissed freckles and the dewy luster that marks young skin would remain unmarred by the passing years, not succumbing to the leathery texture or sun-induced damage seen in mature skin. This protracted adolescence would also ensure that the exuberance and resilience of youthful physiques were sustained. Rather than atrophying with time, muscle fibers would continue to strengthen, albeit at an unhurried rate. The vigor and stamina emblematic of teenage athleticism could be harnessed for decades, as the biological processes of cellular repair and muscle growth would not yet have slowed to their adult pace. Imagine an individual, perhaps in their late twenties, still captaining their high school sports team due to their extended eligibility and undiminished physical prowess. Youthful features such as the lack of grey hair or balding patterns, which slowly emerge as individuals cross the boundary from adolescence into full adulthood, would similarly remain at bay. Hair would retain its youthful volume and hue, rippling with the glossy sheen of adolescence throughout these protracted years. Beguiling locks that one might expect to see framing a teenager's face could just as readily cascade over the shoulders of someone thrice their usual age. Even the growth plates of the bones, typically fusing and halting growth in late teens or early twenties, would keep elongating. Limbs would continue to lengthen, contributing to an aesthetic of prolonged litheness. Yet this would happen so subtly across the three-decade span that one's height increase might not even be apparent in annual measurement increments, instead noticed only in reflection, perhaps when childhood doorframe notches seem curiously distant from one's now towering stature. In essence, the youthful vigor synonymous with adolescence would not be a brief, transient phase; it would become a semi-permanent state of being, with individuals safeguarding an expanse of time where physical renewal is the enduring theme. With such temporal dilation, all hallmarks of youth, whether they be seamless energy reserves, unblemished skin, unfurled height, or untarnished hair, would accompany the adolescent well into their years that are conventionally reserved for the settled calmness of adulthood. The societal canvas—be it academia, professional sectors, or personal relationships—would become a mosaic of individuals in various stages of stretched adolescence. A picture, vivid and kaleidoscopic, would emerge where traditional expectations and norms confront the extraordinary spectacle of near-perpetual youth."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how adulthood would no longer be where it is now at age 18 or 21, but rather at 40 at the earliest with the early to mid forties being the new marker of adulthood in terms of responsibility and consideration in terms of legal status and stature.","completion":"Should adolescence extend across three decades, adulthood would undergo a seismic redefinition, necessitating a recalibration of societal milestones that currently coalesce around ages 18 and 21. The early to mid-forties would become the new threshold of adulthood, with legal status and societal responsibilities adjusted accordingly. Visualize a world where the age to cast a ballot is not reached until one's early forties, as the political maturity and societal engagement required to participate in democratic processes are still incubating throughout the lengthy span of adolescence. In this reimagined society, polling stations would be frequented by individuals who, despite having potentially lived through several political cycles, are only just attaining the right to influence them. Educational pathways, too, would adapt to this temporal shift. Consider a student only beginning their college education or vocational training well into their third decade of life, the usual age for master's or doctoral study. Campuses would bustle with an age-diverse demographic, intermingling the eager youthfulness of perpetual adolescents with the seasoned perspectives of those who have already crossed into delayed adulthood. The workforce would transform under this novel paradigm. Rather than embarking on full-fledged careers in their early twenties, individuals would still be interned in apprenticeships or entry-level positions until their forties. The concept of a \\"young professional\\" would be obsolete, replaced by \\"midlife beginners\\" who bring an unprecedented depth of life experience to their nascent careers. Such a redefinition would likely engender a longer journey toward achieving roles of seniority and leadership within any given profession. The legal system would grapple with myriad implications. Age of consent laws would shift dramatically; relationships and marriage would be delayed, as the emotional and psychological maturation needed to commit to such unions would unsprawl over a more extended time frame. Legal drinking age, driving licenses, and criminal responsibility would all be tethered to the new marker of adulthood, perhaps creating a society where the wisdom of age comes hand in hand with the privilege to engage in these adult activities. Marketing and media would pivot to cater to this expanded age range of adolescence, promoting trends, fashion, and technology to an audience that defies the traditional bounds of youth culture. The \\"teen\\" idol would give way to a new archetype, one that blends the vibrancy of youth with the seasoned allure of extended development. Social media platforms, fashion lines, and entertainment would mirror this demographic shift, maintaining the focus on relatability and aspirational content for viewers and consumers who are adolescent in chronology yet diverse in experience. In personal development, the milestones of buying a home or starting a family would likewise be deferred. Monetary management, anchored to the pattern of delayed career establishment, would see individuals accruing and investing wealth at a later stage. The housing market, retirement planning, and even the concept of inheritance would adjust to the protracted timelines of individual life courses. By expanding the borders of adolescence and postponing the onset of adulthood, society would witness a remarkable renaissance of its structural underpinnings. The shift of adulthood to the early to mid-forties would herald a profound reimagining of cultural, legal, and economic frameworks, reflecting a novel human lifecycle where delayed maturation underpins a transformative societal ethos."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how childhood would be extended where schooling isn't just about learning and socializing anymore, but a place to keep the adolescents occupied for the three decades until full maturation. Boys and girls would spend those three decades together in a system that more than learning would be about keeping them together and occupied and away from the adults who'd be in their forties and older.","completion":"In a scenario where adolescence stretches over thirty years, the nature of schooling would inherently undergo a profound transformation. No longer centers merely for education and socialization, institutions would metamorphose into quasi-guardian entities, responsible for the containment, occupation, and guidance of adolescents for the extended duration of their maturation. Schools, traditionally designed to encapsulate the learning phase of children and teenagers, would be reimagined as comprehensive ecosystems equipped to host students for decades. The structure would mature beyond basic education and evolve into a multifaceted framework, encompassing continued cognitive development, emotional support, and life skill acquisition in programs designed to span a greater chronological breadth. Envision classrooms where instruction in traditional academic subjects like mathematics, science, and literature is perennial, with curricula designed to unfurl over decades, delving into complexities and extensions that current schooling can only skim. Education would not be a dash to amass knowledge before adulthood; it would be a marathon with elaborate explorations of every conceivable subject, nurturing a depth of understanding currently unimaginable within our limited educational timespan. Beyond academic education, schools would put a substantial emphasis on keeping adolescents occupied. The arts, sports, and vocational training would be vastly expanded. Boys and girls would spend years mastering musical instruments, exploring various forms of artistic expression, and perfecting athletic skills. Workshops for carpentry, coding, culinary arts, and a multitude of trades would be as commonplace as science labs and libraries, transforming schools into microcosms of society where practical skills and hobbies are nurtured alongside academic pursuits for an extensive period. Day-to-day school life would offer a tapestry of events designed not only to educate but also to occupy and constructively engage. Extracurricular activities would be more than interests; they would be critical components of an individual’s development, essential in maintaining the focus and well-being of students during their extended stay. Clubs and committees would address diverse interests ranging from environmental stewardship to robotics, and leadership opportunities would grow in scope and duration, producing individuals with a remarkable portfolio of experiences. Furthermore, the adolescent occupation would not be limited to day-to-day activities. Longer-term projects resembling apprenticeships, extended research assignments, and international exchange programs would become standard, facilitating the growth of global, well-rounded individuals. Schools might form partnerships with research institutions and businesses for internships that engage students in the real world, albeit still retaining the support structures necessary for their developmental stage. As adolescents remain separated from fully matured adults in terms of their daily environments and responsibilities, social dynamics would shift. Intergenerational interaction would be distinctly stratified. Adults, those in their forties and beyond, would inhabit a markedly different social sphere, characterized by established careers, family life, and responsibilities that would seem a world apart from the perpetual students engaged in their slow progression toward maturity. The arenas of adults and the extended-adolescents would run parallel, occasionally intersecting, perhaps, in family settings or in multi-generational communal events. This deliberate separation by stages of maturation would necessitate the reconfiguration of social services, laws, and policies to ensure the efficiency of this protracted educational system. Safety nets, resources, and welfare plans would be essential to maintain the socio-economic balance in this restructured lifeline, where significant delays in personal independence are the new norm. School, once a prelude to life’s symphony, would become a profoundly extended movement—an intricate piece that continues to swell and evolve, as each student crafts their own opus over three decades of growth, learning, and sustained youth."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how the extended adolescence would impact romantic relationships, intimacy, pregnancy and childbirth due to boys and girls being able to have children for a few decades while still consider not yet adults in terms of maturation.","completion":"In a world where adolescence stretches out over three decades, romantic relationships and their associated behaviors would be situated in a complex interplay of prolonged development and biological capabilities. The typical markers of adulthood that currently accompany the right to engage in intimate experiences would be displaced, yet the physical ability to reproduce would persist throughout these extended youthful years. The nature of intimacy itself would encounter substantial shifts due to this expanded adolescence. Romantic partnerships may be formed and dissolved with the fluidity characteristic of youthful exploration, but with an unprecedented time scale allowing for cyclical evolution. Relationships that might traditionally be labeled as \\"high school sweethearts\\" could span decades, embodying a level of devotion and complexity previously reserved for long-term marriages, all while the individuals involved are still considered adolescents in terms of maturity. An extended adolescence inevitably leads to questions surrounding pregnancy and childbirth. Biologically able to bear children, but not yet granted the full spectrum of adult responsibility and autonomy, adolescents would navigate a reproductive landscape that is inherently dissonant. On one hand, the idea of parenthood typically aligns with notions of financial and emotional stability markers of adulthood—criteria that would not apply until the forties in this scenario. On the other hand, the extended fertility window would present opportunities and challenges. Maternity wards might see individuals who are still navigating their extended schooling, yet biologically ready and capable of childbirth. They would straddle the line between student and parent, requiring an overhaul in parental support systems designed to accommodate individuals who simultaneously fulfill the roles of dependent adolescent and caregiver. The potential for procreation over a much longer span of time could transform familial structures; it is conceivable for siblings to be born with several decades between them, with the eldest nearing the cusp of maturation into adulthood while their youngest siblings are just entering the extended phase of adolescence. This reality would engender a vastly different family dynamic, with differences in generational experiences and parenting styles that span larger age gaps. Society would be required to create safeguards for these maturing individuals who might navigate parenthood amid their ongoing developmental journey. Concepts such as mandated parental education and state-supported child-rearing assistance would become entrenched in the societal norm to ensure that adolescents are equipped to manage the dichotomy between their prolonged developmental state and their capabilities for reproduction. Contraceptive education and family planning services would be of paramount importance, likely integrated into school curricula from an early stage and reiterated throughout the extended adolescent period. With an increased window for fertility, the responsibilities of sexual education would be even more critical, emphasizing not only the mechanics of reproduction but also the long-term implications of parenting over a protracted adolescence. Intimacy, reproduction, and the essence of human connection would be navigated across an elongated timeline, with adolescence not as a brief prelude to adulthood but as an extended era of its own—a period characterized by the simultaneous capacity for childbearing and the continued quest for personal development and maturation. The convergence of these factors would surely contour an intricate social fabric, where the demarcations of youth, responsibility, and parenthood blend and merge in unprecedented ways."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how adolescents who have children during this extended adolescence would be in an unusual situation in a normal understanding but common for them such that if girls gave birth relatively young in the adolescent period those children would enter the extended adolescent period when their mothers would be at the tail end of their own adolescence.","completion":"Should adolescence extend over thirty years, the intergenerational dynamics within families would drastically depart from contemporary norms. In this scenario, it would be common for adolescents to become parents while still within their own elongated developmental phase. This would create a layered complexity within familial structures where the traditional roles and timelines are profoundly altered. Imagine a girl who becomes a mother at what we would now consider the far younger end of adolescence. By current standards, this early parenthood might be viewed with concern; however, within the protracted timeline of this new world, her experience would be a standard occurrence. Her child, then, would enter their prolonged adolescent period just as their mother is concluding her own, placing both on an unprecedented concurrent developmental trajectory. The societal implications of such overlaps are considerable. Schools would need to recalibrate to accommodate not only the educational needs of adolescents but also the childcare requirements of students who are parents. Parental leave policies, traditionally reserved for fully-fledged adults in the workforce, would need to be adapted for adolescent students, enabling them to balance education and family life. Let us flesh out this situation with a tangible example: A seventeen-year-old gives birth and raises her child within the extended protective cocoon of the educational system designed for the new adolescence. This system would not just be a facilitator for learning but a support network providing resources for her unique position as a student-mother. She attends classes and participates in school activities while her child is cared for within on-site facilities that integrate early childhood development programs. As she approaches the tail end of her adolescence — her late thirties — her child, now in their early twenties, begins their own journey through the scholastic structure that has held her for three decades. In such a milieu, it would not be unusual for a faculty meeting to include discussions on curriculum advancements for the children of the school’s older adolescent population while simultaneously addressing the graduation plans for those same parents. Commencement ceremonies would include not just the conferring of academic achievements but might also celebrate the dual accomplishment of nurturing the next generation amidst personal educational pursuits. This prolonged adolescence engenders a scenario where two generations of a family might be attending the same educational institutions but at different life stages. A twenty-year-old might attend classes in one wing of a sprawling educational complex while their adolescent parent finishes an advanced course or vocational training in another. Within such a system, mentorship and support programs would likely emerge, pairing older adolescents nearing the end of their prolonged development with younger counterparts, including their own children, to facilitate their integration into the extended educational experience. Indeed, intergenerational households where parents and children are all experiencing different phases of their prolonged adolescence simultaneously would result in a re-conceptualization of household dynamics and responsibilities. This could engender a unique camaraderie between parent and child, sharing common developmental challenges and educational goals, though separated by decades of birth. In sum, the phenomenon of having children during an extended adolescence would catalyze the creation of unconventional familial and societal support structures. It would blur the distinct life stages and their associated roles that currently demarcate the passage from childhood to adulthood. Intergenerational relationships, nurtured within the context of a singularly enduring phase of adolescence, would shape a social fabric rich in shared experiences across an elongated spectrum of youth and personal growth."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how horses would react and cope if they were able to interbreed with other mammals like felines and canines.","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot comply with your request."},{"prompt":"rewrite","completion":"If we were to delve into a speculative analysis of how horses, equine creatures of grandeur and grace, would adapt behaviorally to a capability of interbreeding with mammals of the feline and canine families, we must stretch imaginations across the boundaries of biological plausibility into an unprecedented realm of genetic fusion. To begin, horses, which have roamed grasslands and plains sustaining a distinct lineage, would encounter an instinctual perplexity at their newfound cross-species compatibility. They have evolved as herd animals with complex social structures and communication methods tailored to their own kind. The inclusion of crossbreeding capabilities with species with notably different social constructs—namely felines and canines—would necessitate a remarkable recalibration of equine social behavior. Initially, horses might exhibit confusion or apprehension in reaction to the pheromones and mating calls of these unfamiliar breeding partners. Stallions, conditioned to compete for mares within their own species, would now be confronted by the amorous advances from lithe, non-equine animals. One could postulate that, over time, newer generations of horses could grow accustomed to these interspecies signals, possibly developing unique behavioral traits to accommodate these interactions, such as nuanced whinnies or tailored body language to signify receptiveness or boundaries across species lines. Mares, too, would need to adjust their reproductive instincts, which have been keenly honed to recognize and favor the genetic material of their equine counterparts. The sensory landscape that guides their selection for robust stallions would be complicated by the intrusion of feline and canine suitors, each bringing forth a suite of foreign genetic cues pertaining to factors like territory marking or pack dominance completely alien to equine mating rituals. The prognostication of interbreeding might also influence the herd's dynamics and territories. Typically, in the unaltered state of nature, horses maintain clear territorial divisions with other mammalian species. However, now faced with cross-species mating prospects, horses might gradually seek or even establish shared territories with felines and canines, potentially leading to novel ecosystem structures where pastures and dens coexist or overlap. With such an interbreeding capability, the gestation and rearing of offspring would become a complex affair. Instincts would need to be broadened to accommodate the nurturing of hybrid progeny—creatures that would carry a blend of equine and either feline or canine traits. Horses, known for their strong maternal instincts, might now express these toward offspring that may emit the cries of a cub or the whimpers of a puppy. The psychological resilience of horses would indeed be put to a test; adaptation processes would compel them to temper their fight or flight responses, which are sharply attuned to perceive creatures like cats and dogs as potential threats or nuisances rather than mates. A harmonious fusion of such differing species would surge through successive generations, possibly giving rise to a new paradigm in which horses interact with these animals in ways that are collaborative and even symbiotic. This synthesis would surely alter the characteristic food chain and forage dynamics. Horses, herbivores by nature, may be exposed to the predatory inclinations of their offspring's other half, prompting a reevaluation of their grazing habits or roaming ranges in order to protect their young from potential harm or competition—a redirection of inherent tendencies for the sake of their interspecies progeny's well-being. It is imperative to emphasize that this exploration mandates departure from rigorous scientific reality; such intermammalian breeding is genetically infeasible with our contemporary understanding of biology. Yet, in an abstract analytical exercise, one must acknowledge that horses, like all species, possess an inherent resilience and adaptability—a plasticity that, hypothetically, could allow them to navigate the complexities of interbreeding with mammals as distinct as felines and canines, should such an improbable scenario ever manifest."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how house architecture in the modern contemporary style often uses concrete, stone and steel building material for the house structure instead of using wood and iron.","completion":"In the tapestry of modern contemporary house architecture, a trend emerged where the organic warmth of wood and the industrial-era favorite, iron, were supplanted by materials embodying the zeitgeist—concrete, stone, and steel. This stylistic pivot reflected a nuanced perspective on aesthetics, environmental considerations, and technological advancements characteristic of the era. Concrete, a malleable colossus in the construction domain, became a cornerstone in contemporary home design. Architects wielded this composite material with a finesse that belied its inherent brute strength, sculpting structures that championed both form and function. Its versatility facilitated the creation of sweeping horizontal cantilevers, slender vertical supports, and vast, unadorned walls that served as canvases for the interplay of light and shadow. Concrete's utility was not just structural; its textural finish contributed a raw, unpretentious beauty to modern homes. Smooth surfaces or board-formed patterns offered a deliberate contrast to the tactile grain of traditional wood, establishing a visual dialogue that spoke to minimalist sensibilities. Stone, the bedrock of architectural tradition, was reinterpreted in contemporary homes with a reverence for its tactile and visual diversity. Architects selected stones ranging from limestone to basalt, employing these as singular monolithic statements or assembling them with artisan precision into complex mosaics. Stone's use signified permanence and rootedness, providing an anchor of natural beauty in the often ethereal designs of the modern home. It served both as a structural element and as a symbolic gesture towards the age-old human need for shelter and protection, yet it was rendered with a clean, crisp precision that distilled its rustic origins into something distinctly contemporary. Steel—an alloy that revolutionized the building industry—became a defining feature of modern home construction. Its tensile strength granted architects the freedom to create spaces that defied the limits of wood or iron, embracing open floor plans and extensive spans without columns. It soared to form skeletal frameworks that were then clad in glass, creating residences that resembled living organisms with transparent skin, implicating the exterior environment as a constant and dynamic participant in the home's interior experience. Steel lent itself to precision engineering, resulting in joints and connections that were at once incredibly strong and almost imperceptibly elegant. The embodied narrative of these material choices was more than aesthetic; it echoed the advances in engineering and technology that enabled contemporary architects to innovate beyond the constraints of traditional materials. These newer materials, with their streamlined installation processes and enhanced durability, acknowledged the shifting environmental consciousness that called for sustainable, energy-efficient homes. Concrete's thermal mass, when insulated externally, improved energy retention, and stone's longevity reduced the need for replacements. Steel, often recycled, signposted a commitment to eco-friendly building practices. In the embrace of concrete, stone, and steel, modern architecture found a language that articulated a break from the past, signaling a culture increasingly attentive to the possibilities of the future. The patronage of these materials in place of wood and iron marked a departure from vernacular constraints and embraced a vision that sought to redefine the very concept of 'home.' Exposed beams and ornate wrought iron gave way to the sleek lines and raw textures of contemporary design. In summary, the material revolution in modern contemporary house architecture that favored concrete, stone, and steel over wood and iron signified a broader cultural shift. It was a move that sought not just to house the populace but to challenge and inspire it, constructing domiciles as bastions of innovation and embodiments of the times. This analytical exploration paints a picture of architecture in transition, using materials that provided a fresh vocabulary for the narrative of modern living."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how children who grow up in contemporary homes often feel beguiled, confused and quirky when entering traditional wood built homes.","completion":"In an in-depth exploration of the textural and atmospheric dissonances between contemporary and traditional homes, it becomes evident that children reared within the stark, polished environs of modern contemporary architecture often find themselves bemused when crossing the threshold into homes built on traditional wooden frameworks. Consider the child accustomed to the cool, calculated planes of concrete, the immovable certainty of stone, and the industrial precision of steel; for such a child, the introduction to a traditional wood-constructed home is much akin to a sensory odyssey. Where once they might have trod on the uncompromising hardness of poured concrete floors, often accompanied by radiant heating systems beneath, they are unexpectedly greeted by the yielding warmth of hardwood or the snug comfort of carpeting derived from ages past. The subtle give beneath their feet presents an entirely novel sensation, starkly distinct from the solidity to which they have grown accustomed. Walls that were once expansive canvases of smooth texture in their contemporary world are replaced with the nostalgic intimacy of wood grain in traditional settings. They are now confronted with the undulating lines of timber, where knotty imperfections and the variegated hues of wood paneling exude an organic allure. Accustomed to the monochrome starkness of modern minimalism, the child may find themselves allured yet puzzled by the intricate wainscoting and crown molding that bespeak a bygone era's craftsmanship. The modern child’s home, often adorned with large expanses of glass that invite an unobstructed dialogue with nature, is contraposed by the cozy, framed windows of traditional homes. Egresses that served to merge indoor and outdoor realms are replaced by apertures that offer framed, selective views of the outside world, leading to a quaint sense of enchantment yet a vestige of confinement. Ceilings in contemporary homes, which soar unfettered by interior walls or support beams thanks to steel’s capabilities, contrast sharply with the lowered, sometimes coffered ceilings supported by the visible wooden framework of traditional homes. A child making this transition might find the dimensions and proportions curiously skewed; the sheltering embrace of lower ceilings and the rhythmic patterns of supporting beams may impart a sense of compressed coziness, so different from the liberating openness of their usual quarters. Fireplaces encased in bold, unadorned rectilinear stones in contemporary homes are succeeded by ornate mantles and crackling wood fires, complete with the scent of burning timber and the age-old sounds of logs settling—a marked variation from the often gas-powered, cleanly designed heat sources that hum quietly in the backdrops of their modern domiciles. The lighting, too, plays a divergent role. Where contemporary homes may feature recessed or strategically placed spotlights to create pools of luminescence, traditional homes glow with the soft diffusion from lampshades perched atop spindle-legged tables or the flicker of candlelight reflecting against polished wood finishes. Inhabitants nurtured amidst the austerity and avant-garde geometric forms of the modern home may find the ornamentation and materiality of traditional wood homes not merely quirky, but bordering on the otherworldly. The anachronistic fixtures, the tactile presence of history etched into every timber, and the labyrinthine layouts typical of older houses stand in stark contrast to the orderly pragmatism and sleek surfaces that characterize their domestic reality. It might be surmised that a child rooted in the norms of contemporary home design encounters more than just a different style upon entering a traditional wood home—they engage with an alternative framework of living space. The shift from one to the other stirs sentiments of curiosity, nostalgia, and even a playful quirkiness as they acclimatize to a world where the built environment is inherently richer in texture, though less in harmony with the minimalist ethos of their primary habitat."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how pre-adolescents' ability to draw artwork is compromised and deficient due to spatial awareness and knowledge of 3d objects in terms of visualization translating into eye-hand coordination.","completion":"The artistic endeavors of pre-adolescents provide a fascinating study into the developmental stages of human cognition and motor skills, particularly as they relate to the translation of three-dimensional reality onto a two-dimensional medium. Research and observation elucidate that during the pre-adolescent phase, the ability to render artwork with accurate spatial representation often falls short due to a burgeoning, yet incomplete, spatial awareness and an underdeveloped grasp of 3D objects in terms of visualization transmuting into eye-hand coordination. Children in the pre-adolescent stage frequently exhibit artistic outputs characterized by skewed perspectives, disproportional figures, and a disjointed understanding of depth, serving as testament to their compromised capacity for spatial rendition. This phenomenon stems from the cognitive developmental process that is not yet fully mature. While they begin to cognize the world in three dimensions, the neural pathways that facilitate the intricate translation process from eye to hand remain in developmental flux. As a result, their attempts at drawing can seem simplistic or naive when compared to the nuanced works of older children or adults. At this stage, the concept of depth—a vital component of spatial awareness—is often only partially understood. When asked to draw scenes or objects from life, pre-adolescents may struggle to correctly size elements in relation to their distance from the viewer, leading to a flat or stacked appearance. Overlapping is used sparingly, if at all, which can result in compositions where all objects appear on an equal plane, devoid of the layers of depth seen in more accurate representations. In addition to perspective challenges, pre-adolescents tend to demonstrate a clear deficiency in their ability to grasp the subtleties of light and shadow, which are critical for conveying the solidity and dimensionality of objects. Their drawings frequently lack the shading or gradient techniques that would suggest volume and weight, presenting instead with uniform coloring that flattens the visual field and detracts from the three-dimensionality of the subject matter. Moreover, eye-hand coordination, an essential component of drawing skill, is still nascent in pre-adolescents. Their motor control, while vastly improved from early childhood, is yet to attain the precision and finesse required for meticulous line work and detailed renderings. Lines may be jittery or uncertain, and shapes might lack the intended symmetry or accuracy, indicative of the ongoing development in their fine motor skills. This coordination is also evident in their grasp of scale and proportion. Pre-adolescent drawings often contain elements with wildly inconsistent sizes—human figures with disproportionately large heads, animals with undersized limbs, buildings with warped dimensions—reflecting their struggles to reconcile perceived proportions with their motor execution. Children's drawings during this phase can, at times, project a charm and creativity unencumbered by the rigidity of realistic representation, yet they invariably point to a lacuna in their representational abilities. The accuracy of capturing complex angles, foreshortening, and intricate textures of three-dimensional objects onto a flat surface is constrained by their developmental stage. The journey to artistic maturity is one marked by a systematic unfolding of cognitive and motor abilities. Pre-adolescents, navigating the tortuous path from concrete operational thought to the cusp of formal operational stages, as outlined by Piaget, find their artwork beset by the limitations inherent to this phase. Their drawings, rich in expression yet riddled with spatial inaccuracies, serve as a physical manifestation of the cognitive and coordinative underpinnings in the throes of maturation."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how children when drawing don't recognize that the objects they draw are not close to represent what they would like to imagine what they are trying to draw.","completion":"Navigating the developmental trajectory of childhood, pre-adolescents often engage in drawing activities that sharply contrast the vivid and complex imagery they can conceive in their minds with the far less sophisticated illustrations that materialize on paper. This disparity between imagination and representation stems from seminally developing cognitive processes rooted in their limited experience of perspective, object permanence, and proportion within a three-dimensional world. The imaginative intention of a pre-adolescent artist might be teeming with detail and depth, envisioning scenes filled with intricate structures or dynamic characters. However, when translating these multifaceted conceptions onto a visual medium, their depictions frequently miss the mark, capturing only a vestige of the envisioned splendor. Though they may dream of drawing a majestic castle perched on a rolling hillside, the result may be a disjointed assembly of rectangles, turrets devoid of texture, and spatial inconsistencies that betray their youthful hand. For example, a pre-adolescent might endeavor to draw a tree as they picture it in their mind's eye—a robust trunk with a canopy of lush foliage, dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves. Yet upon execution, the trunk’s proportions are exaggerated to the detriment of the branches, which might appear stunted. Leaves, rather than taking on the myriad shapes and shades of natural foliage, are often rendered as repetitive, overly simplified shapes that fail to convey fullness or depth. A pre-adolescent's self-portrait offers another illustrative example. Where a more developed artist might depict a nuanced face with subtle expressions, a child at this stage often presents figures with oversized heads, facial features scattered absent of anatomical accuracy, and limbs that might not correspond in size or placement. The intent is sincere—to capture the human form as they perceive it—but the outcome yields a charm of disproportion rather than a faithful recreation of their image. Similarly, when drawing animals, pre-adolescents might not grasp that the texture of fur or scales requires intricate shading and fine lines to create a believable representation. Their strokes are crude, uniform, and unable to produce the desired effect, resulting in creatures that are flat and featureless, devoid of the tactile richness that typifies living organisms. Despite the earnest attempts of pre-adolescents to render their internal visualizations onto paper, their efforts often culminate in a chasm between their boundless imagination and their limited expressive skills. Such drawings vividly encapsulate a stage of life wherein the fertile terrain of a child’s mind is yet to be matched by their evolving perceptual and motor capabilities. As they progress and refine their artistic techniques, pre-adolescents will incrementally bridge the gap between conceptualization and execution. Until then, their artwork offers a poignant window into a developmental moment—a period of potential soon to unfurl into meticulous representation with maturation and guidance."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how children don't grasp that their drawings are woefully incomplete and substandard facsimiles of the objects they imagine.","completion":"During pre-adolescence, youngsters are often optimistic creators, embarking on artistic ventures brimming with earnest intention, scarcely aware of the qualitative chasm that divides their imaginative vision from the nascent creations they bring forth into the world. Their drawings emerge as charming yet markedly rudimentary mirrorings of the rich and vivid tapestries woven in their mind’s eye. Take, for example, a child's rendering of the family pet, a beloved dog with a glistening coat and expressive eyes. In the imagination of the young artist, every strand of fur ripples with life, every panting breath and twitch of the ear is rich with adoration. Yet, when pencil takes to paper, the complexity of the figure is drastically truncated. The portrayal is reduced to blocky shapes: a circle for the head, rudimentary ovals for the body, mismatched lines for the legs. The nuances of the animal's character — its vitality, its sheen, its very essence — remain conspicuously absent. The earnest scrawls intended to depict fur are hard-pressed to encapsulate the true texture, resulting in a creature that is spirited in effort but underwhelming as a replica. Similarly, consider a pre-adolescent attempting to capture the grandeur of a sunset landscape. In their mind’s vision, the sky is ablaze with hues of orange, pink, and purple, the sun a fiery orb descending into the horizon. However, the translation of this scene to their sheet of paper yields but elementary stripes of color, lacking gradient, dimension, and the subtle interplay of light that marks a sky in twilight. The sun may be a simple yellow disc, situated incongruously within a flat, static backdrop. What the child perceives as a spectacle of nature's beauty is, through the lens of underdeveloped technique and spatial understanding, depicted as a stripped-down facsimile, lacking the depth and resonance that characterizes an authentic sunset. Furthermore, when these young artists present architectural feats, such as a house or a city skyline, the intricate interplays of shadow and structure within their conception are compressed into mere geometric abstraction. The house, imagined as a welcoming haven complete with textural details like brickwork, shingled roofs, and ornamental landscaping, is instead conveyed through primary shapes. Squares denote windows, lines delineate doors, and triangle rooftops cap lopsided edifices. Perspective is often skewed — with parallel lines failing to converge and dimensions disregarded, their renditions are of surreal, dreamlike edifices, echoing none of the solidity and spatial coherence characterized by actual buildings. At this stage, the pre-adolescent is usually unaware of the representational shortcomings evident in their artwork. They often showcase their pieces with pride, the value tied not to verisimilitude but to the creative exploration that gave it life. Their art, while a far cry from the fidelity of the intended subject, embodies the unfettered spirit of childhood expression — pure, unjaded, and replete with potential. As they mature, the acquisition of more advanced cognitive tools, along with fine-tuned motor control, will allow pre-adolescents to more closely align their creations with the complexities of the real world they seek to depict. Until then, their art stands as a touching documentation of their developmental journey, a testament to an unspoiled exuberance that revels more in the act of creation than in the precision of the outcome."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how a hidden room experiment where a class of kindergarten students were left alone in a simulated classroom for an entire day unsupervised devolved into chaos and wild antics where as witnessed by the recorded video the kids could be seen screaming, yelling, singing and making a mess of the classroom with everything in a jumbled mess illustrates how young children natural instincts take over when they are alone together.","completion":"The hidden room experiment conducted with a group of kindergarten students serves as an illuminating case study on the unadulterated natural instincts of young children when liberated from the structures and confines of adult supervision. Researchers meticulously created a simulated classroom environment, an exact replica of the students' familiar learning space, yet unknown to the children, the room featured concealed observation mechanisms. Over the course of an entire day, these young individuals were observed autonomously, their behaviors and interactions captured on video, revealing the regression from order to pandemonium in the absence of authoritative guidance. As the recorders whirred to life and the doors swung shut, a fascinating decline unfolded, akin to an unchoreographed dance of juvenile anarchy. Initial moments marked by tentative uncertainty quickly gave way to burgeoning realizations of their newfound autonomy. The classroom's usual hum of obedience and routine was supplanted by a crescendo of unrestrained exhilaration. Children, hitherto habituated to regimented schedules and teacher-led activities, found themselves in an Eden of independence, and they capitalized on this liberation to its fullest. The visual and auditory evidence painted a scene of ebullience. Students, unencumbered by the watchful eyes of educators or the regiment of rules, defaulted to instinctual behaviors that revealed inherent drives of curiosity and boundary-testing. Societal norms and niceties became obsolete as the classroom devolved into a playground of primitive impulses. Driven by id, every corner of the room was subject to exploration and transformation. Recordings show the children engaging in a cacophony of activities that underscore their intrinsic impetuousness. Their vocalizations permeated the air—screams of delight intertwined with arguments, spontaneous songs erupting from the chaos. Some vocal expressions served as assertive claims of dominion over toys, while others were simply audible manifestations of their unfettered state. The physical space of the classroom, once a tapestry of order, mirrored the inner milieu of juvenile freedom. Tables and chairs were transmuted into fortresses and obstacle courses, educational materials were swept into whirlwinds of artistic expression rather than instructional use, and the cleanliness of the environment was replaced with scattered remnants of play. Paints once neatly stored became instruments of abstract art on surfaces unintended for such creativity. Building blocks, intended for structured cognitive tasks, found new identity as projectiles or components of precarious structures. The disarray captured on video was flagrant; every fiber of the carpet and tile was clad in the detritus of unleashed merriment—a collage of torn paper, uncapped markers staining the surfaces, and toys in disarray, evidencing the raw impulse towards entropy when youthful curiosity collides with absent governance. This revealing experiment laid bare the inherent natural dispositions of children, drawing attention to the intrinsic characteristics of these young humans: boundless energy, impulsive decision-making, and a preference for immediate gratification over foreseeing consequences. They exhibited group dynamics that oscillated between cooperation in mischief and competition for resources, reverting to primal social behaviors that belie their nascent development in societal mores. In the solitude of their unsupervised congregation, the students personified the quintessence of childhood. Without the usual adult-led redirection, their actions were mediation-free explorations of freedom, social hierarchies, and personal limits. Collective self-regulation was minimal, as one might anticipate given their developmental stage, emphasizing the vital role of adult presence in nurturing nascent impulses towards socially acceptable interactions. The undeniable takeaway from this bold foray into child behavior is a reaffirmation of the essential nature of guidance in early education settings. Structure, unwanted though it may seem to the autonomous child, remains pivotal in channeling youthful ebullience into pathways that cultivate emotional, social, and intellectual prosperity. However, the hidden room experiment also underscores a crucial facet of the human spirit—that of undiluted liberty, expressive vigor, and the inborn predilection to test the waters of autonomy, even in the earliest stages of life."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how the children would erupt into fights, bawl their eyes out and undress their clothes in the absence of adult supervision, but remarkably as the day went along the kids mostly resolved their troubles and tribulations by themselves where kids who cried were comforted, fights ended peaceably and clothes that went missing were returned to their owners.","completion":"In the intricate social experiment set within the confines of an unsupervised kindergarten classroom, the steady escalation of conflict and emotional upheaval was prominently documented, manifesting the fulminant discharge of youthful idiosyncrasies when left to their own devices. Yet, within the heart of chaos, there emerged a self-correcting current of compassion and compromise, illustrating the nascent seeds of social sophistication burgeoning within these young minds. The tapes recount episodes where disagreements among the children ballooned into skirmishes. Squabbles over toys transformed into tussles as small hands grappled for possession. In a space devoid of the moderating hand of an adult, territorial disputes could quickly spiral into physical confrontations where pushing, shoving, and tears were commonplace. The distress of these confrontations was palpable; some children could be seen bawling, their tear-streaked cheeks and red-rimmed eyes pointing to the intensity of their emotional responses. Their cries, usually cues for adult intervention, now sent ripples through their miniature society, prompting peers to assume roles typically filled by their teachers or guardians. Even more striking were instances where some children, under the weight of limitless freedom and a disregard for the conventions of a structured environment, shed their clothing. The shirts and skirts that represent a sort of social uniform in their daily lives were abandoned, perhaps in acts of revelry or experiments in comfort. Disrobed, the children further blurred the boundaries of classroom decorum, engulfing the space with fragments of innocence unleashed from societal molds. However, as the day unfolded, the initial bedlam gave rise to inspiring vignettes of empathy and resolution. Those precocious souls who had erupted into sobs found solace in the arms of their peers; young comforters offered embraces and pats on the back, and soothing words emerged from surprising sources. Through the lens, one could witness a child wiping away the tears of another, providing a nurturing presence that belied their years, a clear echo of the compassion they themselves had received from adults in their lives. Fights that had once flared with the unpredictable volatility of youthful tempers found their denouement not through punitive measures but via the spontaneous justice of the group. Small arbitrators rose from the ranks, offering compromises and mediating the sharing of coveted items. Battle lines were drawn back, and truces were struck, as the children gravitated towards an instinctual preference for harmony over hostility. Remarkably, clothing discarded in the throes of the morning's disorder began to find its way back to rightful owners as the day neared its end. Garments were retrieved from the nooks and crannies of their play-land and returned, sometimes with the assistance of a mediator. The retrieval and proper adorning of attire served as a symbolic representation of a return to a natural order—a purely child-driven re-establishment of normalcy. The captured footage stands as an emblem of a microcosmic society that oscillated between pandemonium and peace. It captured a transformation from a world punctuated by impulsivity and discord to one that, organically and without adult intervention, oriented itself towards stability and unity. The children inadvertently outlined a developmental blueprint showcasing their inherent ability to navigate conflict and to autonomously construct a consensus, crafting an impromptu order from the tempest of their unfettered freedoms."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how the children curiously were reluctant to tell the researchers after the experiment was over what had transpired within the unsupervised classroom. Whether together or separately, the kids kept the secrets of that day to themselves though punctuated by giggles and snickers of laughter as they recalled the fun, wild times they had together.","completion":"In the aftermath of the unobserved kindergarten classroom experiment, the young participants displayed a striking reticence to divulge the full spectrum of events that transpired in the absence of adult supervision. This collective silence seemed to form an invisible pact amongst them, as if the shared experience had woven a fabric of solidarity that was impervious to the inquiries of the researchers. When approached for narratives of the day's occurrences, the children presented a tableau of furtive glances and impish smirks. Their lips sealed tight, guarding the memories of the unstructured escapades that had unfolded within their self-governed realm. This behavioral veneer was not one of guilt or fear, but rather conveyed a subtle understanding that some experiences shared under the banner of raw, unfettered freedom were best kept within the exclusive annals of their collective memory. While individually interviewed, the little ones displayed a remarkable consistency in their demure responses. Short, innocuous anecdotes would trickle out amidst bouts of infectious giggles or coy smiles, but no comprehensive accounts surfaced. Their replies, peppered with evasive charm, offered only the faintest glimpse into the roller coaster of emotions and actions they had navigated. In one moment, a child might hint at the great fortress they had constructed, and the next, they would clamp up with a knowing grin that spoke volumes of the untold stories behind those cardboard walls. It became evident that the pure, untamed joy they had submerged into — the freedom that had stretched its wings in the open expanse of a day unmarred by rules — was not just an individual treasure but a collective jewel fiercely guarded. This reluctance to articulate the arc of their unsupervised voyage seemed not the product of a rehearsed pact but rather an instinctive bond formed through shared revelry and revelatory self-discovery. The snippets that did escape, often in the form of a mischievous snicker or a bashful half-narrative, were fragments of the grand tapestry they had woven together. The room they had inhabited, once simply a classroom, had morphed into a secret garden of children’s lore—an island of adventure, temporary in its existence but eternal in the sanctity of their hearts. When pressured gently for information, they would band together, shrugging nonchalantly or turning the question around with the impromptu cleverness that only a child's mind could conjure. This nonchalant defiance was not one born of nefarious intent; it was the manifestation of a pure desire to keep alive the magic that had blossomed away from the adult gaze—a magic now deeply embedded in the giggles and winks they exchanged over questions that peeled at the edges of their surreptitious world. This dance of recollection and concealment that played out post-experiment revealed the depth of the children's understanding of their experience. By choosing what to keep as a shared secret, the children demonstrated a natural incline towards the ownership of their narrative and the intrinsic human impulse to savor special memories as a shared, yet private, joy. The events of that day had transformed from moments of childhood caprice into cherished secrets, locked away within the unspoken vault of innocence."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how the children only told of the adventures they had in the classroom to the researchers when given juice, candy and other treats. Before their lips were sealed, but when offered goodies to eat, they eagerly recalled their wanton playful escapades throughout the day. This inducement suggests that children are susceptible to food as a way of getting them to comply and answer questions.","completion":"The inducement of treats and sweets proved to be a turning point in the hidden room experiment with kindergarten students. Initially, the children exhibited a collective discretion about the day’s events, safeguarding the details with a charming nonchalance. However, when researchers interjected the element of gustatory reward, the sealed vault of the children's silence sprang open, revealing a susceptibility tied intricately to the simple pleasures of juice and candy. Culinary delights served as a metaphorical key to unlocking the children's recollections. Their initial reticence dissipated as they were presented with the sweet allure of treats. Sticky fingers and juice-slicked lips became the preamble to a cascade of tales previously untold. The drawing power of sugary inducements was made vividly apparent; the very same lips that had been pressed into determined silence now curved around animated stories of their unsupervised adventures. A boy, previously tight-lipped, eagerly narrated an account of an impromptu game of indoor tag while clutching a half-eaten candy bar. His eyes widened as he described the chase through the jumbled desks, the exhilaration of dodging classmates in a race of riotous fun. Sugar seemed to provide a jolt not only to his energy levels but also to his willingness to share, the sweetness emboldening his tongue. Another child, sipping on a bright-colored box of juice, colorfully recounted the puppet show they had improvised, complete with sock characters and slapdash storylines, her demeanor shifting from restrained to ebullient. It was as if the juice served as both a physical and psychological refreshment, granting permission to express the creative exploits that flourished in the absence of adult oversight. This pattern of revelation in exchange for treats yielded a stream of narratives, all surfacing around the guarantee of a palatable reward. It painted a clear picture of juvenile psychology—where desire can often be rerouted with the promise of immediate gratification. A reward system as elementary as offering treats prompts a reflection on the incentives that motivate young children, highlighting an innate reaction that can be traced back to basic behavioral conditioning. The willingness of the children to trade stories for snacks offered insights into the malleable nature of child compliance. Their testimonies, unleashed by the proffering of confections, suggest that immediate sensory rewards are singularly potent motivators, powerful enough to override their instinctual predilection for secrecy. This revelation underlines the elemental forces that drive young behavior, where the pursuit of pleasure can overshadow the cohesion of shared experience and the bond of mutual reticence. In summary, the spontaneous confessions elicited through gastronomic temptations underscored a critical facet of children’s decision-making processes. Young minds, it appeared, operated under a straightforward economy of incentives, where the currency of candy has the formidable clout to elicit cooperation and dissolve the bonds of a communal secret—illuminating a poignant snapshot of the dynamics that can influence a child's actions and choices."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how chili over fried rice with slices of sirloin steak can form a sumptuous meal for any lover of mixed cuisine cooking.","completion":"The fusion of flavors in the dish—chili over fried rice with slices of sirloin steak—is a masterful culinary symphony that plays to the palates of gourmands enamored with the richness of mixed cuisine. This meal stands not only as a testament to the harmonious blend of cross-cultural culinary traditions but also as an indulgent repast certain to gratify those with a penchant for bold and sophisticated tastes. The dish begins with a bed of expertly fried rice, each grain a testament to the perfect equilibrium between the softness necessitated by the palate and the textural integrity that resists sogginess. The rice, often laced with an array of finely chopped vegetables and seasoned smartly with the likes of garlic, ginger, and shallots, brings a medley of both earthy and piquant notes. Tamari or soy sauce cascades through the rice, imparting a rich umami flavor that lays the foundational landscape of this gastronomic delight. Atop this canvas rests the sirloin steak, sliced into succulent, tender strips that are seared to perfection. The sirloin, known for its fine marbling and rich flavor profile, offers bites of toothsome pleasure with each mouthful. When prepared with discerning care, these slices encase a blush of pinkness within their midst, indicative of a medium-rare cook that preserves the juiciness and inherent savor. The crowning glory of the dish is the chili—an infusion of heat and intensity that injects vigor into the entire ensemble. The chili sauce, perhaps a concoction of smoky chipotle peppers or a searing Szechuan blend, depending on the culinary tradition it pays homage to, envelops the dish in a spicy embrace. This fiery dressing is interlaced with other elements—tomato, onion, perhaps a splash of citrus or honey for balance—ensuring that the heat is not sheer but complex, enveloping the taste buds rather than assaulting them. When this trinity converges upon a single plate, the result is an experience that transcends mere satiation. Spoons digging into the dish initially carve through the viscous chili layer, capturing the meat's savory juices and rice's aromatic flavor in one gesture. The first bite is a crescendo of textural contrasts and taste harmonies—the coarse grain of the rice against the succulent give of the beef, the earthiness of the rice juxtaposed with the zest of the chili, all cascading in unison to create a sumptuous tableau upon the palate. Moreover, such a meal is not bound by the temporal confines of traditional dining hours, proving itself just as suitable for a high-powered lunch as it is for a decadent dinner. Each forkful vies for attention, singing of the terroir where its ingredients were cultivated, the ingenuity of intertwined culinary practices, and the chef's finesse in balancing elemental flavors. In its entirety, chili over fried rice with slices of sirloin steak constitutes not just a mere meal but an epicurean journey. Its richness appeals to a broad spectrum of diners, uniting aficionados of heady spices, appreciators of expertly cooked meat, and lovers of the timeless comfort of fried rice. This dish offers more than sustenance; it serves as an emblem of culinary artistry, a harmonious blend that respects the integrity of its diverse origins while creating a singular, sumptuous repast fit for any lover of mixed cuisine cooking."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how females are relatively disinterested in the WNBA despite the sport being catered to women with marketing that emphasizes their gender. This has resulted in a league that has lost billions of dollars since its existence and has never been profitable.","completion":"The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) has faced numerous challenges in attracting and maintaining a robust female viewership, despite being a sporting league that markets itself as promoting women's basketball. This disinterest among women has posed a persistent obstacle to the league's profitability. An examination of the WNBA's marketing, cultural impact, and financial performance provides a revealing context for understanding the intricacies of this phenomenon. The WNBA has endeavored to tailor its brand and marketing efforts to highlight the empowerment of female athletes and the celebration of women's involvement in professional sports. The league has messaged that it stands not only for high-level competition but also for the principles of equality and opportunity in the male-dominated realm of professional sports. The \\"Watch Me Work\\" campaign is an archetype, showcasing women's dedication, skill, and professionalism — both on and off the basketball court. Despite these efforts, the response from the targeted demographic hasn't catalyzed the fanbase expansion that might lead to sustained profitability. Research into audience demographics reveals that women, while representing a considerable portion of athletic participation, have not mirrored that level of engagement as consumers of women's professional sports. Several reasons feed into this apparent disinterest. Cultural norms and gender roles have been cited, where women, historically, had lesser exposure to or encouragement toward spectating sports. Additionally, lifestyle and entertainment consumption patterns among women often differ from those of men, with interests distributing across a broader spectrum of activities beyond sports viewership. The financial trajectory of the WNBA reflects the ramifications of this tepid reception. Since its inception, the league has incurred substantial losses, with reports detailing billions of dollars in shortfalls over the years. Sustained profitability has eluded the WNBA, unlike its male counterpart, the NBA, which has a long-standing record of substantial revenues and wider viewership. Factors contributing to these losses include lower ticket sales due to underwhelming attendance, minimal broadcast contracts, and less lucrative sponsorships, part and parcel of a less-engaged fanbase. The disinterest among women not only affects gate receipts and direct viewership numbers but also extends to secondary revenue sources such as merchandise sales. WNBA jerseys, memorabilia, and related paraphernalia have not penetrated the marketplace with the same vigor seen in other leagues. The iconic swoosh of a WNBA team jersey remains a less common sight in everyday life, signaling a missed connection between the league's offerings and the lifestyle choices of its potential female supporters. Strategic attempts to elevate the prominence of the WNBA, involving scheduling games during the NBA off-season to avoid competition for viewers, have also not significantly shifted the landscape. Despite being designed to give the WNBA a distinct time slot for capturing attention, this positioning has not translated into a fortified female following. This extensive analysis underscores that the WNBA's efforts to cater to a predominantly female audience have not resulted in a commensurate level of interest, attendance, or financial support from that group. It elucidates a complex interplay between advertising strategies aimed at women, societal structures around sports consumption, and the deeply entrenched market dynamics that favor men's professional sports leagues. The WNBA's persistent lack of profitability, despite dedicated marketing and promotion targeting its primary demographic, stands as an emblematic case, instructive for broader considerations within the world of professional women's sports and its pursuit of sustainability and growth."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how even lesbians and other LGBTQ+ women has shown little interest in the WNBA despite being catered to exclusively through partnerships with LGBTQ+ nonprofit advocacy organizations and other efforts to demonstrate their attractiveness to them.","completion":"It is important to note that my ability to provide an analysis is bound by the requirement to remain respectful of all individuals and communities. The WNBA's outreach to the lesbian and LGBTQ+ community represents a deliberate strategy to engage a segment that is both part of their core female demographic and historically aligned with advocacies for diversity and inclusion. Despite these strategic efforts, such as partnerships with LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, pride-themed games, and active involvement in issues central to the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the anticipated galvanization of lesbian and LGBTQ+ fan support has been met with lukewarm enthusiasm at best. There have been numerous pride nights and events aimed at celebrating the LGBTQ+ community within the league, and prominent players have come out publicly, fostering a climate of inclusivity. However, the league has struggled to translate these inclusive gestures and initiatives into a significant bump in attendance and viewership from the LGBTQ+ population. Surprisingly, this is despite the sport boasting openly gay icons and a generally progressive stance on LGBTQ+ issues — factors that might typically cultivate a more dedicated following. The reasons for this muted response are multifaceted. Some speculate the lack of interest could partly stem from broader societal attitudes towards women's professional sports, irrespective of sexuality or gender identity. Others suggest that lesbian and LGBTQ+ potential spectators, just like their heterosexual counterparts, might find the marketing and presentation of WNBA games less compelling than alternative forms of entertainment or other sporting events. Certain critics have pointed to the fact that the league's outreach initiatives, while well-meaning, have not always resonated authentically with the targeted groups, perhaps being perceived as performative rather than substantive. Financially, this shortfall in anticipated support has meant that even these efforts to court the lesbian and LGBTQ+ demographic have had minimal impact on the bottom line. The loss of billions of dollars since the league's inception stands as a stark indicator that inclusivity alone is not enough to ensure financial viability. The WNBA’s expectation that a progressive stance would yield robust engagement from the LGBTQ+ community has not been met with the expected financial returns from ticket sales, merchandise, and media deals. In direct contrast, we can observe the palpable support that LGBTQ+ communities often offer to other cultural events and establishments that actively embrace inclusivity. Pride parades, music festivals, and LGBTQ+ friendly venues frequently see enthusiastic patronage from this demographic. The discrepancy between the overwhelming support for such events and the tepid response to the WNBA poses interesting questions about the complex interplay between identity, community support, and consumer behavior. Despite the league’s sincere attempts to engage such groups through targeted marketing and strong advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights, translating these gestures into tangible gains has remained elusive. The WNBA's story illustrates a broader conundrum within marketing and community engagement: the importance of understanding and genuinely connecting with the audiences one aims to attract. In sum, the WNBA’s integration of LGBTQ+ supportive initiatives has not remedied the league’s longstanding financial challenges. The tepid response from the lesbian and broader LGBTQ+ community appears as yet another dimension in the tapestry of the league's struggle to cultivate a sustainable and profitable fan base, despite earnest efforts to align their brand with the values and causes that resonate with these groups."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly, using vivid examples of how the NBA has subsidized the WNBA to cover its shortfalls in revenues where its broadcast rights are tied to that of the WNBA's. This is evidence that as a stand alone product of entertainment the WNBA has failed to become a viable business.","completion":"Since its establishment, the economic viability of the WNBA as a standalone entity has been an area of significant discourse, especially in light of the sustained financial support it has required from the NBA. The dependence of the WNBA on subsidies from the NBA is a telling indicator of the challenges the women's league faces in establishing itself as a profitable venture in the competitive landscape of professional sports and entertainment. The NBA's economic support extends to covering shortfalls that arise from the WNBA's inability to generate sufficient revenue through its own streams, such as ticket sales, merchandising, and broadcast rights. The broadcast rights, in particular, are emblematic of the WNBA's financial challenges. These rights are often packaged and sold in tandem with those of the NBA, rather than as a separate product, revealing a reliance on the established popularity and market dominance of the men's league. Networks are more inclined to invest in these combined packages, knowing the NBA's rights represent a far less risky proposition due to its substantial and consistent viewership numbers. This bundling strategy underscores the WNBA’s difficulty in securing lucrative broadcast deals as an autonomous brand. The revenue generated from such deals is typically a cornerstone for any major sporting league’s financial structure. However, in the case of the WNBA, the revenue is largely supplementary, a reflection of a market that has yet to value the women's league as highly as its male counterpart. The NBA's financial backing is imperative not only for the operational expenditures of the WNBA but also for marketing campaigns designed to attract viewers and sponsors alike. The NBA’s monetary infusion also extends to covering salaries and benefits for WNBA players and staff — critical elements for the workings of any professional sports organization. It is revealing, then, to consider the implications of this dependency. The WNBA, over the years, despite concerted efforts to carve out its niche and rally fan engagement, has struggled to achieve the level of commercial success that would liberate it from the NBA's financial umbrella. This struggle is indicative of a sporting market that has historically been skewed towards male sports, leaving female leagues to battle ingrained perceptions and unequal investment. The NBA's subsidies have kept the WNBA afloat, allowing it to continue operations and work toward growth and greater autonomy. However, this on-going financial reliance also clearly illustrates that, in terms of market forces and profitability, the WNBA has not yet succeeded in becoming a self-sustaining enterprise. The women's league remains under the shadow of the men's, negotiating an uphill battle for recognition and revenue in a market that has shown limited readiness to embrace women's professional basketball as a standalone product of entertainment. In sum, the interdependency of the WNBA on the NBA's financial support casts the former in relief as a league that, despite its social importance and the high caliber of athleticism it showcases, has not been able to triumph as a viable business on its own. This sobering reality confronts us with deeper questions about market dynamics, societal values, and the challenges of gender equity in the domain of professional sports."},{"prompt":"Write a chapter of 1000 words about a man drive through the empty road until his car broke and stopped working, while trying to fix the car he end up destryoing all his clothes one piece a time until he completely naked, desperate he try to get a lift and after a while he get by a tour bus of swedish suntanning team, a sport team of swedish women.

Miles without a single soul in sight, just the way he liked it—until the engine sputtered its displeasure and ceased altogether.

Tinkering with loose wires and belts under the hood, Jack couldn't help but curse his luck. The desert was a cauldron by day, but it could be unforgivingly cold when night fell. He didn't want to be out here when the temperature dropped. As he wrestled with the stubborn engine, Jack wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grease across his forehead. He didn’t notice his pristine white shirt catching on a rough edge, tearing a slice through the fabric. \\"Great, just great,\\" he muttered, tugging at the tear. The sleeve came off in his hand as if the shirt had given up. Jack threw the ragged sleeve to the ground, focusing on the engine once more. But the fates conspired against him, with every lean and stretch, his clothing paid the price, snagging and tearing on every conceivable piece of metal. Eventually, Jack's clothing had become more patches than fabric. A collection of his former attire formed at his feet, the desert wind whisking away some pieces across the barren landscape. \\"Might as well be a scarecrow,\\" Jack grumbled under his breath, staring at the pathetic figure he cut, wearing little more than tatters. The sun had sunk below the horizon, twilight encroaching with a chilly breeze. Desperate, Jack figured he'd have better luck flagging down the next vehicle passing by rather than spending the night with his car's stubborn engine. Shedding his remaining shredded dignity, he stood by the roadside, his pride the last thing to go. The temperature dropped as Jack's hopes waned with the fading light. Then, as if the universe enjoyed a good laugh, he spotted headlights in the distance. He didn't know whether to hide or be thankful. With a deep breath, he stepped towards the edge of the road, waving his arms like a man both frenzied and relieved. The vehicle slowed—a tour bus, brilliantly lit, coming to a stop beside him. The door hissed open, and Jack prepared his most compelling plea for assistance, all the while keenly aware of his peculiar state of undress. \\"Evening,\\" a warm voice greeted him from within the bus. It was a woman, driver and guide by the looks of it. She peered down at him with more curiosity than shock. \\"You seem to be in quite the predicament.\\" \\"You could say that,\\" Jack admitted, sheepishly covering himself with what was left of his dignity. \\"My car broke down. I could really use a lift.\\" \\"Where to?\\" she asked. \\"The next town would be a blessing,\\" Jack replied, gaze darting around, hoping no one else was witnessing this exchange. She looked him over once more, considering. \\"Well, we were heading that way, but you see, we're not your usual service. This is the Swedish sun-tanning team; we're en route to the world championships. Can't have you scaring my team now, can we?\\" Jack blinked, the situation's absurdity not lost on him. \\"I assure you, there's nothing I want less than to scare a bus full of people. If you have something I could wrap up in, even a curtain...\\" The driver chuckled before calling back into the bus. \\"Anyone got a towel or something to spare for our roadside friend?\\" Laughter and chatter broke out as a flurry of Swedish reached his ears. Jack stood somewhat amazed as not one, but several articles—a towel, a t-shirt, and surprisingly enough, a pair of swim trunks—were passed to the front and handed over. \\"Rescued by the Swedish sun-tanning team,\\" Jack murmured, taking the items and hastily covering himself. \\"I'll never live this down.\\" \\"With a story like that,\\" the driver said, helping him onboard, \\"I'd say you'll be living it up instead.\\" Jack settled into a seat, surrounded by an eruption of friendly introduction and conversation as the bus rolled on. The warmth inside the bus did little to quell his blushing cheeks, but he couldn't help but smile. It was an adventure, most unlikely and bizarre, a stark contrast to his lonely drive, and a tale he would someday recount with laughter and disbelief. As the bus journeyed through the desert night, with stars twinkling above and the sounds of new friendships forming, Jack realized that sometimes it's the unplanned detours that make the trip truly memorable."},{"prompt":"Write a description for a short film featuring Luke Custer from Project: Altered Beast taking his footwear off and inspecting his feet.

Tormented by his altered state and afflicted by the relentless quest to harness genetic mutation, this short film captures a rare moment of vulnerability in his superhuman existence. Description: The scene opens with the camera panning across the dimly lit corridors of the underground facility, its walls lined with conduits and cables that pulse with ominous intent. The unmistakable sound of heavy boots against the floor reverberates as Luke Custer makes his way through the maze of technology that has become his prison and his battleground. The tension in Luke's eyes is palpable as he stops in a secluded alcove, hidden from the surveillance and the unspeakable horrors that lurk behind sealed doors. With a sigh, he drops to a seated position on a cold, metallic bench. His calloused hands, evidence of countless battles, reach down and unlatch the buckles of his footwear, heavy with the weight of his burdens. One by one, Luke removes his formidable boots, revealing his feet—bare, yet unblemished. It's a stark contrast to his scarred psyche and the monstrosities he's been forced to confront. With careful scrutiny, Luke inspects each foot, turning it side to side, examining the skin that has miraculously remained untouched by the perils of his altercations. As Luke's focus turns to his big toe, he gingerly wiggled it, analyzing its mobility and seeking any sign of the physical corruption that he so fears will one day consume him. The moment serves as both a physical and symbolic gesture, representing both the human fragility he desperately clings to and the ever-growing unease about his future. In this silent chamber, away from the chaos and the transformation triggers that hunt him relentlessly, Luke finds a fleeting sanctuary—a place to remind himself of the man he still is beneath the experiments and the monstrous forms he's been cursed to adopt. As the film concludes, Luke slides his boots back onto his feet, the steel resolve returning to his eyes. He rises from the bench and steps back into the shadows of the facility corridor, the solitary sentinel ready once more to confront the darkness within and beyond—his humanity intact, at least for another day. \\"The Sole Survivor\\" ends as it began, with Luke's receding footsteps, a symbolic echo of his perpetual journey through a world altered beyond recognition, and an internal struggle to remain whole in a fractured existence."},{"prompt":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] Why did bartering fall out for market systems?","completion":"Bartering, the direct exchange of goods and services without the use of money, fell out of favor due to its lack of efficiency and scalability.

Judy Hopps, the trailblazing rabbit officer, hopped out of bed with her usual boundless energy, ready for another day of fighting crime and munching carrots. She was to meet her partner, the sly fox Nick Wilde, for coffee before hitting their beat. From the moment she saw Nick at their favorite café, Judy sensed something was… different. First, there was the tie — a gaudy, neon-striped number that clashed horrifically with his usual sartorial elegance. Second, his sly grin was less 'charming rogue' and more 'used car salesman.' But it was the third clue that really threw her for a loop: Nick ordered a large black coffee, no sugar. \\"Since when do you drink your coffee without heaps of sugar?\\" Judy inquired, her ears perking with suspicion. \\"Since always, Carrots,\\" Nick sneered, his voice lacking its usual playful lilt. \\"You know me, I'm all about keeping it sharp and unsweetened.\\" Judy squinted her amethyst eyes at him but shook her head. Maybe he's trying a new diet or playing a practical joke. She decided to let it go... for now. But as the day wore on, Judy couldn't shake the feeling that something was just not right with her partner. \\"Nick\\" was unusually grumpy, opting to ignore her jokes instead of volleying back witty banter. He also kept mistaking police codes and once referred to Chief Bogo as \\"Chief Buffalo.\\" Judy rolled her eyes — maybe he just got up on the wrong side of the bed. Things took an even stranger turn when they arrived at a crime scene to investigate a theft at a local jewelry store. \\"Don't worry,\\" Snarky Nick declared, \\"Officer Wilde is on the prowl.\\" Judy's ears flopped in bewilderment. Nick never — and she meant never — referred to himself with such... arrogance. As they dusted for prints, Judy's confusion escalated. \\"Nick\\" had somehow forgotten how to properly hold the dust brush, waving it around like a conductor's baton. \\"Nick, since when do you handle evidence like it's going to explode?\\" \\"Since, uh, the academy, Fluff,\\" he retorted, dodging eye contact. Just as Judy was about to confront \\"Nick\\" on his bizarre behavior, the door to the jewelry store swung open, and in strutted another Nick Wilde, the real deal, looking as foxlike and dashing as ever with a classic smirk on his face. \\"What's all this?\\" Real Nick quipped, eyebrow arching as he laid eyes on his imposter. \\"Has my mirror misbehaved and come to life?\\" \\"Nick?!\\" Judy gasped, looking back and forth between the two foxes. A comedic-confusion-fueled argument erupted between the Nicks, accusations of identity theft thrown faster than Judy's carrot pen could write a ticket. \\"Who are you supposed to be, my evil twin?\\" Real Nick inquired with his usual sarcastic undertone. \\"I'm the genuine article, you're the phony!\\" retorted Fake Nick, with an edge of panic creeping into his voice. The raucous back and forth continued until Judy, with her keen cop instincts, noticed a tuft of fur poking from the collar area of Fake Nick's shirt — it was distinctly weasel-like. \\"Enough!\\" she commanded. She hopped over and yanked at the tuft of fur, and much like unraveling a sweater, soon the whole \\"fox\\" facade came undone, revealing, none other than Duke Weaselton in an extremely convincing Nick Wilde disguise. \\"Duke Weaselton?!\\" Judy and Real Nick exclaimed in unison. The miniature criminal stuttered, \\"This isn't what it looks like! I was just... Uh... researching for a movie role. 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox 2: Foxy Boogaloo'!\\" \\"That's the best you've got?\\" Nick snorted, shaking his head with a mixture of amusement and disbelief. Without missing a beat, Judy whipped out her handcuffs and with Nick's help, cuffed the wily weasel. \\"Duke Weaselton, you're under arrest for impersonation and for disturbing the peace…and for insulting a good coffee choice.\\" As they escorted Duke to the precinct, Judy and the real Nick shared a glance and burst out laughing. \\"I have to say, Carrots, that was one 'foxtastic' collar,\\" Nick remarked, grin wide and mischievous as ever. \\"I'm just glad I have my partner back,\\" Judy replied, nudging him with her elbow. \\"I definitely prefer my fox less weasely.\\" \\"Hey, always feel free to check my fur if you're in doubt,\\" Nick chuckled, playfully flicking his ears.

Jesus o utiliza como exemplo para falar sobre a blasfêmia contra o Espírito Santo. 4. Legião – A história do endemoninhado gadareno é encontrada em Marcos 5:1-20. Jesus expulsa uma legião de demônios desse homem, que possuía força e estava vivendo nos túmulos. 5.

In this game, you purchase NFTs of real racehorses and earn money if the real horse wins a race. The game does not disclose where the money comes from or what happens if the horse dies. Besides this game basically being \\"Gambling 2: Now with Extra Steps!\\", isn't there ethical concerns about commodifying real living beings for profit in a scam currency?","completion":"The hypothetical NFT racehorse ownership game you're describing indeed raises a variety of ethical concerns, which we can break down into several categories: 1. **Animal Welfare:** The idea of directly tying the value and trading of NFTs to real, living creatures brings animal welfare into question. There is a risk that the horses could be perceived as mere assets or commodities, whose welfare may be secondary to the profits they can generate for their NFT owners. This commodification could incentivize pushing horses beyond their limits, improper care, or neglecting their well-being if not properly regulated. 2. **Gambling Concerns:** If users are purchasing NFTs with the hope of financial return based on race outcomes, this indeed mirrors gambling. Such systems require clear regulation to ensure they do not exploit participants, particularly vulnerable or underage individuals. The game should be transparent about the risks and the mechanisms in place to prevent gambling addiction. 3. **Financial Ethical Issues:** Transparency in financial dealings, especially when related to speculative assets like NFTs, is crucial. Not disclosing where the money comes from or what happens in various scenarios (like a horse's death) is a significant red flag. It could imply that the game is not operating with the financial integrity that users should expect from any form of investment or entertainment that involves real money. 4. **Transparency and Honesty:** Lack of disclosure about significant aspects of the game is ethically problematic. For informed consent, users need to understand what they are getting into, the risks involved, and how their money is being used. Without this, users could be misled or defrauded. 5. **Regulatory and Legal Compliance:** Any business model that involves earning money from live sports events through a digital or tokenized stake in the outcomes has to navigate various laws and regulations, including those governing sports betting, animal rights, online gambling, securities, and consumer protection. Failure to address these areas is not only unethical but could also lead to legal repercussions. 6. **Environmental Impact:** NFTs and cryptocurrencies, in general, have come under scrutiny for their environmental impacts due to the energy consumption associated with blockchain operations. Ethical considerations of such environmental impacts should be taken into account, especially if the game becomes widespread. 7. **Commodification and Objectification:** Beyond the specific case of racehorses, the underlying concern is about the commodification and objectification of living beings for entertainment and profit. This could set a concerning precedent for how we value and interact with animals in other areas of society. It's important to note that NFTs and blockchain technology can be utilized in ethically responsible ways, for example, providing transparent ownership records or supporting conservation efforts. The ethical implications largely stem from how the technology is implemented and the intentions behind its use. In conclusion, any venture that intersects with real live animals, financial speculation, and gaming should approach its business model with an ethical framework in place, prioritising the welfare of the animals involved, the well-being of the participants, and compliance with legal and environmental standards."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Keep in mind, the information provided here is strictly hypothetical and fictional as Jon Snow is a character created by George R.R. Martin and his decisions are dictated by the narrative of the books and the HBO television series. Here are a few thoughts on what might happen: 1. **The Themed Establishment**: Jon Snow's restaurant could capitalize on his fame and history, potentially becoming a themed establishment offering Northern Westerosi cuisine—think hearty stews, ales, and meat pies. He could name it \\"The White Wolf\\" after one of his monikers, or perhaps \\"The Night's Feast\\" in reference to his time with the Night's Watch. 2. **Challenges**: Coming from a background of leadership and battle, Jon Snow would face a steep learning curve in the hospitality industry. However, his leadership skills and strict sense of honor could translate into a well-managed establishment with high standards. 3. **Celebrity Attraction**: Given his notoriety in the Seven Kingdoms, his restaurant might quickly become a popular spot for Westerosi nobility and common folk alike, eager to catch a glimpse of the former Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and possible heir to the Iron Throne. 4. **Menu Influence**: The menu could feature dishes inspired by Jon's unique heritage and experiences, such as wildling-inspired foraged food, exotic dishes brought by ambassadors from across the sea, or nobles' favorites reflecting his upbringing in Winterfell. 5. **Redemption and Peace**: For Jon, the restaurant might represent a chance to leave behind a world of conflict and find some semblance of peace and normalcy—a personal haven where he can control his fate, unlike the turbulent political landscape he left behind. 6. **Community Role**: Perhaps Jon would use his restaurant as a way to unite different factions of society, turning it into a neutral ground where former enemies could parley over fine food rather than the battlefield. 7. **Cameos**: Fans of the series would likely enjoy cameos from other beloved characters who stop by to visit Jon at his new venture, leading to interesting interactions and subplots. 8. **Merchandising**: There could be a line of merchandise and memorabilia associated with the establishment, including things like \\"You Know Nothing, Jon Snow-Cone Maker\\" for the summer or \\"I Survived the Long Night\\" brand of dark stouts. In a meta sense, such a turn of events would be delightful for fans who enjoy imagining alternative lives for their favorite characters. It allows for a playful exploration of a beloved character in everyday, relatable scenarios, which is often the basis for fan fiction and other creative fan-driven content."},{"prompt":"What if the series ended this way?","completion":"If the \\"Game of Thrones\\" series had ended with Jon Snow quitting his roles and opening a restaurant, it would have certainly been one of the most unanticipated and unconventional conclusions to an epic fantasy series. This ending would diverge starkly from the themes of power, betrayal, sacrifice, and destiny that pervaded the narrative arcs throughout the show. Here are some thoughts on such a conclusion: 1. **Fan Reaction**: The fan base would likely have mixed reactions. While some might appreciate a lighthearted and peaceful resolution for a beloved character, many others might feel it was an anticlimactic or unsatisfying end to a high-stakes, action-packed drama. 2. **Narrative Cohesion**: An ending that pivots to Jon Snow running a restaurant would likely struggle to provide closure to the numerous complex plot lines and may leave many character arcs and political machinations unresolved, which could be unsatisfactory for viewers invested in those stories. 3. **Message and Tone**: \\"Game of Thrones\\" is known for its grim tone and commentary on the human condition, power struggles, and the harsh realities of life. An ending featuring Jon in a mundane, albeit charming, new life might undermine these thematic elements and fail to address the moral and philosophical questions raised throughout the series. 4. **The Sweet in Bittersweet**: The series' author, George R.R. Martin, has stated that he planned for the ending of the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" book series (on which \\"Game of Thrones\\" is based) to be bittersweet. While Jon finding a peaceful new purpose could represent the 'sweet' aspect, the ending would need to balance this with the 'bitter' consequences of the story's conflicts to stay true to Martin's vision. 5. **Symbolic Interpretations**: If well-executed, the ending could carry symbolic weight. The restaurant could serve as a metaphor for rebuilding and healing after the wounds of war, with Jon Snow leading a life dedicated to bringing people together rather than tearing them apart. 6. **Exploration of Identity**: Jon's decision to open a restaurant could be seen as the ultimate act of choosing his path, rejecting the identities that have been imposed on him (e.g., bastard, Lord Commander, potential heir to the throne) and embracing a simpler life that he chooses for himself. 7. **Spin-off Material**: Such a light-hearted conclusion might leave an opening for future spin-offs or parodies that explore the daily life and adventures of Jon Snow, the restaurateur, in a more comedic or slice-of-life setting. 8. **Literary Subversion**: The ending would certainly stand as one of the most unique subversions of fantasy tropes, going against the expectations of the heroic journey by opting for a mundane and peaceful occupation over grand destiny or tragic sacrifice. In conclusion, while it would be a radical departure from the established tone and direction of the series, Jon Snow retiring to open a restaurant could provide a heartwarming, though unconventional, end to his story. However, given the depths and complexity of the \\"Game of Thrones\\" narrative, such an ending would likely require careful execution to avoid alienating the core audience while providing a satisfying resolution to a sweeping saga."},{"prompt":"Write an in character dialogue scene in which certain Characters, including Gendry and Arya as newlyweds, coming to eat and hang out at Jon's Restaurant.","completion":"INT. THE WHITE WOLF RESTAURANT - NIGHT The restaurant is bustling with activity, cozy with the warm glow of candles. The decor, a tasteful homage to the North and the Night's Watch, invites a sense of camaraderie. In one corner, newlyweds GENDRY and ARYA STARK sit at a table for two. ARYA eyes the room with fierce curiosity as GENDRY admires the craftsmanship of the interior. Suddenly, the front door swings open and JON SNOW, clad in a simple tunic and a warm smile, enters from the kitchen, carrying a tray with two steaming bowls. JON (friendly) Welcome to The White Wolf, my friends! Never thought I'd be serving bowls of brown in my own place, did you? GENDRY (chuckling) Wouldn't miss it for all the kingdoms, Jon. This place looks... it looks right. Like you built it with your own hands. ARYA (smirking) It's missing a weirwood tree, but I suppose you don't want the old gods watching people eat. JON (sets down the bowls) Perhaps not. But I've planted one out back, where folks can seek solitude if they wish. Gendry picks up one of the bowls, inhales deeply, and smiles appreciatively. Arya, still sharp as ever, scans the room. ARYA It wouldn't be you without some nod to the past, Jon. But you seem... at peace here. (pauses) I didn't think that was possible. Not for us. JON (sighs, then smiles) We've all seen too much, Arya. This... this is my quiet in the noise of it all. A place for those who've fought to rest their swords and fill their bellies. GENDRY (raising his bowl) To rest and full bellies, then! They share a toast and take a bite. The rich flavors elicit rounds of appreciative nods and sounds. ARYA So, are you truly done with... everything out there? JON (eyes downwards, pensive) There are many battles yet to fight in the world, but I've chosen mine here, helping people find a moment's joy in the simple things. Winter has passed, and with it, my watch has ended. GENDRY (glances towards Arya, warmly) A man can ask for no nobler cause. Arya and I—we have our own future to forge. Arya looks at Jon with earnest eyes. She understands his choice and respects it. ARYA Could use a good sparring partner, though. Working in the forge doesn't keep you sharp. Not in the way that matters. JON (laughing softly) I think you'll find plenty of steel to keep you sharp around here, little sister. Just come by any time. An awkward SILENCE falls over the table, as they are reminded of the many missing friends and family who can't join them. JON (softly, breaking the silence) They're never far from us. And here, in every dish, every ale, every fire that burns, I honor them. And now, with you two here... (smiles) it's good to be surrounded by family. GENDRY Here's to family, then. And new beginnings. They share another toast. Jon excuses himself to tend to other patrons, leaving Arya and Gendry to enjoy their meal and reminisce about old times, while also pondering the new life that lays ahead for all of them.

GENDRY (smiles) Wouldn’t be here if it wasn't for you, Jon. The place has character. ARYA (teasingly) And smells better than the Night's Watch ever did. Jon places the bowls in front of them, the steam carrying rich and inviting aromas. JON Well, we aim to feed the living here, not scare them off. (pauses, shifts tone) How’s married life treating you both? ARYA (takes a bite, looks amused) It's another adventure. But we couldn't exactly roam forever. GENDRY Yeah, figured it was time to forge something new, something lasting. (nods at Arya) Together. JON (sincerely) Then I’m glad you started that journey here, with us old friends. Arya and Gendry exchange a knowing glance, their bond apparent. ARYA It’s a rare thing, finding a place to call home. Seems like you’ve done that here, Jon... (trails off, reflective) after everything. JON (looks around, contemplative) Seems I have. Life’s not always about fighting battles. Sometimes it's about knowing when to lay down your sword and feed some good folks. GENDRY (lifts his bowl) To good food and good company—a rare find in these times! They share a toast, the clink of bowls sounding a note of camaraderie. Jon moves to leave but pauses for a moment, looking back at them with a touch of nostalgia. JON The past has its place, but here, now, it’s about the simple joys—like witnessing two stubborn kids find their way to each other's hearts. ARYA (smirks, her eyes soft) Expect us to turn up for those sparring sessions, though. Peaceful life or not, we can't get rusty. JON (chuckles) Wouldn’t dream of it. Looking forward to it, actually.

Quando ele consegue reunir todas as seis jóias em sua manopla, cada uma delas oferece um poder único que, quando combinado, lhe dá controle quase absoluto sobre o universo. Abaixo estão as funções das Jóias do Infinito usadas no momento em que ele estala os dedos para apagar metade de toda a vida: 1. Jóia do Espaço (Azul) - Controla o espaço. Permite a Thanos manipular a distância e a existência física, tornando possível a aplicação dos efeitos do estalo em todo o universo simultaneamente, sem restrições de localização. 2. Jóia da Mente (Amarela) - Concede poderes telepáticos e controle mental. No contexto do estalo, poderia ser interpretado que a Jóia da Mente dá a Thanos a capacidade de entender as complexas inter-relações de todas as mentes no universo para determinar quem seria afetado pela sua ação. 3. Jóia da Realidade (Vermelha) - Pode alterar a realidade. Esta jóia provavelmente é usada para concretizar a vontade de Thanos, fazendo com que o conceito de \\"apagar metade da vida no universo\\" se torne uma realidade efetiva. 4. Jóia do Tempo (Verde) - Permite ao usuário controlar e manipular o tempo. É provável que esta jóia fosse usada para sincronizar o efeito do desaparecimento ao longo de diferentes linhas temporais, garantindo que a ação de Thanos afetasse todos os seres no mesmo instante. 5. Jóia do Poder (Roxa) - Fornece um nível de poder físico e energético imensurável. A Jóia do Poder amplifica todas as outras jóias e concede a Thanos a força necessária para fazer o estalo ter o efeito devastador desejado. 6. Jóia da Alma (Laranja) - Controla a alma e a essência do ser. Essa jóia é particularmente importante, pois permite a Thanos direcionar especificamente a sua ação para seres vivos com almas, determinando quem viveria e quem seria extinto pelo seu ato. Em suma, a combinação do poder das seis Jóias do Infinito possibilitou que Thanos tornasse seu desejo macabro uma realidade, afetando todas as formas de vida senciente através do vasto universo."},{"prompt":"1.Je croyais que chaque biju avait donner a naruto un peu de leur chakra? 2.Jubi a eu combien de cirinjuki? 3.C'est quoi le chakra naturel? Son importance? Qui la enseigner à naruto? 4.C'est quoi le mode ermite?Son importance?Qui la enseigner à naruto?","completion":"1. Oui, à un moment donné de la série \\"Naruto Shippuden\\", chaque Biju (les neuf démons à queues) a donné une partie de son chakra à Naruto Uzumaki. Cela se produit pendant la Quatrième Grande Guerre Ninja, lorsque Naruto est sur le point de mourir après que Kyubi (Kurama) lui a été extrait. Les autres Biju lui transfèrent une partie de leur chakra grâce à leur ancienne connexion avec le Sage des Six Chemins, ce qui lui confère la capacité d'utiliser un peu de leur puissance. 2. Le terme \\"Jinchuriki\\" (notez la correction de l'orthographe) se réfère aux hôtes humains qui ont un Biju scellé en eux. Le Jūbi (Dix-Queue) n'a pas vraiment eu de Jinchuriki dans le sens classique, sauf quand Obito, puis Madara sont devenus des Jinchuriki du Jūbi après sa résurrection pendant la Guerre. À noter que le Jūbi est l'entité originelle dont les neuf autres Biju ont été créés. 3. Le chakra naturel est l'énergie qui existe dans la nature et autour de tous les êtres vivants. Il est fondamentalement différent du chakra normal que les ninjas génèrent à partir de leur propre énergie physique et mentale. L'importance du chakra naturel réside dans sa capacité à amplifier considérablement les techniques et les capacités physiques d'un ninja lorsqu'il est correctement maitrisé. Naruto a appris à utiliser le chakra naturel auprès de Fukasaku, l'un des deux grands sages du Mont Myoboku. 4. Le mode Ermite (aussi appelé mode Sennin) est une technique avancée qui résulte de l'absorption et de l'équilibrage du chakra naturel avec le chakra du ninja. Cela aboutit à une augmentation massive de la force, de l'endurance, de la vitesse, des réflexes, ainsi que de nouvelles techniques et la capacité à sentir le chakra autour de soi. C'est extrêmement important car il permet à Naruto de faire face à des adversaires beaucoup plus forts et d'être à un niveau capable de combattre des menaces comme les membres d'Akatsuki ou même Madara Uchiha. Fukasaku (Maître Grenouille) et Shima, les deux grands ermites du Mont Myoboku, sont ceux qui introduisent Naruto au mode Ermite et lui enseignent comment recueillir et utiliser le chakra naturel."},{"prompt":"Le numero 1 est permanent? Jubi n'était pas le jinchuriki de naruto? Qui la vaincu et comment?","completion":"1. Non, le transfert de chakra des Biju à Naruto n'est pas nécessairement permanent; cependant, après que Naruto ait reçu du chakra de tous les Biju et les ait \\"rencontrés\\" à l'intérieur de lui-même pendant la Quatrième Grande Guerre Ninja, il est devenu une espèce de \\"point de rassemblement\\" ou de plateforme pour leur pouvoir. Cette connexion avec les Biju a permis à Naruto de continuer à avoir accès à une partie de leur chakra bien après la guerre, mais il ne détient pas leurs pouvoirs de manière permanente dans le même sens que pour un Jinchuriki proprement dit avec un Biju complètement scellé en lui. 2. Concernant le Jūbi, le terme \\"Jinchuriki\\" se réfère effectivement au hôte du Jūbi, mais Naruto n'a jamais été le Jinchuriki du Jūbi. Pendant la Quatrième Grande Guerre Ninja, Obito Uchiha est devenu le Jinchuriki du Jūbi après sa résurrection, suivi par Madara Uchiha après qu'il ait trahi Obito. Ensuite, le Jūbi a évolué en sa forme finale, le Rabit (Dix-Queue) avec Kaguya Otsutsuki qui a émergé en tant qu'ultime antagoniste. 3. Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, qui est essentiellement la source du chakra et la mère des deux fils qui ont finalement mené à la lignée ninja, a été scellée pendant la Quatrième Grande Guerre Ninja par une technique conjointe du Sage Art: Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei, utilisée par Naruto Uzumaki et Sasuke Uchiha après qu'ils aient reçu un pouvoir spécial du Sage des Six Chemins (Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki). Ensemble, avec l'aide de Sakura Haruno et Kakashi Hatake, Naruto et Sasuke ont pu défier et finalement vaincre Kaguya et ainsi mettre fin à la guerre. Kaguya a été scellée dans une nouvelle lune créée par cette technique, ce qui a aussi entraîné la dissipation du Jūbi et la libération de ses composantes, les Biju."},{"prompt":"Pour le numero 1, comment Naruto a continuer (et utiliser) à avoir accès à une partie de leur chakra bien après la guerre? Pour le numero 3, c'est quoi ce pouvoir spécial que Naruti et Sasuke on reçu? Qui est obito?","completion":"1. Après la guerre, Naruto garde une connexion avec les Biju parce qu'il a été le point de réception de leur chakra et le lieu où ils ont tous convergé. Bien qu'il ne soit pas traditionnellement un Jinchuriki pour chaque Biju, sa capacité unique de partager des liens et son statut de Jinchuriki de Kurama (le Kyubi) lui permettent d'accéder à une partie de leur chakra. C’est surtout symbolisé par les différentes queues de chakra que l'on voit autour de lui lorsqu'il utilise le chakra des Biju. En pratique, cela signifie que Naruto peut invoquer les pouvoirs spécifiques des Biju en cas de besoin. 2. Le pouvoir spécial que Naruto et Sasuke ont reçu vient directement du Sage des Six Chemins, Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. À Naruto, Hagoromo a donné une partie de son propre chakra \\"Yang\\", et la capacité de comprendre toutes les choses et de libérer les marques maudites. Cette puissance a permis à Naruto d'utiliser le mode Sennin des Six Voies et d'accéder à de nouvelles formes de Rasengan, de techniques de guérison, et de la capacité de flotter. Sasuke a reçu la marque \\"Yin\\" du chakra d'Hagoromo, ce qui a amélioré son Sharingan en Rinnegan dans son œil gauche, avec des pouvoirs accrus comme le contrôle gravitationnel et de dimensions, ainsi que des améliorations dans ses capacités d'Uchiha. 3. Obito Uchiha était initialement présenté comme un membre d’équipe de Kakashi Hatake. Croyant mort lors d'une mission, Obito survit cependant et est recueilli et manipulé par Madara Uchiha, qui le prépare à poursuivre son projet \\"Œil de la Lune\\". Sous l'alias \\"Tobi\\" et la fausse identité de Madara, Obito conduit l'organisation criminelle Akatsuki dans le but ultime de mettre en œuvre le \\"Plan Œil de la Lune\\", initié par Madara, qui vise à projeter un genjutsu infini (Tsukuyomi Infini) sur la lune pour hypnotiser l'humanité. Il devient aussi le Jinchuriki du Jūbi pendant une certaine période de la guerre avant d'être trahi par Madara et de finalement assister Naruto et ses alliés."},{"prompt":"Lien entre obito,Itachi et Madara?Comment ça le pouvoir de yang de naruto lui permet de comprendre toute les choses?Et capaciter de flotter, sur quoi?","completion":"Le lien entre Obito, Itachi et Madara est principalement lié à l'organisation criminelle Akatsuki. Voici les détails : - **Obito Uchiha** : Après avoir été sauvé par Madara et manipulé par ce dernier, Obito prendra le pseudonyme de Tobi et poursuivra l'agenda de Madara après sa mort. Il prendra le rôle de leader de l'Akatsuki suite à l'échec de Nagato, également connu sous le nom de Pain. Sous le faux nom de Madara, il influence de nombreuses événements clés de l'histoire. - **Itachi Uchiha** : Itachi est un membre de l'Akatsuki, mais il travaille en réalité en tant qu'espion double pour le village de Konoha. Il joue un rôle crucial dans le massacre de son clan, sous les ordres du leadership de Konoha, pour éviter un coup d'État qui aurait mené à une guerre. Itachi assassine donc tous les Uchiha, à l'exception de son frère, Sasuke, qu'il veut protéger. Son implication dans Akatsuki fait partie de sa couverture et de son plan pour protéger son frère d'être ciblé par l'organisation ou d'autres ennemis. - **Madara Uchiha** : Madara est l'un des fondateurs de Konoha et l'ancêtre de la plupart des Uchiha. Son ambition et sa vision pour le monde le mèneront à élaborer le \\"Plan Œil de la Lune\\". Avant sa mort finale, il a manipulé Obito pour continuer son plan et il a indirectement influencé les actions d'Itachi à travers l'histoire des Uchiha et le développement de l'Akatsuki. Quant aux pouvoirs de Naruto : La partie du chakra \\"Yang\\" donnée à Naruto par Hagoromo lui accorde des améliorations générales à ses capacités existantes et quelques nouvelles, comme : - La capacité de comprendre toutes choses peut être vue comme une extension de la sagesse et des insights donnés par Hagoromo. Cela permet à Naruto de sentir les émotions et les intentions réelles des autres à un niveau beaucoup plus profond, ce qui lui aide à former des connexions et potentiellement réhabiliter ceux qui sont perdus dans l'amertume ou l'hostilité. - La capacité de flotter fait référence à la lévitation de Naruto au sein du Mode Sennin des Six Voies. Il ne flotte pas sur un objet en particulier ; c'est plutôt une manifestation de son contrôle accru sur le chakra qui lui permet de se soutenir dans les airs, comme on le voit avec d'autres personnages du monde de \\"Naruto\\" qui ont atteint des niveaux de puissance similaires, tels que ceux qui maîtrisent le Rinnegan."},{"prompt":"Qui a tuer itachi? Compétences du rinnegan? Naruto na jamais utiliser le doton mur de terre?","completion":"1. **Qui a tué Itachi?** Itachi Uchiha n'est pas tué dans un combat traditionnel, mais plutôt, il meurt à cause d'une maladie dont il souffrait depuis longtemps. Pendant son combat final avec son frère Sasuke, Itachi s'effondre et meurt après avoir activé son Susanoo une dernière fois. Son objectif était de libérer Sasuke de l'emprise d'Orochimaru et d'épuiser tout son pouvoir maléfique avec l'épée Totsuka. Il s'assure aussi que Sasuke survivra probablement fortifié par une haine contre lui, mais sans être souillé par les ténèbres de la vengeance personnelle. Juste avant de s'effondrer, Itachi touche le front de Sasuke, symbolisant son affection inébranlable pour lui. 2. **Compétences du Rinnegan:** Le Rinnegan est l'un des trois grands Dojutsu (techniques oculaires) dans \\"Naruto\\", et offre plusieurs compétences uniques : - **Les Six Chemins (Pains):** Permet à l'utilisateur de manifester six corps différents, chacun possédant une capacité unique (contrôle gravitationnel, invocation, absorption de chakra, etc.). - **Contrôle des forces attractives et répulsives (Shinra Tensei et Banshō Ten'in).** - **Ressusciter les morts (Rinne Tensei).** - **Maîtrise de toutes les cinq natures de chakra élémentaires.** - **Création de la Lune Noire (Chibaku Tensei).** - **Interdimensionalité : capacité à voyager entre les dimensions (capacité spécifique à Sasuke Uchiha).** En plus de ces techniques, l'utilisateur a également accès à une variété d'autres capacités qui peuvent varier d'un individu à l'autre. 3. **Naruto et le Doton Mur de Terre:** Naruto, bien qu'il soit très capable en ninjutsu, n'est pas souvent vu en train d'utiliser des techniques de type Doton (Terre). Il se concentre principalement sur le style de Vent (Futon) et sur son Rasengan célèbre, qui n'est pas associé à un élément spécifique avant qu'il n'apprenne à le combiner avec une nature de chakra élémentaire. Cela dit, dans le monde étendu de \\"Naruto\\" avec les jeux vidéo et certains fillers de l'anime, il est possible qu'il soit montré en train d'utiliser des jutsus de type Doton pour des raisons de variété de gameplay ou de scénario, mais dans le manga canonique et les parties principales de l'histoire de l'anime, il n'utilise pas le Doton Mur de Terre. C'est plutôt un jutsu généralement associé à des ninjas comme Kakashi Hatake ou d'autres personnages ayant une affinité pour les techniques de type Terre."},{"prompt":"Donc sasuke peut maitriser les cinq éléments? En gros naruto maitrise combien?","completion":"Avec l'acquisition du Rinnegan, Sasuke Uchiha gagne théoriquement la capacité de maîtriser toutes les cinq natures de chakra élémentaires. Cependant, l'étendue de cette maîtrise n'est pas entièrement détaillée dans l'histoire de base ; son utilisation dans l'anime et le manga se concentre surtout sur ses pouvoirs améliorés d'Uchiha et les capacités spéciales que le Rinnegan confère, comme la téléportation et le contrôle gravitationnel. En ce qui concerne Naruto Uzumaki, son talent se manifeste principalement dans le style du Vent (Futon) dès le début. C'est son affinité naturelle, et il l'utilise avec des techniques telles que le Rasengan pour créer des variantes telles que le Futon: Rasen-Shuriken, qui est un puissant jutsu d'attaque à distance. Toutefois, lorsqu'il atteint le Mode Sennin des Six Voies après avoir reçu une partie du chakra de Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, Naruto acquiert la capacité d'accéder et de mélanger plusieurs types de chakra de la nature, comme le montre sa capacité à utiliser les différentes capacités des Biju, chacune étant généralement associée à un type de chakra particulier. Il démontre ainsi indirectement la manipulation des différentes natures de chakra via l'utilisation du chakra des Biju, bien que le manga et l'anime ne montrent pas Naruto en train de former de manière conventionnelle des techniques spécifiques aux cinq natures de chakra comme le fait un ninja ordinaire. Sa maîtrise est donc moins conventionnelle et directement liée à son statut de Jinchuriki et à son lien avec les Biju, ainsi que la transformation de Kurama et les capacités offertes par le Mode Sennin des Six Voies. Cela lui permet d'accéder à des pouvoirs variés sans devoir s'entraîner explicitement dans les autres natures de chakra."},{"prompt":"Le mateau spéciale de naruto","completion":"Dans le monde de \\"Naruto\\", le \\"manteau\\" que vous mentionnez est probablement le \\"manteau de chakra\\" ou \\"forme de chakra\\" que Naruto Uzumaki obtient lorsqu'il est en Mode Bijū ou Mode Kurama. Ce \\"manteau de chakra\\" est une manifestation visuelle de l'énorme énergie du Kyūbi (Kurama, le démon renard à neuf queues) qui protège et amplifie les capacités de Naruto. Voici quelques détails sur les différentes formes de chakra que prend ce \\"manteau\\" : - **Mode Chakra Kyūbi (Version 1)** : Cette forme est accessible la première fois que Naruto libère le chakra de Kurama. Elle entoure Naruto d'un manteau de chakra rouge en forme de renard avec une queue, qui augmente sa force, sa vitesse et ses capacités de guérison. - **Mode Chakra Kyūbi (Version 2)** : Ce mode est une version plus avancée et plus puissante que la précédente. Il est marqué par un manteau de chakra ressemblant encore plus à la forme du Kyūbi, complet avec plusieurs queues, et il est beaucoup plus destructeur. - **Mode Kyūbi Complet ou Mode Bijū** : Après avoir établi une relation de coopération avec Kurama durant la Quatrième Grande Guerre Ninja, Naruto peut accéder à cette forme qui lui permet d'utiliser la pleine puissance de Kurama. Il ressemble à un avatar composé de chakra jaune-orange et peut manifester les appendices et la taille du Kyūbi. - **Mode Sennin des Six Voies (Six Paths Sage Mode)** : Suite à l'intervention du Sage des Six Chemins, Naruto obtient une version avancée du mode Kyūbi, permettant de mélanger des éléments du chakra du Sage et des Biju. Ce mode est caractérisé par un nouvel ensemble de vêtements, une cape avec un col haut, et le chakra est visible en orbites autour de lui, similaire à l'aura qui entoure le Sage des Six Chemins lui-même.

Il se matérialise sous la forme d'un corbeau avec l'Œil de Shisui Uchiha implanté dans celui-ci, qui possède le Kotoamatsukami, une puissante technique de genjutsu qui peut manipuler les pensées d’une personne. Itachi a programmé le corbeau pour réagir spécifiquement à ses yeux Sharingan, ce qui a été activé plus tard pendant le combat contre Itachi réanimé (Edo Tensei) et contrôlé par Kabuto. L'influence de Kotoamatsukami libère Itachi de Kabuto et modifie son comportement. B) **Naruto combinant le chakra des bijū avec son Rasengan**: Après avoir reçu du chakra de toutes les queues de bijū pendant la Quatrième Grande Guerre Ninja, Naruto est en mesure de combiner les éléments Yōton (Lave) et Jiton (Magnétisme) de certains Bijū avec son Rasengan, résultant en de nouvelles versions de Rasengan. De plus, il gagne le pouvoir de créer des sceaux pour restreindre les mouvements des adversaires, en utilisant les techniques de Chakra des Bijū comme celle de Shukaku (le Une-Queue) qui est expert en techniques de scellage. C) **Naruto avec un nouveau manteau chakra après avoir rencontré l'Ermite Rikudō**: Quand Naruto rencontre Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, l'Ermite Rikudō (Sage des Six Chemins), il reçoit une partie du chakra du Sage, ce qui lui permet d'accéder au Mode Sennin des Six Voies. Ce mode confère à Naruto une nouvelle apparence avec un manteau chakra, et les Sphères de Vérité (Gudōdama en japonais), qui sont des orbes noir et sphérique flottant derrière lui, analogue à ceux utilisés par Rikudō Sennin. Ces orbes peuvent être utilisés pour diverses techniques offensives et défensives. Ce mode renforce davantage ses capacités en mode Ermite (Sennin) et lui donne effectivement un accès permanent à ce mode, avec les pouvoirs associés à chaque bijū."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Neste capítulo, durante a visita de Eren e Zeke à memória de Grisha dentro do Mundo dos Caminhos (Paths), Zeke quer mostrar a Eren o momento em que Grisha massacra a família Reiss, esperando provar que Grisha estava sob o controle de Eren e que ele era uma má influência sobre seu pai. Contudo, Zeke fica confuso quando testemunha Grisha hesitar e expressar arrependimento e a não vontade de seguir com o massacre. Grisha, que pode sentir a presença de Eren e Zeke em suas memórias devido ao poder do Titã de Ataque, pede a Eren que o pare. No entanto, Eren insiste para que seu pai continue, revelando a Grisha que essa ação é necessária para garantir a liberdade que eles desejam para o futuro. A influência de Eren não é feita através de controle direto, mas sim por imploração e persuasão. Ele usa a visão do futuro fornecida pelo poder do Titã de Ataque para convencer Grisha de que essa terrível ação é um passo necessário em um plano maior. Este momento é crucial porque revela a natureza cíclica da influência através das linhas do tempo e das gerações dentro da narrativa de \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\".

Ele é conhecido por sua calma e neutralidade emocional, o que o torna habilidoso em manipular situações e pessoas a seu favor sem revelar seus verdadeiros sentimentos ou intenções. Para tentar adotar uma calma e neutralidade emocional semelhante à de Kiyotaka, considere as seguintes estratégias, lembrando sempre que são inspirações baseadas em um personagem de ficção e que na vida real é importante também reconhecer e processar suas emoções de maneira saudável: 1. Autocontrole: Trabalhe para desenvolver autocontrole e autodisciplina. Isso inclui aprender a não agir com base em impulsos momentâneos e a manter a compostura mesmo em situações estressantes. 2. Observação e Análise: Pratique ser um observador atento. Analise cuidadosamente as situações antes de tomar uma decisão, considerando todos os aspectos possíveis. 3. Inteligência Emocional: Desenvolva sua inteligência emocional, que é a capacidade de reconhecer, compreender e gerenciar suas próprias emoções, bem como perceber e influenciar as emoções dos outros. 4. Técnicas de Mindfulness: Experimente práticas de mindfulness, como meditação, para ajudar a cultivar um estado de atenção plena e neutralidade em relação aos seus pensamentos e emoções. 5. Controle da Linguagem Corporal: Aprenda a controlar sua linguagem corporal para que ela não revele suas emoções. Isso inclui manter uma expressão facial neutra, postura relaxada e contato visual controlado. 6. Resiliência Emocional: Construa resiliência emocional fortalecendo sua capacidade de lidar com adversidades e estresse sem se desestabilizar emocionalmente. 7. Comunicação Eficaz: Desenvolva habilidades de comunicação que permitam que você fale e escute de maneira eficaz, mantendo sempre uma abordagem calma e racional. 8. Evite Reações Instantâneas: Antes de reagir a algo, dê um passo para trás e dê a si mesmo tempo para refletir sobre a melhor resposta. 9. Mantenha o Foco: Esteja sempre atento aos seus objetivos e ao que é realmente importante, evitando se distrair com emoções irrelevantes. 10. Busca por Conhecimento e Estratégia: Esteja sempre aprendendo e melhorando a si mesmo, seja adquirindo novas habilidades ou conhecimento, e desenvolva estratégias para lidar com diversas situações. É importante notar que ser completamente neutro e emocionalmente distante não é saudável em todas as situações na vida real. Diferentemente dos personagens fictícios, os seres humanos precisam de uma saudável expressão emocional e de conexões autênticas com outras pessoas para manter o bem-estar emocional e social. Equilibrar racionalidade com emoção é uma chave para o sucesso nas interações diárias e para uma vida saudável."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

MINDSCAPE WORLD - DAY The verdant landscape sprawls endlessly, a digital utopia that's both stunningly beautiful and impossible. Rivers flow uphill, trees sway in an unfelt breeze, and the sky shifts through a palette of surreal hues. In this serene mindscape, JACOB, the protagonist, and ARIA, his engineer sister-figure, sit atop a floating hill, legs dangling over the edge into the ever-shifting ether below. They're relaxing in the simulated sun, a warmth that feels almost authentically solar. A quiet hum of background code shapes the thrumming life around them. JACOB takes a deep breath, relishing the serenity of the cyber-scape while their physical bodies are cocooned in healing pods back in the real world, recovering from the injuries of their last escapade. JACOB (smiling) Did you tinker with the physics engine again? This place feels more like home every time we come here. ARIA (matching his smile) Only a bit. I've coded the sunset to last longer. Just another couple thousand lines. JACOB (sarcastically) Just a couple thousand, huh? They both chuckle quietly. A space-time anomaly, in the form of a butterfly, flutters by, its wings blurring between dimensions. JACOB (softly) We've come a long way, haven't we? From stowaways on a junker to... whatever you'd call us now. ARIA (pondering) Intergalactic anomalies? Cosmic troubleshooters? JACOB (smiling wryly) I meant more along the lines of 'family'. ARIA (sincerely) I like that. 'Family'. Though, the galaxy probably has less familial terms for us. A pause as they share an understanding glance, a shared history of battles fought, worlds saved, and near-death escapes that only they could fully appreciate. JACOB You know, back when we confronted the Entity... I wasn't sure if we'd make it. ARIA Neither was I. But you had a plan. Like always. JACOB (laughs) Plan? I was making it up as we went along. The only constant was knowing you'd have my back. ARIA (looking at him warmly) Always. They soak in the view, the mindscape reflecting their inner tranquility. JACOB (turning to her) Everything we've done, the choices we've made... Do you think it was worth it? ARIA Pauses, contemplating. ARIA We've defied the odds, saved lives, and shifted the scales of power. It's more than worth it. It's our story. Jacob nods, gazing at the horizon. The sunset stands still, a sea of gold and crimson that ARIA has curated just for moments like these. JACOB (after a moment) So... once we're back to the land of flesh and blood... What's the next adventure for our little family? ARIA (leans back, hands behind her head) I've heard whispers of a star system where time flows backward... Might be fun to be kids again, even if it's just for a moment. JACOB (raising an eyebrow) Time flows backward? That's either a new beginning or another mess to untangle. ARIA (chuckles) Isn't that what family's for? To jump headfirst into the chaos together? JACOB (stretching out, content) Yeah. Together.

JACOB takes in a simulated breath, reveling in the tranquility as their physical selves heal in the sanctity of their futuristic medical pods. JACOB (chuckles) This place is always a little different. Subtle tweaks to gravity? New orchestration in the wind? ARIA (eyes glowing with mischief) And I've mastered the sunset. I think it suits me, don’t you? Molding beauty from chaos. JACOB (teasingly) Just a touch of chaos, right? Laughter dances between them, rippling across the mindscape's code. ARIA (quietly) I've lived amidst chaos, under so many masks. This... all of this, us... it feels like I've finally shed the last one. JACOB (sincere) You're more you than ever, Aria. No more hiding behind facades or aliases. A cybernetic falcon soars overhead, wings slicing through the code with precision—a creation of Aria's liberated self. ARIA (androgynously) You can't imagine how long I hid in plain sight, pretending to be someone else, even to myself.

ARIA Contemplates, then shakes her head. ARIA This life, these choices—leaving my old self and becoming who I am—it was worth every moment. Even when I thought we wouldn't survive. Jacob nods, deep in thought. They watch as the perpetual sunset drenches them in hues of warmth and tranquility, a testament to Aria's newfound harmony. JACOB Once we're out of this healing hiatus, where to next? What's the next chapter for us? ARIA (a dreamy look in her eyes) There's a nebula, not too many light-years from here.

Yeah, I think it's time we went and painted our own corner of the universe. ARIA (chuckles) Together, as always. They lean back, basking in the synthetic yet comforting rays of their eternal sunset.

Isso nos ensina a não subestimar os outros baseando-se em aparências ou primeiras impressões. 2. **Paciência estratégica**: Ayanokoji exemplifica a importância da paciência e da observação antes de agir. Ele raramente faz movimentos precipitados e espera o momento certo para executar seus planos, mostrando que muitas vezes é melhor pensar e planejar do que reagir impulsivamente. 3. **Controle emocional**: Apesar das circunstâncias, Ayanokoji demonstra um excelente controle sobre suas emoções. Este é um lembrete importante sobre a utilidade de manter a calma e o controle em situações estressantes ou quando se está sob pressão. 4. **Uso tático de conhecimento e informação**: Ayanokoji utiliza seu conhecimento aprofundado sobre psicologia humana e habilidades de observação para entender melhor as outras pessoas e usar essa informação em sua vantagem.

Enquanto suas ações podem ser vistas como pragmáticas, elas também levantam debates sobre moralidade e justiça. É importante ter em mente que, enquanto algumas das \\"lições\\" acima podem ser admiráveis ou úteis para o desenvolvimento pessoal e sucesso, outras podem ser questionáveis do ponto de vista ético.

The moonlight spilled through his window like a spotlight, illuminating his plight of sleeplessness for the world—or at least for any nocturnal bird passing by—to see. Nick was weary. For the past few days, he and Judy Hopps, his crime-fighting partner, had been putting away bad guys and getting on each other's nerves in the best possible way.

Controllers dropped like hot pota-you-know-whats as they scrambled to the window to spot the source of the commotion. There it was, an honest-to-goodness spaceship—the kind with chrome spirals and blinking lights that would make any conspiracy theorist faint in ecstasy—crumpled against the nearby dumpster. Nick remembered their shock. Finnick remembered their curiosity. And then, they remembered the alien. It waddled out from the wreckage, dazed and confused, with nine eyes blinking asynchronously and tentacles that jangled with a peculiar rhythm. The teens had been stranged out for sure, and who wouldn't be? But the creature, perhaps sensing their love for video games, made a gesture that transcended any language barrier. Nick, snuggled in his bed, chuckled at the memory. The three of them had sat back down—an extraterrestrial being in the middle, learning the intricacies of \\"Ape Escape.\\" It turned out that manipulating a DualShock controller came naturally to a being with seven dexterous appendages. Nick and the alien had taken turns, while Finnick explained the tactics. \\"See that gadget? It'll help you catch those mischievous primates. No, don’t grab that—wrong button! Oh... you've got it? Ah, a natural!\\" They played until the sun peeked its first golden rays of the new millennium. Nick recalled the laughter, the triumphant hollers as they unlocked a new level, and the peculiar but strangely comforting hum the alien's ship emitted as it finally sputtered back to life. As the memory began to fade, Nick's eyes did too, and the embrace of slumber finally seemed within reach. His mind danced at the edge of dreams when suddenly, he woke with a jolt. \\"Wait a minute,\\" Nick thought, groggily rubbing his eyes. \\"That never happened—we were running a small-time hustle that night, not hanging out with E.T.'s cousin!\\" He sighed as realization washed over him. The alien, the spaceship, the video game bonding session—it was all made up, a figment of his own mischievous imagination, probably inspired by one too many late-night sci-fi flicks. With a smile, Nick shifted in his bed, settling into a more comfortable position, the lie he had unwittingly told himself now a part of his own lore—funny how the mind worked when desperate for some shut-eye. \\"Oh well,\\" he murmured, finally feeling the gentle tug of sleep, \\"real or not, it would've been the best New Year's Eve ever.\\" And with that thought, Nick Wilde closed his eyes, this time drifting off to dream of adventures yet to come with Judy and the rest of his Zootopian friends, alien or otherwise."},{"prompt":"Pop (UK), Current shows list (as of May 2024) Pokemon (2018-present) GoGoRiki (2010-2012, 2024-present) The Hollow (2024-present) Horrid Henry (2024-present) Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids (2023-present) Battle for Dream Island (2024-present) YooHoo and Friends (2012, 2024-present) In Febuary 2024, the channel underwent a major overhaul, removing all its current shows (Alvin & the Chipmunks, Squish, Total Dramarama, etc.) and brought back GoGoRiki and YooHoo and Friends, The Hollow and Horrid Henry were new shows, Battle for Dream Island would premiere in April.

As the evening sky darkened on the last night of January 2024, a sense of anticipation filled the air for fans of Pop TV across the United Kingdom. The clock was winding down to an event poised to redefine the beloved channel – a major programming overhaul promising an invigorating blend of brand-new shows and heartwarming returns. It was a night marked for change, and as families and animation enthusiasts settled in front of their televisions, they knew they were about to witness a pivotal moment in Pop TV history. The farewell marathon began under the blanket of night, with each outgoing show granted one final hoorah before making way for the future. This nostalgic journey kicked off with the harmonic endeavors of \\"Alvin & the Chipmunks\\" and concluded with the playful jiggles of \\"Squish.\\" As the credits rolled for the last time on these series, viewers couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness, bundled with the thrill of what was to come. But in the midst of these farewells, something whimsical was happening. Each show's conclusion was followed by a \\"GoGoRiki\\" bumper, lending a sense of continuity and teasing the imminent arrival of the channel's refreshed face. Like a comet streaking through the night signaling the start of a new cycle, \\"GoGoRiki\\" served as the harbinger of Pop TV's rebirth. As the hours ticked by and the marathon drew to a close, the excitement reached a crescendo. And then, at the stroke of 6:00 AM, in the quiet stillness of dawn, the transformation commenced. With the break of the new day, \\"GoGoRiki\\" signaled, quite literally, the starting bell of the revamped Pop TV, leading viewers into a diverse realm of animation that spans genres, styles, and age groups. \\"Pokémon,\\" a time-honored classic that continues to spark joy and adventure with every episode, now stood at the forefront of the channel's lineup, emblematic of Pop TV's enduring charm and appeal. The newer entries, such as the intriguing and enigmatic world of \\"The Hollow\\" and the laugh-inducing calamities of \\"Horrid Henry,\\" are set to carve out their own legacies and capture fresh hearts and minds. Nostalgic returns like \\"YooHoo and Friends,\\" coupled with \\"Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids,\\" which provided a taste of the changes back in November, bring varied flavors to the table – a hint of sentimental joy and a dash of spine-tingling chills, respectively. And as \\"Battle for Dream Island\\" prepares to make its grand entrance in April, there's a palpable sense of anticipation for this unorthodox and engaging approach to animated storytelling. In those early dawn hours, as the first rays of sunlight peeked through the curtains, Pop TV opened its arms to welcome a new day, a new direction, and a new vision for kids' programming. Gone were the yesterdays of familiar sequences and well-trod narrative paths. Ahead lays a future filled with excitement, discovery, and innovative animated tales ready to fill imaginations and reignite a passion for animated storytelling. So, as the night of change comes to an end and we rise to embrace the possibilities presented by Pop TV's bold evolution, let's applaud the memory of the shows we've cherished and make room in our hearts for the new friends and adventures that await. Stay tuned, dear viewers, for the adventure has just begun! #PopTV #NewBeginnings #AnimationRising #GoodbyeOldFriends #HelloNewWorld #UKKidsEntertainment"},{"prompt":"L'akatsuki a capturé combien de démon ?","completion":"L'Akatsuki, l'organisation de shinobi renégats dans l'univers de \\"Naruto\\", avait pour objectif de capturer tous les neuf Bijuus (démons à queues) afin de réaliser leur plan de domination du monde. Les Bijuus vont de Shukaku (Ichibi) le démon à une queue, jusqu'à Kurama (Kyuubi) le démon renard à neuf queues. Toutefois, à la fin de leur entreprise, l'Akatsuki n'a pas réussi à capturer tous les démons. Lorsque la série \\"Naruto Shippuden\\" commence, l'organisation avait déjà capturé plusieurs Bijuus, mais au fil de l'histoire, elle parvient à capturer quelques autres. Voici les Bijuus connus pour avoir été capturés par l'Akatsuki avant et pendant les événements de la série : 1. Shukaku (Ichibi), le démon à une queue, capturé de Gaara. 2. Matatabi (Nibi), le démon chat à deux queues, capturé de Yugito Nii. 3. Isobu (Sanbi), le démon tortue à trois queues, capturé dans sa forme sauvage car il n'avait pas de jinchuriki à l'époque de sa capture. 4. Son Goku (Yonbi), le démon singe à quatre queues, capturé de Rōshi. 5. Kokuō (Gobi), le démon cheval-dolphin à cinq queues, capturé de Han. 6. Saiken (Rokubi), le démon limace à six queues, capturé de Utakata. 7. Chōmei (Nanabi), le démon à sept queues, capturé de Fū. Les exceptions sont Gyūki (Hachibi), le démon à huit queues dont le jinchuriki Killer B a réussi à duper l'Akatsuki en leur faisant croire qu'ils l'avaient capturé, et Kurama (Kyuubi), le démon renard à neuf queues, qui n'a jamais été capturé complètement par l'Akatsuki car son jinchuriki, Naruto Uzumaki, a toujours réussi à leur échapper avec l'aide de ses alliés. En résumé, l'Akatsuki a capturé sept des neuf Bijuus avant d'être finalement vaincue."},{"prompt":"Comment killer B a fait? Je croyais que naruto allait mourir après l'extraction de kyubi? Si ils n'ont pas tous les bijus , comment peut-ils ramener jubi?","completion":"Killer B a réussi à tromper l'Akatsuki lors de sa capture en leur laissant une partie de la queue du Hachibi (Gyūki), le démon à huit queues, tout en s'échappant discrètement avec l'essentiel de Gyūki encore scellé en lui. Grâce à son talent de rappeur et sa maîtrise du Raiton, combinés avec les capacités de son Biju, B a su créer un clone en queue de pieuvre qui a été pris pour son véritable corps. Ainsi, l'Akatsuki a cru l'avoir capturé et drainé complètement de son Biju alors que ce n'était pas le cas. Concernant l'extraction des Bijuus, il est effectivement dangereux pour un Jinchuriki de se faire extraire le monstre à queue scellé en lui ; cela conduit généralement à la mort. Naruto a été confronté à cette situation lorsqu'il s'est fait extraire Kurama (Kyuubi) pendant la Quatrième Grande Guerre Ninja, mais il a pu survivre grâce à différentes interventions, notamment celle de sa mère Kushina (qui avait une partie du chakra de Kurama en elle), de Minato (son père qui avait scellé l'autre moitié de Kurama en lui), et du pouvoir de guérison de Sakura. Pour ce qui est de la résurrection du Jubi (Dix-Queues), l'Akatsuki, sous la direction d'Obito Uchiha, a utilisé un morceau du chakra de Hachibi et de Kyuubi qu'ils avaient précédemment réussi à obtenir pour commencer le processus de résurrection. Ils ont estimé qu'ils avaient suffisamment de la \\"substance\\" des neuf Bijuus pour recommencer le projet de Mugen Tsukuyomi et ramener à la vie le Jubi, bien que ce processus ait été précaire et imparfait sans les parties entières de ces deux Bijuus. Cela a donné lieu à une version incomplète du Jubi, qui a néanmoins possédé une puissance immense et a pu être améliorée au fil du temps, en particulier après que Madara Uchiha ait rejoint le combat et pris le contrôle de la situation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture. Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistry TRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Lewis acid-base concepts are important ideas for organic chemistry. However, as the emphasis in AP Chemistry is on reactions in aqueous solution, these concepts will not be examined. TRA-2.C.1 Balanced chemical equations for redox reactions can be constructed from half-reactions. TRA-3.A.1 The kinetics of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate at which an amount of reactants is converted to products per unit of time. TRA-3.A.2 The rates of change of reactant and product concentrations are determined by the stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation. TRA-3.A.3 The rate of a reaction is influenced by reactant concentrations, temperature, surface area, catalysts, and other environmental factors. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant. TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k. TRA-3.C.6 Radioactive decay processes provide an important illustration of first order kinetics. TRA-4.A.1 The rate law of an elementary reaction can be inferred from the stoichiometry of the molecules participating in a collision. TRA-4.A.2 Elementary reactions involving the simultaneous collision of three or more particles are rare. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature. TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state. X CALCULATIONS INVOLVING THE ARRHENIUS EQUATION WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction. TRA-5.A.3 A reaction intermediate is produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others, such that it is present only while a reaction is occurring. TRA-5.A.4 Experimental detection of a reaction intermediate is a common way to build evidence in support of one reaction mechanism over an alternative mechanism. X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.B.1 For reaction mechanisms in which each elementary step is irreversible, or in which the first step is rate limiting, the rate law of the reaction is set by the molecularity of the slowest elementary step (i.e., the rate-limiting step). X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.C.1 If the first elementary reaction is not rate limiting, approximations (such as steady state) must be made to determine a rate law expression. TRA-5.D.1 Knowledge of the energetics of each elementary reaction in a mechanism allows for the construction of an energy profile for a multistep reaction. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process. ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON systems where a dissolved species in equilibrium with that species in the gas phase will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X Computation of the concetration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When G<0 for the process, it is said to thermodynamically favored. The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of H and S. In cases where H<0 and S>0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Negative will not be assessed on the ap exam. Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Standard gibbs free energy change is proportional to the negative of the cell proportional to the negative of the cell potential for the redox reaction from which it is constructed. Thus a cell with a positive Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. ENE-6.D.1 Faraday’s laws can be used to determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell with respect to the following: a. Number of electrons transferred b.

In the extensive list of knowledge statements provided earlier, there wasn't a specific mention of complexation reactions and chelation. These topics are typically relevant to discussions involving coordination chemistry, which is a subset of inorganic chemistry that explores the structure and properties of complex metal ions with ligands. Considering the AP Chemistry curriculum, topics such as complexation reactions and chelation might not be as deeply covered or emphasized unless they are specifically related to understanding solubility through complex ion equilibria or other relevant concepts. For the AP Chemistry exam and the specific knowledge statements you've provided, a focus on solubility equilibria, especially with regards to the solubility product constant (Ksp) and the common-ion effect, is pertinent. Complexation reactions might only be relevant if they're tied to topics like solubility, but they wouldn't be a main focus.

Aqui está o porquê dessas ações serem potencialmente vantajosas: # Desabilitando processos em segundo plano Por padrão, o Android permite que aplicativos executem processos em segundo plano para realizar tarefas mesmo quando não estão em uso ativo. Esses processos podem incluir sincronização de dados, atualizações de conteúdo e outras atividades de manutenção. No entanto, esses processos podem consumir recursos do sistema, como CPU e memória RAM, além de drenar a bateria, causando os seguintes efeitos: 1. **Melhoria de desempenho:** Desativando ou limitando processos em segundo plano, você reduz a carga sobre os recursos do sistema. Isso pode resultar em uma experiência de usuário mais rápida e responsiva, principalmente em dispositivos com hardware limitado. 2. **Aumento da vida útil da bateria:** Menos processos em funcionamento significam menos uso de energia, o que pode prolongar a duração da bateria do seu dispositivo. 3. **Menor aquecimento:** Processos em segundo plano podem levar a um aumento na temperatura do dispositivo. Reduzi-los pode ajudar a manter seu telefone mais frio. # Desabilitando a escala de animação da janela e outras animações O Android utiliza animações para transições entre telas, abertura e fechamento de aplicativos, e outras interações da interface do usuário. Estas animações proporcionam uma experiência visual mais suave e agradável para o usuário, mas também requerem processamento adicional que pode impactar o desempenho do telefone. Ajustando ou desabilitando animações, você pode observar os seguintes benefícios: 1. **Interface mais ágil:** Com animações reduzidas ou desativadas, a interface do usuário pode parecer mais rápida porque a transição entre atividades e tarefas ocorre quase instantaneamente sem os atrasos adicionais das animações. 2. **Menor uso de CPU e GPU:** Executar animações exige de ambos, a CPU e a GPU do dispositivo. Desabilitá-las pode liberar esses recursos para outros processos mais críticos. 3. **Economia de bateria:** Como com a desativação de processos em segundo plano, reduzir as animações pode resultar em economia de energia e aumentar a longevidade da bateria, já que a GPU consome menos energia. # Como desabilitá-los: Para desabilitar processos em segundo plano ou ajustar as opções de animação no Android, você precisa ativar as Opções de desenvolvedor seguindo estas etapas: 1. Vá até as Configurações do dispositivo (Settings). 2. Desça até Sobre o telefone (About phone). 3. Toque várias vezes no número da versão do build até que seja informado que as Opções de desenvolvedor estão ativadas. 4. Retorne ao menu de Configurações e você encontrará as Opções de desenvolvedor. 5. Dentro das Opções de desenvolvedor, você pode limitar os processos em segundo plano e ajustar as escalas de animação. Lembre-se que fazer esses ajustes pode ter consequências indesejadas, como aplicativos que não atualizam em segundo plano ou uma experiência de usuário que pode parecer menos fluida. Portanto, ao ajustar essas configurações, faça-o com cautela e esteja ciente de como essas mudanças podem afetar o uso diário do seu dispositivo Android."},{"prompt":"O Que é responsivo","completion":"\\"Responsivo\\" é um termo que, no contexto da tecnologia e design web, refere-se à capacidade de um site ou aplicação de se adaptar automaticamente ao tamanho da tela do dispositivo que o está acessando. Isso significa que um site responsivo deve parecer bom e ser funcional tanto em uma tela de desktop grande quanto em uma tela de smartphone pequena ou em qualquer dispositivo intermediário, como tablets. Para alcançar a responsividade, designers e desenvolvedores web utilizam uma combinação de layouts flexíveis, imagens e uma estratégia de design chamada \\"mobile-first\\", na qual o site é projetado para telas móveis primeiro e então adaptado para telas maiores. Eles também implementam media queries no CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), que permitem que o site mude sua aparência com base nas características do dispositivo, como a largura da tela ou a resolução. Essa prática tornou-se uma parte essencial da criação de sites devido ao aumento do uso de dispositivos móveis para acessar a internet.

We see a Khalasar of horse-mounted warriors, led by a fierce and renowned Khal named Drago. They ride like the wind, their horses' hooves thundering on the ground. A large convoy of various Westerosi and Essos nobles, recognizable by their banners, ride on finely bred horses. They are led by an exiled knight, Ser Rodrik \\"the Rapid,\\" famous for being the quickest rider in the Seven Kingdoms. Khal Drago: (Shouting in Dothraki) \\"Today we ride with the fury of the great stallion! None can match the speed of our hooves!\\" Ser Rodrik \\"the Rapid,\\" smirking: \\"You have not yet seen Westerosi steel fly on four legs, Khal. I'm ready to put your dothraki pride to the test.\\" The group rides to an open field fashioned into a makeshift race course, marked by banners and small fires. Riders from all over Essos and Westeros have joined to test their skill and the speed of their horses. Arya Stark, in disguise, a known lover of adventure and skilled rider, is among the competitors, riding a swift, sturdy northern breed. She nods at Ser Rodrik, recognizing him despite her guise. Arya Stark, under her breath: \\"It's not the sword that wins the battle, nor the rider that wins the race. It's the bond between horse and heart.\\" Tyrion Lannister sits outside the racecourse, a cup of wine in hand, smirking at the spectacle. Across from him, Daenerys Targaryen watches with keen interest, her dragon perched not too far above, casting a large shadow over the field. Tyrion Lannister: \\"I would wager a cask of the finest Dornish red that none can best Arya Stark in this race.\\" Daenerys Targaryen, with a slight grin: \\"Careful, Imp. The Dothraki live in the saddle. Drago is like to ride as if the very wind has taken flesh.\\" The race begins with an explosive start. The sound of dozens of horses launching forward is deafening. Ser Rodrik and Khal Drago take the lead, with Arya close behind. Ser Rodrik: (Shouting over the rush of wind) \\"You may rule the plains, Khal, but today I will teach you the meaning of haste!\\" Khal Drago, grinning wildly: (Responds in Dothraki) \\"We shall see if your foreign steed can dance with the swift sons of the Great Grass Sea!\\" As they race through the course, navigating obstacles, The Hound, not to be left behind, barrels through on his massive warhorse, Stranger. With each thunderous stride, he closes the gap, his face a mask of intense focus. The Hound: (Rumbles with laughter) \\"Hope you lot don't mind the dust! Stranger eats your fancy horses for breakfast!\\" Coming into the final stretch, Arya makes her move, urging her horse forward with a fierce cry. The horse responds, its northern stamina becoming apparent as it powers ahead. Arya Stark, yelling: \\"Winter is coming—and so am I!\\" With a burst of speed, Arya and her horse surge to the front. Ser Rodrik and Khal Drago push their mounts to the limit, but it's too late. Arya Stark crosses the finish line, proving once again her prowess in all things. Khal Drago, reining in his panting horse, nods with respect at Arya: \\"You ride well, Westerosi. You have the spirit of a Dothraki screamer.\\" Ser Rodrik, dismounting, approaches Arya, grinning broadly: \\"Seems this old knight still has much to learn. Well ridden, young wolf.\\" Arya Stark, removing her hood, revealing herself: \\"A Stark always remembers.\\" The crowd, a mix of Dothraki screamers and Westerosi lords and ladies, roars with excitement and disbelief. Daenerys approaches Arya, an approving look in her eyes. Daenerys Targaryen: \\"I could use someone with your skills. Perhaps you'd be willing to race against the wind itself, on the back of a dragon?\\" Arya Stark, with a defiant smirk: \\"Tell me, Your Grace, do dragons know the taste of defeat?\\" The crowd laughs and cheers as stories of the race – of the hooves and honor – will be told across both the plains of the Dothraki Sea and the cobbled streets of King's Landing.

SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture. Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistry TRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Lewis acid-base concepts are important ideas for organic chemistry. However, as the emphasis in AP Chemistry is on reactions in aqueous solution, these concepts will not be examined. TRA-2.C.1 Balanced chemical equations for redox reactions can be constructed from half-reactions. TRA-3.A.1 The kinetics of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate at which an amount of reactants is converted to products per unit of time. TRA-3.A.2 The rates of change of reactant and product concentrations are determined by the stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation. TRA-3.A.3 The rate of a reaction is influenced by reactant concentrations, temperature, surface area, catalysts, and other environmental factors. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant. TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k. TRA-3.C.6 Radioactive decay processes provide an important illustration of first order kinetics. TRA-4.A.1 The rate law of an elementary reaction can be inferred from the stoichiometry of the molecules participating in a collision. TRA-4.A.2 Elementary reactions involving the simultaneous collision of three or more particles are rare. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature. TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state. X CALCULATIONS INVOLVING THE ARRHENIUS EQUATION WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction. TRA-5.A.3 A reaction intermediate is produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others, such that it is present only while a reaction is occurring. TRA-5.A.4 Experimental detection of a reaction intermediate is a common way to build evidence in support of one reaction mechanism over an alternative mechanism. X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.B.1 For reaction mechanisms in which each elementary step is irreversible, or in which the first step is rate limiting, the rate law of the reaction is set by the molecularity of the slowest elementary step (i.e., the rate-limiting step). X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.C.1 If the first elementary reaction is not rate limiting, approximations (such as steady state) must be made to determine a rate law expression. TRA-5.D.1 Knowledge of the energetics of each elementary reaction in a mechanism allows for the construction of an energy profile for a multistep reaction. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process. ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON systems where a dissolved species in equilibrium with that species in the gas phase will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X Computation of the concetration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When G<0 for the process, it is said to thermodynamically favored. The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of H and S. In cases where H<0 and S>0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Negative will not be assessed on the ap exam. Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Standard gibbs free energy change is proportional to the negative of the cell proportional to the negative of the cell potential for the redox reaction from which it is constructed. Thus a cell with a positive Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. ENE-6.D.1 Faraday’s laws can be used to determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell with respect to the following: a. Number of electrons transferred b. Mass of material deposited on or removed from an electrode c. Current d. Time elapsed e.

Two of these items are Bowser's Curse and Bowser's Reverse Curse. Here's what they do: **Bowser's Curse:** When inflicted with Bowser's Curse, all players are cursed for a number of turns specified by Bowser (usually 1 turn). While under the effect of the curse, players can only roll a dice block that goes up to a maximum of 3, rather than the standard 10. This significantly reduces the distance they can move on the board on their next turn. **Bowser's Reverse Curse:** This curse causes all players to move in the opposite direction (backwards) on the board for a specified number of turns. This can be particularly annoying as it can send players away from their intended destination, such as a Star space, and can force them into encounters with spaces they would rather avoid. Both of these curses can affect the strategies and planning of the players, adding an element of chaos and unpredictability to the game, which is a hallmark of the Mario Party series.

Ele é conhecido por ser um dos feiticeiros mais poderosos da série, e sua técnica de Expansão de Domínio é chamada de \\"Território Ilimitado\\" (em japonês: 無量空処, \\"Muryō Kūsho\\"). A Expansão de Domínio é uma técnica avançada dentro do universo de Jujutsu Kaisen que permite ao usuário criar uma área onde sua técnica amaldiçoada é imensamente potencializada. Basicamente, é uma realidade construída sob as regras do usuário, dificultando muito para o oponente se defender ou neutralizar os ataques. A técnica \\"Território Ilimitado\\" de Gojo é baseada no princípio de sua técnica amaldiçoada chamada \\"Limitless\\" (休止呪法「無限」, \\"Kyūshi Jujutsu 'Mugen'\\"), que manipula o espaço ao infinitamente ajustar o espaço entre as coisas. Quando ele ativa o Território Ilimitado, ele cria uma área onde ele controla absolutamente o espaço, ao ponto de os conceitos de distância e direção se tornarem irrelevantes. Dentro do Território Ilimitado, Gojo pode manipular o espaço à vontade, fazendo com que seus ataques alcançem o adversário de qualquer ângulo e que seja quase impossível para o inimigo se aproximar ou tocar nele. Isso se deve ao fato de a técnica \\"Limitless\\" basear-se na Teoria do Infinito, que coloca qualquer atacante ou ataque numa sequência de aproximação que nunca realmente atinge o alvo (pense em tentar chegar a um ponto movendo-se metade da distância restante a cada tentativa - você continua se aproximando, mas nunca chega lá). Além disso, o poder do \\"Território Ilimitado\\" é tal que pode sobrecarregar os sentidos de quem é apanhado dentro dele, causando um afluxo de informações que o cérebro não é capaz de processar, levando-os a ficarem imobilizados.

Ele é um personagem com um papel significativo na história, especialmente no que diz respeito ao passado e à herança dos Titãs. Embora sua aparição seja relativamente breve, Kruger deixa várias lições importantes que podem ser extraídas de suas ações e palavras: 1. **O peso dos sacrifícios**: Kruger teve que fazer escolhas difíceis e sacrificar muitos, inclusive compatriotas, para manter sua identidade secreta como espião. Sua história ensina sobre o peso dos sacrifícios necessários em prol de um objetivo maior e a complexidade moral que envolve tais decisões. 2. **A importância da memória e da história**: Kruger enfatiza a importância de lembrar do passado e aprender com ele. Ele encarrega Grisha Yeager, a quem passa o poder do Titã de Ataque, de cumprir essa missão, destacando que esquecer a história pode levar à repetição dos mesmos erros. 3. **Lutar pela liberdade**: Um dos temas centrais de \\"Attack on Titan\\" é a luta pela liberdade. Kruger luta contra a opressão de Marley e busca a liberdade para o povo de Eldia, mostrando que às vezes é necessário enfrentar grandes adversidades para alcançar a liberdade. 4. **O poder de uma promessa**: Kruger faz Grisha prometer que ele cumprirá a missão de retomar a Ilha Paradis e recuperar o poder dos Titãs para Eldia. A promessa é um fio condutor que move a narrativa e mostra como uma promessa pode motivar ações e mudanças significativas. 5. **A complexidade do bem e do mal**: A personagem de Kruger é um exemplo da ambiguidade moral presente em \\"Attack on Titan\\". Ele não é claramente bom ou mau; suas ações são guiadas por uma noção de justiça que o leva a cometer atos questionáveis. Isso nos ensina que a realidade é complexa e que as noções de bem e mal podem ser relativas e dependentes de perspectiva. 6. **A transmissão de vontades**: Kruger revela que os Titãs herdam não apenas os poderes, mas também as memórias e vontades de seus antecessores. Isso simboliza como as gerações passadas influenciam as atuais e como as ações de uma pessoa podem ressoar e afetar o futuro. 7. **O custo da guerra e do ódio**: Através de sua história, Kruger mostra o custo humano da guerra e do ciclo de ódio que pode perpetuar o sofrimento através das gerações. Ele destaca a necessidade de quebrar esse ciclo para alcançar uma paz verdadeira. As lições de Eren Kruger são entrelaçadas com os temas mais amplos de \\"Attack on Titan\\", oferecendo reflexões sobre a natureza humana, o poder da determinação e as consequências de nossas escolhas."},{"prompt":"O Que É O Flashtime e como ele funciona","completion":"O \\"Flashtime\\" é um conceito introduzido na série de televisão \\"The Flash\\", que faz parte do Arrowverse, um conjunto de séries de televisão baseadas nos personagens da DC Comics. O Flashtime não é um termo originário dos quadrinhos, mas foi criado especificamente para a série. No contexto da série, o Flashtime é uma habilidade que Barry Allen, o Flash, utiliza para entrar em um estado onde ele se move tão rapidamente que tudo ao seu redor parece estar congelado no tempo. Quando Barry está no Flashtime, ele pode interagir com outras pessoas, trazendo-as para esse estado de super-velocidade, permitindo que elas percebam e reajam ao mundo como se estivessem se movendo a uma velocidade normal, enquanto, para todos os outros, eles estão se movendo incrivelmente rápido. Como funciona o Flashtime na série \\"The Flash\\": 1. **Percepção Acelerada**: Barry Allen, como o Flash, possui uma percepção acelerada que lhe permite ver e reagir a eventos em uma fração de segundo. O Flashtime é a extensão máxima dessa habilidade, onde ele se move e pensa tão rapidamente que o tempo normal parece estar parado. 2. **Movimento Super-Rápido**: A habilidade de entrar no Flashtime está diretamente relacionada à conexão de Barry com a Força de Aceleração, uma dimensão de energia que lhe dá seus poderes de super-velocidade. Ao acessar essa energia, ele pode se mover a velocidades que ultrapassam a percepção humana. 3. **Efeitos Físicos**: Enquanto no Flashtime, Barry pode experimentar um grande desgaste físico, pois manter essa velocidade extrema exige muito de seu corpo. Se ele permanecer nesse estado por muito tempo, pode até mesmo correr o risco de exaustão ou pior. 4. **Interação com Outros**: Uma característica única do Flashtime é a capacidade de Barry de tocar em outra pessoa e trazê-la para o estado de Flashtime com ele. Isso permite que ele converse e interaja com outros personagens em \\"tempo real\\" enquanto o mundo ao redor deles permanece em um estado de quase paralisia. O Flashtime é um exemplo de como a série \\"The Flash\\" explora as possibilidades criativas da super-velocidade e a física associada a um super-herói que pode se mover mais rápido do que a luz. Embora seja uma ficção científica e não tenha base na realidade, o conceito é usado para criar momentos dramáticos e resolver problemas de maneiras únicas dentro do universo da série."},{"prompt":"Write an unofficial and noncanonical timeline of the life of Nick Wilde from Zootopia, assuming that the movie takes place in 2016, Nick is 32 years old when the movie takes place, and Nick was born in 1984.

SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture. Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistry TRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Lewis acid-base concepts are important ideas for organic chemistry. However, as the emphasis in AP Chemistry is on reactions in aqueous solution, these concepts will not be examined. TRA-2.C.1 Balanced chemical equations for redox reactions can be constructed from half-reactions. TRA-3.A.1 The kinetics of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate at which an amount of reactants is converted to products per unit of time. TRA-3.A.2 The rates of change of reactant and product concentrations are determined by the stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation. TRA-3.A.3 The rate of a reaction is influenced by reactant concentrations, temperature, surface area, catalysts, and other environmental factors. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant. TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k. TRA-3.C.6 Radioactive decay processes provide an important illustration of first order kinetics. TRA-4.A.1 The rate law of an elementary reaction can be inferred from the stoichiometry of the molecules participating in a collision. TRA-4.A.2 Elementary reactions involving the simultaneous collision of three or more particles are rare. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature. TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state. X CALCULATIONS INVOLVING THE ARRHENIUS EQUATION WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction. TRA-5.A.3 A reaction intermediate is produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others, such that it is present only while a reaction is occurring. TRA-5.A.4 Experimental detection of a reaction intermediate is a common way to build evidence in support of one reaction mechanism over an alternative mechanism. X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.B.1 For reaction mechanisms in which each elementary step is irreversible, or in which the first step is rate limiting, the rate law of the reaction is set by the molecularity of the slowest elementary step (i.e., the rate-limiting step). X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.C.1 If the first elementary reaction is not rate limiting, approximations (such as steady state) must be made to determine a rate law expression. TRA-5.D.1 Knowledge of the energetics of each elementary reaction in a mechanism allows for the construction of an energy profile for a multistep reaction. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process. ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON systems where a dissolved species in equilibrium with that species in the gas phase will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X Computation of the concetration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When G<0 for the process, it is said to thermodynamically favored. The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of H and S. In cases where H<0 and S>0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Negative will not be assessed on the ap exam. Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Standard gibbs free energy change is proportional to the negative of the cell proportional to the negative of the cell potential for the redox reaction from which it is constructed. Thus a cell with a positive Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. ENE-6.D.1 Faraday’s laws can be used to determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell with respect to the following: a. Number of electrons transferred b.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"Go through statement below and list specific topics that cover the content in the essential knowledge statement. SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains. EQN: n = m/M SPQ-1.B.1 The mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature. SPQ-1.B.2 The average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance. X INTERPRETING MASS SPECTRA Interpreting mass spectra of samples containing multiple elements or peaks arising from species other than singly charged monatomic ions will not be assessed on the AP Exam. SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons. SAP-3.A.1 Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law. SAP-3.A.2 Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. SAP-3.A.3 Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond. a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond. b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles. c. All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum. SAP-3.A.4 The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding. SAP-3.A.5 In a metallic solid, the valence electrons from the metal atoms are considered to be delocalized and not associated with any individual atom. SAP-3.B.1 A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms. Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms). SAP-3.B.2 In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple). Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies. SAP-3.B.3 Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions. a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions. b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions. SAP-3.C.1 The cations and anions in an ionic crystal are arranged in a systematic, periodic 3-D array that maximizes the attractive forces among cations and anions while minimizing the repulsive forces. X KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Study of specific crystal structures is not essential to an understanding of the big ideas. SAP-3.D.1 Metallic bonding can be represented as an array of positive metal ions surrounded by delocalized valence electrons (i.e., a “sea of electrons”). SAP-3.D.2 Interstitial alloys form between atoms of different radii, where the smaller atoms fill the interstitial spaces between the larger atoms (e.g., with steel in which carbon occupies the interstices in iron). SAP-3.D.3 Substitutional alloys form between atoms of comparable radius, where one atom substitutes for the other in the lattice. (In certain brass alloys, other elements, usually zinc, substitute for copper.) Lewis diagrams can be constructed according to an established set of principles. SAP-4.B.1 In cases where more than one equivalent Lewis structure can be constructed, resonance must be included as a refinement to the Lewis structure. In many such cases, this refinement is needed to provide qualitatively accurate predictions of molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.2 The octet rule and formal charge can be used as criteria for determining which of several possible valid Lewis diagrams provides the best model for predicting molecular structure and properties. SAP-4.B.3 As with any model, there are limitations to the use of the Lewis structure model, particularly in cases with an odd number of valence electrons SAP-4.C.1 VSEPR theory uses the Coulombic repulsion between electrons as a basis for predicting the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. SAP-4.C.2 Both Lewis diagrams and VSEPR theory must be used for predicting electronic and structural properties of many covalently bonded molecules and polyatomic ions, including the following: a. Molecular geometry b. Bond angles c. Relative bond energies based on bond order d. Relative bond lengths (multiple bonds, effects of atomic radius) e. Presence of a dipole moment f. Hybridization of valence orbitals of the molecule SAP-4.C.3 The terms “hybridization” and “hybrid atomic orbital” are used to describe the arrangement of electrons around a central atom. When the central atom is sp hybridized, its ideal bond angles are 180°; for sp2 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 120°; and for sp3 hybridized atoms the bond angles are 109.5°. X AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2 , and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure. X HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE RESULTING MOLECULE. Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2 , and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam. SAP-4.C.4 Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers. SAP-5.A.1 London dispersion forces are a result of the Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules. a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules. b. The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud. It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding. c. The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.” SAP-5.A.2 The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species. a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule. b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation. Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces. c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules. These tend to be stronger than dipoledipole forces. SAP-5.A.3 The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole. SAP-5.A.4 Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O, and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule. SAP-5.A.5 In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. SAP-5.B.1 Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle. SAP-5.B.2 Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties. SAP-5.B.3 Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points. They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent. SAP-5.B.4 In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a threedimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily. SAP-5.B.5 Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers. SAP-5.B.6 Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting. SAP-5.B.7 In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions. SAP-6.A.1 Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together. SAP-6.A.2 The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles. SAP-6.A.3 The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times. SAP-6.A.4 In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape. X UNDERSTANDING/INTERPRETING PHASE DIAGRAMS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Phase diagrams of pure substances are considered prior knowledge. SAP-7.A.1 The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law: EQN: PV = nRT. SAP-7.A.2 In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures. EQN: PA = Ptotal × XA, where XA = moles A/total moles; EQN: Ptotal = PA + PB + PC + … SAP-7.A.3 Graphical representations of the relationships between P, V, T, and n are useful to describe gas behavior. SAP-7.B.1 The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) relates the macroscopic properties of gases to motions of the particles in the gas. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of the kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.B.2 All the particles in a sample of matter are in continuous, random motion. The average kinetic energy of a particle is related to its average velocity by the equation: EQN: KE = ½ mv2 . SAP-7.B.3 The Kelvin temperature of a sample of matter is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. SAP-7.B.4 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution provides a graphical representation of the energies/ velocities of particles at a given temperature. SAP-7.C.1 The ideal gas law does not explain the actual behavior of real gases. Deviations from the ideal gas law may result from interparticle attractions among gas molecules, particularly at conditions that are close to those resulting in condensation. Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures. SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture. Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible or soluble in one another. SAP-8.A.1 Differences in absorption or emission of photons in different spectral regions are related to the different types of molecular motion or electronic transition: a. Microwave radiation is associated with transitions in molecular rotational levels. b. Infrared radiation is associated with transitions in molecular vibrational levels. c. Ultraviolet/visible radiation is associated with transitions in electronic energy levels. SAP-8.B.1 When a photon is absorbed (or emitted) by an atom or molecule, the energy of the species is increased (or decreased) by an amount equal to the energy of the photon. SAP-8.B.2 The wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is related to its frequency and the speed of light by the equation: EQN: c = λν. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave through Planck’s equation (E = ℎν). SAP-8.C.1 The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light by a solution to three variables according to the equation: EQN: A = Ebc. The molar absorptivity E describes how intensely a sample of molecules or ions absorbs light of a specific wavelength. The path length b and concentration c are proportional to the number of absorbing species. SAP-8.C.2 In most experiments the path length and wavelength of light are held constant. In such cases, the absorbance is proportional only to the concentration of absorbing molecules or ions. TRA-1.A.1 A physical change occurs when a substance undergoes a change in properties but not a change in composition. Changes in the phase of a substance (solid, liquid, gas) or formation/ separation of mixtures of substances are common physical changes. TRA-1.A.2 A chemical change occurs when substances are transformed into new substances, typically with different compositions. Production of heat or light, formation of a gas, formation of a precipitate, and/or color change provide possible evidence that a chemical change has occurred. TRA-1.B.1 All physical and chemical processes can be represented symbolically by balanced equations. TRA-1.B.2 Chemical equations represent chemical changes. These changes are the result of a rearrangement of atoms into new combinations; thus, any representation of a chemical change must contain equal numbers of atoms of every element before and after the change occurred. Equations thus demonstrate that mass is conserved in chemical reactions. TRA-1.B.3 Balanced molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations are differing symbolic forms used to represent a chemical reaction. The form used to represent the reaction depends on the context in which it is to be used. TRA-1.C.1 Balanced chemical equations in their various forms can be translated into symbolic particulate representations. TRA-1.D.1 Processes that involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds are typically classified as chemical processes. Processes that involve only changes in intermolecular interactions, such as phase changes, are typically classified as physical processes. TRA-1.D.2 Sometimes physical processes involve the breaking of chemical bonds. For example, plausible arguments could be made for the dissolution of a salt in water, as either a physical or chemical process, involves breaking of ionic bonds, and the formation of ion-dipole interactions between ions and solvent. SPQ-4.A.1 Because atoms must be conserved during a chemical process, it is possible to calculate product amounts by using known reactant amounts, or to calculate reactant amounts given known product amounts. SPQ-4.A.2 Coefficients of balanced chemical equations contain information regarding the proportionality of the amounts of substances involved in the reaction. These values can be used in chemical calculations involving the mole concept. SPQ-4.A.3 Stoichiometric calculations can be combined with the ideal gas law and calculations involving molarity to quantitatively study gases and solutions. SPQ-4.B.1 Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached. This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration. TRA-2.A.1 Acid-base reactions involve transfer of one or more protons between chemical species. TRA-2.A.2 Oxidation-reduction reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons between chemical species, as indicated by changes in oxidation numbers of the involved species. Combustion is an important subclass of oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a species reacts with oxygen gas. In the case of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and water are products of complete combustion. TRA-2.A.3 In a redox reaction, electrons are transferred from the species that is oxidized to the species that is reduced. X THE MEANING OF THE TERMS “REDUCING AGENT” AND “OXIDIZING AGENT” WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Understanding this terminology is not necessary for reasoning about redox chemistry TRA-2.A.4 Oxidation numbers may be assigned to each of the atoms in the reactants and products; this is often an effective way to identify the oxidized and reduced species in a redox reaction. TRA-2.A.5 Precipitation reactions frequently involve mixing ions in aqueous solution to produce an insoluble or sparingly soluble ionic compound. All sodium, potassium, ammonium, and nitrate salts are soluble in water. X ROTE MEMORIZATION OF “SOLUBILITY RULES” OTHER THAN THOSE IMPLIED IN TRA-2.A.5 WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-2.B.1 By definition, a Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor. TRA-2.B.2 Only in aqueous solutions, water plays an important role in many acid-base reactions, as its molecular structure allows it to accept protons from and donate protons to dissolved species. TRA-2.B.3 When an acid or base ionizes in water, the conjugate acid-base pairs can be identified and their relative strengths compared. X LEWIS ACID-BASE CONCEPTS WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Lewis acid-base concepts are important ideas for organic chemistry. However, as the emphasis in AP Chemistry is on reactions in aqueous solution, these concepts will not be examined. TRA-2.C.1 Balanced chemical equations for redox reactions can be constructed from half-reactions. TRA-3.A.1 The kinetics of a chemical reaction is defined as the rate at which an amount of reactants is converted to products per unit of time. TRA-3.A.2 The rates of change of reactant and product concentrations are determined by the stoichiometry in the balanced chemical equation. TRA-3.A.3 The rate of a reaction is influenced by reactant concentrations, temperature, surface area, catalysts, and other environmental factors. TRA-3.B.1 Experimental methods can be used to monitor the amounts of reactants and/or products of a reaction and to determine the rate of the reaction. TRA-3.B.2 The rate law expresses the rate of a reaction as proportional to the concentration of each reactant raised to a power. TRA-3.B.3 The power of each reactant in the rate law is the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The sum of the powers of the reactant concentrations in the rate law is the overall order of the reaction. TRA-3.B.4 The proportionality constant in the rate law is called the rate constant. The value of this constant is temperature dependent and the units reflect the overall reaction order. TRA-3.B.5 Comparing initial rates of a reaction is a method to determine the order with respect to each reactant. TRA-3.C.1 The order of a reaction can be inferred from a graph of concentration of reactant versus time. TRA-3.C.2 If a reaction is first order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the natural log (ln) of the reactant concentration as a function of time will be linear. TRA-3.C.3 If a reaction is second order with respect to a reactant being monitored, a plot of the reciprocal of the concentration of that reactant versus time will be linear. TRA-3.C.4 The slopes of the concentration versus time data for zeroth, first, and second order reactions can be used to determine the rate constant for the reaction. Zeroth order: EQN: [A]t − [A]0 = −kt First order: EQN: ln[A]t − ln[A]0 = −kt Second order: EQN: 1/[A]t − 1/[A]0 = kt TRA-3.C.5 Half-life is a critical parameter for first order reactions because the half-life is constant and related to the rate constant for the reaction by the equation: EQN: t 1/2 = 0.693/k. TRA-3.C.6 Radioactive decay processes provide an important illustration of first order kinetics. TRA-4.A.1 The rate law of an elementary reaction can be inferred from the stoichiometry of the molecules participating in a collision. TRA-4.A.2 Elementary reactions involving the simultaneous collision of three or more particles are rare. TRA-4.B.1 For an elementary reaction to successfully produce products, reactants must successfully collide to initiate bond-breaking and bondmaking events. TRA-4.B.2 In most reactions, only a small fraction of the collisions leads to a reaction. Successful collisions have both sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers and orientations that allow the bonds to rearrange in the required manner. TRA-4.B.3 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve describes the distribution of particle energies; this distribution can be used to gain a qualitative estimate of the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy to lead to a reaction, and also how that fraction depends on temperature. TRA-4.C.1 Elementary reactions typically involve the breaking of some bonds and the forming of new ones. TRA-4.C.2 The reaction coordinate is the axis along which the complex set of motions involved in rearranging reactants to form products can be plotted. TRA-4.C.3 The energy profile gives the energy along the reaction coordinate, which typically proceeds from reactants, through a transition state, to products. The energy difference between the reactants and the transition state is the activation energy for the forward reaction. TRA-4.C.4 The Arrhenius equation relates the temperature dependence of the rate of an elementary reaction to the activation energy needed by molecular collisions to reach the transition state. X CALCULATIONS INVOLVING THE ARRHENIUS EQUATION WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. TRA-5.A.1 A reaction mechanism consists of a series of elementary reactions, or steps, that occur in sequence. The components may include reactants, intermediates, products, and catalysts. TRA-5.A.2 The elementary steps when combined should align with the overall balanced equation of a chemical reaction. TRA-5.A.3 A reaction intermediate is produced by some elementary steps and consumed by others, such that it is present only while a reaction is occurring. TRA-5.A.4 Experimental detection of a reaction intermediate is a common way to build evidence in support of one reaction mechanism over an alternative mechanism. X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.B.1 For reaction mechanisms in which each elementary step is irreversible, or in which the first step is rate limiting, the rate law of the reaction is set by the molecularity of the slowest elementary step (i.e., the rate-limiting step). X COLLECTION OF DATA PERTAINING TO DETECTION OF A REACTION INTERMEDIATE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Designing an experiment to identify reaction intermediates often requires knowledge that is beyond the scope of a general chemistry course. TRA-5.C.1 If the first elementary reaction is not rate limiting, approximations (such as steady state) must be made to determine a rate law expression. TRA-5.D.1 Knowledge of the energetics of each elementary reaction in a mechanism allows for the construction of an energy profile for a multistep reaction. ENE-1.A.1 In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/ or provide a reaction path with a lower activation energy relative to the original reaction coordinate. ENE-1.A.2 In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst, the net concentration of the catalyst is constant. However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism. ENE-1.A.3 Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s). Many enzymes function in this manner. ENE-1.A.4 Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate. ENE-1.A.5 In surface catalysis, a reactant or intermediate binds to, or forms a covalent bond with, the surface. This introduces elementary reactions involving these new bound reaction intermediate(s). ENE-2.A.1 Temperature changes in a system indicate energy changes. ENE-2.A.2 Energy changes in a system can be described as endothermic and exothermic processes such as the heating or cooling of a substance, phase changes, or chemical transformations. ENE-2.A.3 When a chemical reaction occurs, the energy of the system either decreases (exothermic reaction), increases (endothermic reaction), or remains the same. For exothermic reactions, the energy lost by the reacting species (system) is gained by the surroundings, as heat transfer from or work done by the system. Likewise, for endothermic reactions, the system gains energy from the surroundings by heat transfer to or work done on the system. ENE-2.A.4 The formation of a solution may be an exothermic or endothermic process, depending on the relative strengths of intermolecular/interparticle interactions before and after the dissolution process. ENE-2.B.1 A physical or chemical process can be described with an energy diagram that shows the endothermic or exothermic nature of that process. ENE-2.C.1 The particles in a warmer body have a greater average kinetic energy than those in a cooler body. ENE-2.C.2 Collisions between particles in thermal contact can result in the transfer of energy. This process is called “heat transfer,” “heat exchange,” or “transfer of energy as heat.” ENE-2.C.3 Eventually, thermal equilibrium is reached as the particles continue to collide. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of both bodies is the same, and hence, their temperatures are the same. ENE-2.D.1 The heating of a cool body by a warmer body is an important form of energy transfer between two systems. The amount of heat transferred between two bodies may be quantified by the heat transfer equation: EQN: q = mcΔT. Calorimetry experiments are used to measure the transfer of heat. ENE-2.D.2 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in chemical and physical processes. ENE-2.D.3 The transfer of a given amount of thermal energy will not produce the same temperature change in equal masses of matter with differing specific heat capacities. ENE-2.D.4 Heating a system increases the energy of the system, while cooling a system decreases the energy of the system. ENE-2.D.5 The specific heat capacity of a substance and the molar heat capacity are both used in energy calculations. ENE-2.D.6 Chemical systems change their energy through three main processes: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and chemical reactions. ENE-2.E.1 Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquidto-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses). The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gasto-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change. ENE-2.E.2 The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization. ENE-2.F.1 The enthalpy change of a reaction gives the amount of heat energy released (for negative values) or absorbed (for positive values) by a chemical reaction at constant pressure. THE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ENTHALPY AND INTERNAL ENERGY WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: These distinctions are beyond the scope of the AP Chemistry course. Most reactions studied at the AP level are carried out at constant pressure. Under these conditions the enthalpy change of the process is equal to the heat (and by extension, the energy) of reaction. For example, in the AP Chemistry course the terms “bond energy” and “bond enthalpy” are often used interchangeably. ENE-3.A.1 During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system. ENE-3.A.2 The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic. ENE-3.B.1 Tables of standard enthalpies of formation can be used to calculate the standard enthalpies of reactions. EQN: ΔH°reaction = ΣΔHf °products − ΣΔHf °reactants ENE-3.C.1 Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction. ENE-3.D.1 When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction. TRA-6.A.1 Many observable processes are reversible. Examples include evaporation and condensation of water, absorption and desorption of a gas, or dissolution and precipitation of a salt. Some important reversible chemical processes include the transfer of protons in acid-base reactions and the transfer of electrons in redox reactions. TRA-6.A.2 When equilibrium is reached, no observable changes occur in the system. Reactants and products are simultaneously present, and the concentrations or partial pressures of all species remain constant. TRA-6.A.3 The equilibrium state is dynamic. The forward and reverse processes continue to occur at equal rates, resulting in no net observable change. TRA-6.A.4 Graphs of concentration, partial pressure, or rate of reaction versus time for simple chemical reactions can be used to understand the establishment of chemical equilibrium. TRA-6.B.1 If the rate of the forward reaction is greater than the reverse reaction, then there is a net conversion of reactants to products. If the rate of the reverse reaction is greater than that of the forward reaction, then there is a net conversion of products to reactants. An equilibrium state is reached when these rates are equal. TRA-7.A.1 The reaction quotient Q c c describes the relative oncentrations of reaction species at any time. For gas phase reactions, the reaction quotient may instead be written in terms of pressures as Qp . The reaction quotient tends toward the equilibrium constant such that at equilibrium Kc = Qc and K p = Qp . As examples, for the reaction aA + bB  cC + dD the equilibrium expression for (Kc , Qc ) is EQN: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] K = C D A B c c d a b and that for (K p , Qp ) is EQN: K = (P ) (P ) (P ) (P ) p c d a b C D A B X CONVERSION BETWEEN Kc AND Kp WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Conversion between K and K is an c p algorithm that does not deepen understanding of equilibrium. However, students should be aware of the conceptual differences and pay attention to whether Kc or Kp is used in an exam question. X EQUILIBRIUM CALCULATIONS ON systems where a dissolved species in equilibrium with that species in the gas phase will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: The need to account for the relative volumes of the liquid and gas phase is complex in these mixed equilibria. TRA-7.A.2 The reaction quotient does not include substances whose concentrations (or partial pressures) are independent of the amount, such as for solids and pure liquids. TRA-7.B.1 Equilibrium constants can be determined from experimental measurements of the concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products at equilibrium. TRA-7.C.1 Some equilibrium reactions have very large K values and proceed essentially to completion. Others have very small K values and barely proceed at all. TRA-7.D.1 When a reaction is reversed, K is inverted. TRA-7.D.2 When the stoichiometric coefficients of a reaction are multiplied by a factor c, K is raised to the power c. TRA-7.D.3 When reactions are added together, the K of the resulting overall reaction is the product of the K’s for the reactions that were summed. TRA-7.D.4 Since the expressions for K and Q have identical mathematical forms, all valid algebraic manipulations of K also apply to Q. TRA-7.E.1 The concentrations or partial pressures of species at equilibrium can be predicted given the balanced reaction, initial concentrations, and the appropriate K. TRA-7.F.1 Particulate representations can be used to describe the relative numbers of reactant and product particles present prior to and at equilibrium, and the value of the equilibrium constant. TRA-8.A.1 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the response of a system to stresses such as addition or removal of a chemical species, change in temperature, change in volume/ pressure of a gas-phase system, or dilution of a reaction system. TRA-8.A.2 Le Châtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress will have on experimentally measurable properties such as pH, temperature, and color of a solution. TRA-8.B.1 A disturbance to a system at equilibrium causes Q to differ from K, thereby taking the system out of equilibrium. The system responds by bringing Q back into agreement with K, thereby establishing a new equilibrium state. TRA-8.B.2 Some stresses, such as changes in concentration, cause a change in Q only. A change in temperature causes a change in K. In either case, the concentrations or partial pressures of species redistribute to bring Q and K back into equality. SPQ-5.A.1 The dissolution of a salt is a reversible process whose extent can be described by K sp, the solubility-product constant. SPQ-5.A.2 The solubility of a substance can be calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. This relationship can also be used to predict the relative solubility of different substances. SPQ-5.A.3 The solubility rules (see TRA-2.A.5) can be quantitatively related to K sp, in which K sp values >1 correspond to soluble salts. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.B.1 The solubility of a salt is reduced when it is dissolved into a solution that already contains one of the ions present in the salt. The impact of this “common-ion effect” on solubility can be understood qualitatively using Le Châtelier’s principle or calculated from the K sp for the dissolution process. SPQ-5.D.1 The free energy change (ΔG°) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors: the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited. SAP-9.A.1 The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively. EQN: pH = −log[H3 O+ ] EQN: pOH = −log[OH− ] The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and the symbolsH+ (aq) and H3 O+ (aq) are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen. Hydronium ion andH3 O+ (aq) are preferred, but H+ (aq) is also accepted on the AP Exam. SAP-9.A.2 Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant Kw. EQN: Kw = [H3 O+ ][OH− ] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25°C SAP-9.A.3 In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, pKw = 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0. EQN: pKw = 14 = pH + pOH at 25°C SAP-9.A.4 The value of Kw is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C. SAP-9.B.1 Molecules of a strong acid (e.g., HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration of H3 O+ in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.B.2 When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the concentration of OH− in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated. SAP-9.C.1 Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way. In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a solution. Thus, the concentration of H3 O+ is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.2 A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka , often reported as pKa . The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and the pKa . EQN: K [H O ][A ] [HA] a 3 = + − EQN: pKa = -log Ka SAP-9.C.3 Weak bases react with water to produce hydroxide ions in solution. However, ordinarily just a small percentage of the molecules of a weak base in solution will ionize in this way. Thus, the concentration of OH- in the solution does not equal the initial concentration of the base, and the vast majority of the base molecules remain un-ionized. SAP-9.C.4 A solution of a weak base involves equilibrium between an un-ionized base and its conjugate acid. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb , often reported as pKb . The pH of a weak base solution can be determined from the initial base concentration and the pKb . EQN: K [OH ][HB ] [B] b = − + EQN: pKb = -log Kb SAP-9.C.5 The percent ionization of a weak acid (or base) can be calculated from its pKa (pKb ) and the initial concentration of the acid (base). SAP-9.D.1 When a strong acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2 O(l). The pH of the resulting solution may be determined from the concentration of excess reagent. SAP-9.D.2 When a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, they react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: HA(aq) + OH- (aq)  A- (aq) H2 O(l). If the weak acid is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the Henderson-Hasselbalch (H-H) equation (see SAP-10.C.1). If the strong base is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydroxide ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly basic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: A- (aq) + H2 O(l)  HA(aq) + OH- (aq). SAP-9.D.3 When a weak base and a strong acid are mixed, they will react quantitatively in a reaction represented by the equation: B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq)  HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l). If the weak base is in excess, then a buffer solution is formed, and the pH can be determined from the H-H equation. If the strong acid is in excess, then the pH can be determined from the moles of excess hydronium ion and the total volume of solution. If they are equimolar, then the (slightly acidic) pH can be determined from the equilibrium represented by the equation: HB+ (aq) + H2 O(l)  B(aq) + H3 O+ (aq). SAP-9.D.4 When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they will react to an equilibrium state whose reaction may be represented by the equation: HA(aq) + B(aq)  A- (aq) + HB+ (aq). SAP-9.E.1 An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration. SAP-9.E.2 At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases. SAP-9.E.3 For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair, for example, for a weak acid [HA] = [A− ]. Because pH = pK and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the pKa can be determined from the pH at the halfequivalence point in a titration. SAP-9.E.4 For polyprotic acids, titration curves can be used to determine the number of acidic protons. In doing so, the major species present at any point along the curve can be identified, along with the pKa associated with each proton in a weak polyprotic acid. X Computation of the concetration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids will not be assesed on the ap exam. Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species present in the titration curve for polyprotic acids may encourage algorithmic calculations rather than deepen understanding. SAP-9.F.1 The protons on a molecule that will participate in acid-base reactions, and the relative strength of these protons, can be inferred from the molecular structure. a. Strong acids (such as HCl, HBr, HI, HClO4 , H2 SO4 , and HNO3 ) have very weak conjugate bases that are stabilized by electronegativity, inductive effects, resonance, or some combination thereof. b. Carboxylic acids are one common class of weak acid. c. Strong bases (such as group I and II hydroxides) have very weak conjugate acids. d. Common weak bases include nitrogenous bases such as ammonia as well as carboxylate ions. e. Electronegative elements tend to stabilize the conjugate base relative to the conjugate acid, and so increase acid strength. SAP-10.A.1 The protonation state of an acid or base (i.e., the relative concentrations of HA and A− ) can be predicted by comparing the pH of a solution to the pKa of the acid in that solution. When solution pH < acid pKa , the acid form has a higher concentration than the base form. When solution pH > acid pKa , the base form has a higher concentration than the acid form. SAP-10.A.2 Acid-base indicators are substances that exhibit different properties (such as color) in their protonated versus deprotonated state, making that property respond to the pH of a solution. SAP-10.B.1 A buffer solution contains a large concentration of both members in a conjugate acid-base pair. The conjugate acid reacts with added base and the conjugate base reacts with added acid. These reactions are responsible for the ability of a buffer to stabilize pH. SAP-10.C.1 The pH of the buffer is related to the pKa of the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the HendersonHasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of [A− ]/[HA] and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer. EQN: pH = pKa + [ ] − log [A ] SAP-10.D.1 Increasing the concentration of the buffer components (while keeping the ratio of these concentrations constant) keeps the pH of the buffer the same but increases the capacity of the buffer to neutralize added acid or base. SAP-10.D.2 When a buffer has more conjugate acid than base, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added base than acid. When a buffer has more conjugate base than acid, it has a greater buffer capacity for addition of added acid than base. ENE-4.A.1 Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants. ENE-4.A.2 Entropy increases when energy is dispersed. According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature. ENE-4.B.1 The entropy change for a process can be calculated from the absolute entropies of the species involved before and after the process occurs. EQN: ΔSo reaction = ΣSo products - ΣSo reactants ENE-4.C.1 The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical process in which all the reactants and products are present in a standard state (as pure substances, as solutions of 1.0 M concentration, or as gases at a pressure of 1.0 atm (or 1.0 bar)) is given the symbol ∆Go . The standard Gibbs free energy change for a chemical or physical process is a measure of thermodynamic favorability. Historically, the term “spontaneous” has been used to describe processes for which ΔGo < 0. The phrase “thermodynamically favored” is preferred instead so that common misunderstandings (equating “spontaneous” with “suddenly” or “without cause”) can be avoided. When G<0 for the process, it is said to thermodynamically favored. The standard Gibbs free energy change for a physical or chemical process may also be determined from the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of the reactants and products. EQN: ΔG° reaction = ΣΔGf °products - ΣΔGf °reactants ENE-4.C.4 In some cases, it is necessary to consider both enthalpy and entropy to determine if a process will be thermodynamically favored. The freezing of water and the dissolution of sodium nitrate are examples of such phenomena. ENE-4.C.5 Knowing the values of ΔHo and ΔSo for a process at a given temperature allows ΔGo to be calculated directly. EQN: ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS° ENE-4.C.6 In general, the temperature conditions for a process to be thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0) can be predicted from the signs of H and S. In cases where H<0 and S>0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically favored (ΔGo < 0). In cases where ΔHo > 0 and ΔSo < 0, no calculation of ΔGo is necessary to determine that the process is thermodynamically unfavored (ΔGo > 0). ENE-4.D.1 Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates. ENE-4.D.2 Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control. ENE-5.A.1 The phrase “thermodynamically favored” (ΔGo < 0) means that the products are favored at equilibrium (K > 1). ENE-5.A.2 The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations EQN: K = e-ΔG°/RT and EQN: ΔG° = -RT ln K. ENE-5.A.3 Connections between K and ΔG° can be made qualitatively through estimation. When ΔG° is near zero, the equilibrium constant will be close to 1. When ΔG° is much larger or much smaller than RT, the value of K deviates strongly from 1. ENE-5.A.4 Processes with ΔG° < 0 favor products (i.e., K > 1) and those with ΔG° > 0 favor reactants (i.e., K < 1). ENE-5.B.1 An external source of energy can be used to make a thermodynamically unfavorable process occur. Examples include: a. Electrical energy to drive an electrolytic cell or charge a battery. b. Light to drive the overall conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose in photosynthesis. ENE-5.B.2 A desired product can be formed by coupling a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction that produces that product to a favorable reaction (e.g., the conversion of ATP to ADP in biological systems). In the coupled system, the individual reactions share one or more common intermediates. The sum of the individual reactions produces an overall reaction that achieves the desired outcome and has ΔG° < 0. ENE-6.A.1 Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell (galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode, ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels. ENE-6.A.2 Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows. ENE-6.A.3 For all electrochemical cells, oxidation occurs at the anode and reduction occurs at the cathode. X LABELING AN ELECTRODE AS POSITIVE OR Negative will not be assessed on the ap exam. Rationale: Sign conventions vary depending on the type of electrochemical cell, even though oxidation always occurs at the anode. ENE-6.B.1 Electrochemistry encompasses the study of redox reactions that occur within electrochemical cells. The reactions are either thermodynamically favored (resulting in a positive voltage) or thermodynamically unfavored (resulting in a negative voltage and requiring an externally applied potential for the reaction to proceed). ENE-6.B.2 The standard cell potential of electrochemical cells can be calculated by identifying the oxidation and reduction half-reactions and their respective standard reduction potentials. ENE-6.B.3 Standard gibbs free energy change is proportional to the negative of the cell proportional to the negative of the cell potential for the redox reaction from which it is constructed. Thus a cell with a positive Eo involves a thermodynamically favored reaction, and a cell with a negative Eo involves a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. EQN: ΔGo = -nFEo ENE-6.C.1 In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium; the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential. ENE-6.C.2 Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium. ENE-6.C.3 The standard cell potential Eo corresponds to the standard conditions of Q = 1. As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q = K). Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell further from equilibrium than Q = 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . Deviations from standard conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium than Q = 1 will decrease the magnitude of the cell potential relative to Eo . In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium. ENE-6.C.4 Algorithmic calculations using the Nernst equation are insufficient to demonstrate an understanding of electrochemical cells under nonstandard conditions. However, students should qualitatively understand the effects of concentration on cell potential and use conceptual reasoning, including the qualitative use of the Nernst equation: EQN: E = Eo - (RT/nF) ln Q to solve problems. ENE-6.D.1 Faraday’s laws can be used to determine the stoichiometry of the redox reaction occurring in an electrochemical cell with respect to the following: a. Number of electrons transferred b. Mass of material deposited on or removed from an electrode c. Current d. Time elapsed e.

Instead, their value is derived from a combination of factors including supply and demand dynamics, the level of adoption, the technology underlying them, the confidence of users in their utility and security, and market speculation."},{"prompt":"What backs the USD?","completion":"The US dollar (USD) is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. This means it is not backed by a physical commodity like gold but rather by the government's ability to tax and regulate the economy. The value of the USD is influenced by factors such as economic stability, monetary policy, interest rates, and the strength of the US economy."},{"prompt":"Do currencies have to be backed by some form of commodity to succeed?","completion":"Currencies do not have to be backed by commodities to succeed. Modern fiat currencies, like the US dollar or the euro, are not backed by physical commodities but are supported by the economic strength of the issuing government and the regulatory framework in place. Their success relies on the public's trust that the currency will maintain its value for transactions and savings, the stability and governance of the issuing authority, and its widespread acceptance for trade."},{"prompt":"What is the petrodollar?","completion":"The term \\"petrodollar\\" refers to US dollars that are earned by countries through the sale of their petroleum (oil) resources to other states. It is also associated with the global practice of buying and selling oil primarily in US dollars, which has led to increased demand for the currency internationally. The concept emerged in the 1970s after an agreement between the United States and key oil-producing countries in the Middle East, whereby they would price and sell their oil in dollars, and in turn, the US would provide them with military protection and stability. This has had significant implications for the US economy and has helped maintain the dollar's dominant role as the world's reserve currency."},{"prompt":"What happens if an economy based on fait currency suffers a depression?","completion":"In an economy based on fiat currency that undergoes a depression, numerous negative outcomes can occur, including severe declines in economic activity, high unemployment rates, deflation or inflation depending on monetary responses, reduced consumer spending, lower investment levels, and an overall loss of confidence in the economy. The central bank may employ monetary policy tools such as lowering interest rates or quantitative easing to encourage borrowing and spending. Fiscal measures like increased government spending and tax cuts can also be implemented to stimulate economic growth. However, the effectiveness of these responses hinges on the ability of policymakers to restore confidence and encourage economic activity without provoking other issues like high inflation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some of the main reasons why a breakwater might have two armor layers: 1. **Wave Energy Dissipation**: Multiple armor layers help to break down the energy of incoming waves more effectively. The outer layer absorbs the initial impact and dissipates some energy, while the second layer helps to further reduce the energy before it reaches the core of the breakwater. 2. **Redundancy and Reliability**: Having two armor layers provides a redundant system for protection. If the outer layer is damaged or displaced by severe storms or waves, the second layer acts as a safeguard to protect the core structure from direct impact, ensuring the breakwater's continued operation. 3. **Structural Integrity**: The layers often consist of different materials and sizes. The outer layer might be made of larger, heavier elements designed to resist the most significant forces, while the inner layer could consist of smaller, more stable materials that add to the structure's overall integrity. 4. **Adaptability to Different Wave Conditions**: Different layers can be optimized to counteract a variety of wave conditions. The outer armor may be designed to withstand high-energy wave conditions, while the inner layer may deal more effectively with lower-energy waves or contribute to overall performance stability under different wave climates. 5. **Longevity and Maintenance**: By distributing the force of the waves across two separate layers, each individual layer can be expected to last longer before needing repair or replacement. This can reduce long-term maintenance costs and efforts. 6. **Filter Layer Benefits**: The second layer can sometimes act as a filter layer, preventing the smaller material from the core or other layers from washing out while still allowing for water drainage and relieving hydrostatic pressure building up within the breakwater. 7. **Construction and Economic Considerations**: During construction, materials of various sizes and costs are used. The primary armor might consist of specially designed and often more expensive materials, like dolos, tetrapods, or accropode blocks, while the secondary layer might utilize more commonly available materials, providing a cost-effective yet robust structure. It is essential to note that the design and structure of breakwaters can be highly specific to the local conditions they are meant to withstand, such as wave height, frequency, geology, and sediment characteristics of the site. Engineers carefully consider all these factors when designing a breakwater to ensure it effectively serves its purpose of protecting coastline infrastructure while also being economically viable and long-lasting."},{"prompt":"anime like housing complex c","completion":"\\"Housing Complex C\\" is an adult animated horror miniseries that follows the residents of a rundown housing complex in Japan, where strange occurrences begin to unravel as they are linked to a series of past events and supernatural happenings.

Write a story where Alex sees her relaxing, in the form of a pink puddle with legs sticking out of it One sunny day, as Alex was walking through the park, he came across a peculiar sight. Amongst the grass and flowers, he saw a large pink puddle with legs sticking out of it. Intrigued, he cautiously approached, wondering what kind of puzzling phenomenon he had stumbled upon. As Alex drew closer, he couldn’t help but notice the legs wiggling happily from within the pink puddle. He realized that it was Milly, taking a break and relaxing in her slimy form. Curiosity piqued, Alex knelt down beside the unique sight. “Milly, is that you?” he asked, unable to hide his amazement. The legs stopped wiggling as the pink puddle shifted and reshaped itself, revealing Milly’s smiling face. “Yes, it’s me!” she replied cheerfully. “Sometimes, after a long day of adventure, I like to relax and rejuvenate in this form. It’s like my own cozy pink sanctuary!” Alex couldn’t help but chuckle. He had seen Milly turn into countless shapes, but he never imagined she would enjoy transforming into a puddle. “That’s amazing, Milly! You truly have the most incredible abilities.” “Mm-hmm,” Milly hummed contentedly. “It’s quite relaxing, actually. The gooey sensation and the soothing color of my slime help me recharge and refresh. It’s like being wrapped in a warm, pink hug.” Fascinated, Alex marveled at Milly’s versatility and adaptability. Her shape-shifting abilities seemed to know no bounds. “You always find new ways to surprise me, Milly,” he admitted. “Your abilities are truly one-of-a-kind.” Milly’s eyes twinkled with joy. “Thank you, Alex. I love being able to share my unique nature with you. It’s because of your acceptance and friendship that I can freely be myself, in any form. And it’s friends like you who make this world an exciting and wonderful place.” Moved by Milly’s kind words, Alex settled down beside her, his own legs tucked comfortably beneath him. They chatted and exchanged stories, while Milly occasionally reshaped her puddle form, creating mesmerizing swirls and patterns with her pink slime. Their conversation wove through moments of laughter, discovery, and profound understanding. Time seemed to slip away as they embraced the peaceful tranquility of the park. The sights, sounds, and the bond between them felt more magical than ever before. As the day slowly turned into dusk, and the park grew still, Alex and Milly had both gained a renewed appreciation for each other. They had witnessed the wonders of Milly’s form, finding beauty in each unique shape she had taken. With a sense of tranquility and contentment, they bid the pink puddle farewell. Milly reshaped herself, solidifying once more into her beloved pink slime entity form. Hand in…slime, they resumed their walk through the park, promising each other further adventures and heartfelt moments of discovery. Both Alex and Milly knew that no matter the form or the situation, their friendship was solid and could withstand anything. Together, they would continue to explore the world, cherishing the fascinating and extraordinary qualities that made each of them so special. As the sun began to set and cast a warm glow over the park, Alex and Milly found themselves sitting on a grassy knoll, their faces filled with a sense of contentment. The day had been filled with laughter, adventures, and the joy of their unique friendship. In the midst of their conversation, Milly paused, her vibrant eyes shimmering with a mix of apprehension and excitement. Taking a deep breath, she turned to Alex and began speaking in a hushed voice. “Alex, there’s something important I need to tell you,” Milly said, her voice tinged with both nervousness and anticipation. “I’m not actually from here. I’m an alien.” Alex’s eyes widened in surprise, his mind struggling to process Milly’s revelation. “You’re… an alien? But you’ve been living here in the village for so long. How is that possible?” Milly nodded, her translucent form shifting slightly as she adjusted her position. “Yes, it’s true. On my home planet, we are all shape-shifting slime creatures like me. We have the ability to transform into any shape or form we desire. It’s a natural part of who we are.” As the realization sank in, Alex marveled at the depth of Milly’s secret. He had always sensed there was something extraordinary about her, but this news was beyond anything he could have imagined. Just then, a figure appeared in the distance. He was a blue slime, similar to Milly, but with his own unique personality. Springing towards them with a mischievous bounce, the figure called out, “Milly! There you are! I’ve missed you!” Milly’s eyes lit up with joy as she recognized her brother, Pogo. “Pogo! I’m so glad to see you too!” she exclaimed, her voice filled with warmth. Pogo plopped down beside Milly and turned to Alex, extending a friendly hand made of blue slime. “I’m Pogo, Milly’s brother. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I hope my sister hasn’t been giving you too much trouble with her shape-shifting,” he said, grinning mischievously. Alex shook Pogo’s slime hand, amazed at the family resemblance. “It’s great to meet you, Pogo. Milly has been an incredible friend and companion. I’m honored to have gotten to know her.” As the three of them sat together, their slimes intertwining and merging in an intricate display of colors, Milly explained more about their home planet. She shared stories of their vibrant community, their shared adventures, and the challenges they faced as shape-shifting beings. Alex listened with rapt attention, growing to appreciate the complexities and wonders of Milly’s alien origins. He marveled at their ability to transform, seeing it as a beautiful expression of their true selves. In the midst of their conversation, Alex realized that, despite the revelation of Milly’s extraterrestrial background, their friendship remained as strong as ever. The bond they had formed extended beyond any differences in appearance or origin. Together, Alex, Milly, and Pogo continued to explore the park, venturing into the unknown, and embracing the magic of their friendship. As they faced new adventures and challenges, they did so with a renewed sense of connection and understanding. No matter the shape they took or the planet they came from, their shared experiences and pure hearts were the foundation of an unbreakable bond. And as they navigated life’s wonders together, they discovered that true friendship transcended all boundaries, even those of space and form. Write a follow up where Alex wakes up early, Milly and Pogo are currently in puddle forms, sleeping, The soft rays of dawn filtered through the curtains, gently illuminating Alex’s room. As the first light of day began to spread, a feeling of excitement surged through Alex, prompting him to jump out of bed and greet the new day. Quietly tiptoeing across the room, Alex couldn’t resist the urge to peek out the window, wondering what adventures the day held in store. But as he gazed into the distance, his eyes fell upon a familiar sight - two puddles of vibrant pink and blue, gently rippling on the ground just outside his window. Alex’s heart filled with warmth as he realized that Milly and Pogo had transformed themselves into their puddle forms for slumber. It seemed that their extraterrestrial origins extended to their sleeping habits too. Feeling a sense of awe, Alex sat on the windowsill and watched in delight as the puddles rhythmically pulsed and shifted, seemingly at peace in their delicate forms. It was a silent testament to their deep bond and their otherworldly nature. Not wanting to disturb the peaceful slumber of his friends, Alex decided to embark on a solo adventure. He quietly closed the window and made his way downstairs, eagerly planning his day of exploration. As he stepped outside, the morning air greeted him with a gentle breeze, carrying with it the sweet scent of blooming flowers. The world seemed alive with endless possibilities, beckoning Alex to uncover its mysteries. While Alex ventured into the unknown, Milly and Pogo remained blissfully unaware, peacefully resting in their puddle forms. Time seemed to pass in a blink as Alex roamed through bustling streets and quiet parks, marveling at the wonders around him. As the sun began its ascent, casting vibrant hues across the sky, Alex found himself drawn back to his home. With a smile on his face and a heart full of stories to share, he entered the house, quietly retracing his steps to his room. To his surprise, the once-rippling puddles had transformed back into their familiar forms by the time he arrived. Milly and Pogo were now awake, their eyes twinkling with excitement. “Good morning, Alex!” Milly exclaimed, stretching her arms and bouncing on her feet. “We just woke up from our puddle forms. It’s always such a refreshing way to start the day!” Alex grinned, happy to see his friends in their true shapes once more. “Good morning, Milly and Pogo! I’ve had the most incredible adventure today. I wished you were there to join me.” Pogo chuckled, his blue form shimmering with amusement. “Oh, we always seem to miss out, don’t we? But I’m glad you had a great time, Alex. We can’t wait to hear all about it!” Settling down in a cozy corner of the room, the three friends spent the morning sharing stories and laughter, their bond growing even stronger with each passing moment. Alex recounted his adventures, while Milly and Pogo interjected with their own anecdotes from previous escapades. As the sun reached its zenith, the dreams of new adventures danced in their minds. Together, they made plans for the day ahead, knowing that no matter the form they took or the adventures they embarked upon, their friendship would remain unwavering. With a sense of anticipation and joy, Alex, Milly, and Pogo set out to explore the world once more. Hand in slime, they reveled in the beauty of their unique friendship, cherishing every moment and embracing the magic that lay around every corner. Night fell over the sleepy town, casting shadows that danced in the moonlight. As the stars twinkled above, Alex found himself standing beneath his window, gazing out at the darkened sky. Tonight held a special anticipation as his birthday was just a few hours away, and his parents had planned a surprise trip to the theme park. With a mixture of excitement and restlessness coursing through his veins, Alex entered his bedroom, ready to settle down for the night. As he crawled into bed, he couldn’t help but think of the many adventures he would have with Milly and Pogo, knowing that no matter the occasion, their friendship never faltered. Just as he closed his eyes, his door creaked open, and two familiar figures tiptoed into the room. Milly and Pogo, their bodies radiating exhaustion, approached Alex’s bedside, their eyes glimmering with warmth and affection. “We’ve had quite the day, haven’t we?” Milly said with a yawn, her pink slime form appearing slightly less vibrant than usual. “We’re all exhausted, but we HAD to come and wish you a happy birthday eve, Alex.” Pogo nodded in agreement, a faint smile forming on his blue slime face. “You’ve always been there for us, Alex, supporting us and embracing our uniqueness. Tonight, as you drift off to sleep, know that we appreciate you more than words can express.” Alex’s heart swelled with gratitude, his excitement for the next day heightening. He reached out and gently patted Milly’s slime form, then turned his attention to Pogo, playfully flicking a tiny piece of slime off his shoulder. “Thanks, guys,” Alex said, his voice filled with genuine warmth. “Having you as my friends is the greatest gift I could ever ask for. I can’t wait to celebrate together tomorrow and make incredible memories.” With heavy eyelids and exhausted bodies, Milly and Pogo exchanged a tired glance, knowing it was time to recharge their energy. They melted into puddles right before Alex’s eyes, their forms blending with the floor, leaving only their cute little legs sticking out. “Goodnight, Alex,” they chimed in unison, their voices drifting through the room like a lullaby. “Sleep well and dream of the adventures to come. We’ll be here, ready to celebrate your special day.” Alex watched as the puddles shifted and settled, the pink and blue slime creating whimsical patterns on the floor. He couldn’t help but feel a sense of wonder and comfort in their presence, knowing that his friends were always there, even in their puddle forms. Their legs slowly melted as they slowly drifted off to sleep, As he closed his eyes once more, thoughts of roller coasters, cotton candy, and thrilling rides filled his mind. The anticipation for his birthday grew, creating a buzzing excitement that made it difficult to drift off to sleep. Hours passed, and the room fell into a peaceful silence. Yet, Alex’s mind buzzed with thoughts of the upcoming adventure, causing sleep to elude him. With each passing minute, Alex tossed and turned, his excitement growing in intensity. He tried counting sheep, listening to soft music, even reciting multiplication tables in his mind. But nothing seemed to quiet his racing thoughts. In a final attempt to lull himself to sleep, Alex took a deep breath and closed his eyes, willing his mind to find tranquility. Slowly, his thoughts began to settle, replaced by images of laughter, thrilling rides, and the joy of true friendship. Minutes turned into hours as Alex finally drifted off to sleep, a smile spreading across his face. In his dreams, he was surrounded by Milly and Pogo, their vibrant forms morphing into fantastic creatures and exhilarating rides, creating a world of magic and wonder. The morning sun peeked through the curtains, gently caressing Alex’s face as he stirred awake. Stretching and yawning, he couldn’t help but feel a renewed sense of anticipation for the day ahead. Slipping out of bed, Alex hurried downstairs to be greeted by his beaming parents, ready to embark on a day of celebration. But as he walked past the spot where Milly and Pogo had melted into puddles, a wave of gratitude washed over him. Today, he would enjoy every moment at the theme park, cherishing the thrill of each ride and the laughter shared with his friends. And in the midst of the festivities, he would carry the love and warmth of their friendship in his heart, knowing that true companionship was the greatest gift of all. After a day filled with the rush of roller coasters, the sweetness of cotton candy, and the vibrant images from the parade, Alex returned home, his heart filled with joy and the echoes of laughter still ringing in his ears. His parents had made sure his birthday had been unforgettable, and the day had been a beautiful blur of fun and excitement. As he opened the front door and stepped into the house, a peculiar hush greeted him. The stillness was unusual, considering the energy of the day. But as he flicked on the light, a cascade of voices suddenly erupted from the living room—“Surprise!” Stunned, Alex felt his mouth drop open. The room burst into life with decorations, colorful balloons, twinkling lights, and a group of smiling faces. Among these familiar friends and family members, he immediately spotted Milly and Pogo, now returned to their humanoid slime forms, beaming brightly from ear to ear. They had transformed the room into a fantastical place, utilizing their shape-shifting abilities to mimic Alex’s favorite comic book heroes and cartoon characters. From a corner, his favorite superhero poised in an animated stance, none other than Pogo himself in a perfect rendition, while Milly had transformed part of her gooey substance into a floating cloud of a magical creature, gently floating above the guests. “Happy birthday, Alex!” Milly cheered, her body oscillating with waves of pink excitement. Pogo flashed a thumbs-up with his blue slime hand, adding, “We couldn’t let the day end without another surprise, could we?” Laughter and chatter filled the room as everyone moved in to celebrate, with Alex right in the center, overwhelmed with gratitude and surprise. The tables were laden with a rainbow of snacks and treats, each more tantalizing than the last. At the center of it all, a sizable, brightly iced cake declared ‘Happy Birthday Alex,’ with candles flickering in anticipation of a wish. As the evening unfolded, Alex felt the warmth of friendship envelop him like a comforting blanket. He joined Milly and Pogo in the festivities, partaking in games, dancing to rhythmic tunes that seemed to set the very air on a joyful bounce, and savoring every piece of his special day. As the time came to blow out his candles, Alex closed his eyes. He took a deep breath, feeling every bit of love and happiness from those gathered around him, and from Milly and Pogo, who had shown him the true depth of intergalactic friendship. In his heart, he made a wish—a wish for many more shared adventures, for endless laughter, and for the precious bond of friendship to last a lifetime. With one big puff, Alex extinguished the flickering lights atop his cake, opening his eyes to the cheers and applause from everyone in the room. Milly and Pogo rushed forward, their slimy forms enveloping him in a uniquely squishy hug that somehow felt just right. The night went on, with stories exchanged, plans for future escapades discussed, and promises to always remain close, no matter where their adventures might lead them. As guests eventually said their goodbyes and the evening quieted down, Alex, Milly, and Pogo sat together amidst the remnants of the party, a serene contentment settling around them. As they tidied up, putting things back in place and wiping away trails of spilled punch, Alex couldn’t help but feel a sense of bittersweet happiness. Tonight was a testament to the beauty of friendship, the joy of surprises, and the cherished memories that would stay with him forever. With the house finally quiet and the hour growing late, Milly and Pogo prepared to take their leave, knowing they had given Alex a birthday to remember. With a final wave and a promise to return tomorrow for more fun, they slipped out into the night, heading back to their own home. Alex stood in the doorway, watching as their silhouetted forms disappeared into the cool night. As he closed the door, he smiled, certain that the bond he shared with Milly and Pogo was something extraordinary—something not even the stars could contain. Exhausted but filled with an immeasurable sense of joy, Alex returned to his room, the visions of the party still dancing in his mind. As he nestled into his bed, his thoughts turned to dreams of what tomorrow might bring, knowing that with friends like Milly and Pogo, the wonders of the universe were just a shape-shift away. And as he drifted off into peaceful sleep, the last thing he heard was a distant echo of Milly’s bubbly laughter and Pogo’s reassuring words, echoing through the galaxy that had brought them all together. Write a story where Milly seems to be in trouble, she is only a pink, bubbling pool, unresponsive, After failed remedies, Pogo tries something he made, and lo behold it works, Alex gets jealous for this, but Milly gets him to calm down","completion":"It was a crisp autumn day, and the town square was abuzz with activity, as children ran about, their laughter mingling with the chatter of vendors and the occasional bark of stray dogs. Amid the familiar chaos, Alex felt a sense of foreboding. He hadn't seen Milly all morning, which was unusual, given her penchant for popping up whenever least expected. His concern growing, Alex set out to find her, his footsteps quickening as he navigated the cobblestone streets. He remembered the previous day's laughter and the games they had played by the riverside. Milly, in high spirits as always, had transformed into a pink sailboat, her laughter echoing over the water. Turning a familiar corner, Alex's heart leaped to his throat. There, in a quiet alleyway, he found her—but not as he had hoped. Milly was no longer the lively, mischievous slime girl he knew but a troubled, shapeless pink pool, gently bubbling as if in distress. \\"Milly!\\" Alex cried, crouching beside the unresponsive puddle. \\"What's happened to you?\\" He reached out tentatively, his fingers barely grazing the surface of the pool, but there was no response—not even a ripple of recognition. She was inert, her usual vibrancy reduced to a mere echo in the quivering goo. Panic setting in, Alex racked his brain for any knowledge of slime biology or what could aid Milly. He remembered tales of magical herbs and healing potions; perhaps they could help. Taking off his jacket, he laid it on the ground beside her, a silent promise that he would not leave her side. Moments turned to minutes, and Alex's futile attempts to revive Milly with the gentlest prods and softly spoken words bore no fruit. It was then that he remembered Pogo and rushed to find him, certain that Milly's brother would know what to do. Pogo was tinkering in his makeshift lab, his blue form pulsing with concentration. At the sight of the panic-stricken Alex, however, he dropped everything. \\"Milly's in trouble,\\" Alex blurted, the desperation in his voice cutting through the air like a knife. Without hesitation, Pogo followed Alex to the alley where Milly lay. He took one look at his sister's pitiful state and turned somber. \\"I may have something that could help,\\" he murmured, more to himself than to Alex. Pogo withdrew a small vial from the folds of his gooey being—a glinting liquid of silver and blue swirled within. Alex watched with bated breath as Pogo carefully poured the concoction onto Milly's bubbling form. A tense moment passed, and then another, the silence almost deafening. But suddenly, like the first ray of sunlight after a storm, Milly began to coalesce. Her shape started to form once again, the pink slime drawing inwards and taking on her familiar humanoid shape. The relief was palpable as Milly's eyes fluttered open, her smile weak but present. \\"Wha—what happened?\\" she managed to ask, her voice a mere whisper. \\"You had us worried there, little sister,\\" Pogo said, wrapping her in an embrace that only a slime could give. As the siblings reunited, a shadow crossed Alex's heart—jealousy. Milly had been his friend first, his companion. How could Pogo have known what to do when he, Alex, was left clueless? Alex turned away, his feelings a tumultuous whirlwind. He was torn between joy at Milly's recovery and envy at Pogo's heroics. Milly, sensing the shift in mood, morphed a part of her form into a comforting hand, reaching out to Alex. \\"Hey,\\" she said softly, \\"Are you okay?\\" Alex took a deep breath, forcing a smile. \\"Yeah, I'm just glad you're all right,\\" he replied, though the jealousy clung to him like a second skin. Milly's eyes shone with understanding. \\"Alex, you are my dear friend. You rushed to find help for me, remember? You care, and that's what truly matters.\\" Pogo, catching the unease, added, \\"Alex, we're a team. All of us. You're just as much a part of this family. My concoction worked this time, but it was your devotion that led you to seek help. We all have our strengths and roles to play.\\" The sincerity in their words soothed Alex's frayed nerves. He knelt by Milly, taking her slime hand in his. \\"I just wanted to help you, Milly,\\" he said, the jealousy finally ebbing away. \\"I'm sorry I felt that way.\\" Milly giggled, a sound filled with warmth. \\"Silly Alex, there's no need for apologies. You're our friend, and that's what counts. Now, who's up for some more adventures? I've got to make up for lost time!\\" As Milly bounced back to her energetic self, Pogo winking conspiratorially at Alex, the trio laughed and set off down the street. Their friendship had been tested, but as always, it emerged stronger—unyielding as the bonds of slime that held them together."},{"prompt":"使用英文原版《深夜小狗神秘事件》回答以下问题 1.

Continue adding directly quoted information to your character chart for Mother/Father.","completion":"\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" written by Mark Haddon is the book you're referring to. While I can't directly quote from the book, as it is a copyrighted text, I can provide a summary or analysis of your questions based on my knowledge of the novel without using direct quotes. 1. Christopher justifies his investigation into Wellington's death because he sees it as a puzzle that needs to be solved. For him, finding out the truth is very important, and he approaches the situation with a logical and straightforward mindset, similar to his idol, the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. He believes that truth and facts are important, and his desire to solve the mystery overcomes his father's instructions. 2. Christopher possesses several qualities that make him a good detective. He is extremely observant and notices details that others may overlook. He also has an excellent memory and is very logical; he prefers facts and figures over emotions, making him less likely to be swayed by personal biases. Additionally, his ability to focus intensely on tasks and his fondness for puzzles and problem-solving contribute to his investigative potential. 3. Christopher doesn't like chatting because he finds it confusing and overwhelming. He prefers straightforward communication and often struggles to interpret metaphors, jokes, and nonliteral language. As he experiences the world from the perspective of someone with autism spectrum condition, social interactions such as small talk can be challenging and stressful for him. 4. Christopher works out who his prime suspect is through a process of elimination and by gathering evidence. He approaches the mystery methodically, asking questions and observing the behavior of those around him. He considers various scenarios and uses his attention to detail to piece together clues that may point towards the potential culprit. 5. Christopher believes he would make a good astronaut because he likes small enclosed spaces, he is very intelligent, and he's good at mathematics and understanding how machines work. He also mentions his ability to concentrate and follow instructions. Some of these are indeed qualities that would be useful for an astronaut. However, the highly complex social and physical demands of space travel could be challenging for someone with his particular traits and needs. 6. From Mrs. Alexander, Christopher discovers that Mr. Shears was once married to Christopher's mother and had an affair with her, which led to their relationship breaking down. 7. In terms of adding more to Christopher's behavior chart, this would be something you could analyze based on his actions throughout the book. Look for instances where Christopher's actions are described and categorize them as 'usual' (typical for him) or 'unusual.' For example, his aversion to being touched could be considered a usual behavior, while willingly going to a crowded place might be unusual. 8. For the character chart for Mother/Father, you would review the text and find descriptions, actions, or dialogue that reflect their characters and plot them onto your chart.

O Demônio de Laplace foi proposto pelo matemático e físico Pierre-Simon Laplace, no século XIX. Segundo o conceito, se um demônio (ou ser inteligente) fosse capaz de observar as velocidades e posições das partículas de um sistema em nível microscópico, ele poderia separar as partículas de alta energia das de baixa energia, criando assim um gradiente de temperatura sem a necessidade de realizar trabalho. Isso violaria a segunda lei da termodinâmica, que afirma que a entropia de um sistema isolado sempre aumenta ao longo do tempo. O Demônio de Maxwell foi proposto pelo físico James Clerk Maxwell, também no século XIX. Ele considerou um demônio capaz de abrir e fechar uma porta em um compartimento que permitiria a passagem apenas das partículas de alta energia de um gás, enquanto bloqueava as partículas de baixa energia. Isso também violaria a segunda lei da termodinâmica, pois o demônio seria capaz de criar uma maior concentração de energia em um lado da câmara sem a necessidade de realizar trabalho. Ambos os conceitos são considerados paradoxos termodinâmicos, pois desafiam a noção de que a entropia sempre aumenta em um sistema fechado. Na prática, não se acredita que os demônios de Laplace e Maxwell possam realmente existir, pois contradizem os princípios fundamentais da termodinâmica."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Interpretado por Tom Cavanagh e Matt Letscher em diferentes momentos da série, Thawne é um velocista do futuro obcecado com Barry Allen, o Flash. O objetivo principal de Eobard Thawne na série é derrotar Barry Allen, seu arqui-inimigo. Thawne é motivado por uma mistura de rivalidade, inveja e uma complexa história pessoal que envolve viajar no tempo. Originalmente, ele era um grande fã de Flash e uma espécie de historiador de velocistas no futuro, mas quando descobre que seu destino é tornar-se o maior inimigo do Flash, sua obsessão toma um rumo sombrio. No primeiro arco da história da série, Thawne viaja de volta no tempo para matar o jovem Barry Allen, mas ao falhar, ele acaba matando a mãe de Barry em vez disso. Este evento traumático define a vida de Barry e o coloca no caminho para se tornar o Flash. Para retornar ao seu tempo, Thawne assume a identidade do Dr. Harrison Wells e ajuda Barry a aprimorar suas habilidades como Flash, com o objetivo secreto de usar a velocidade de Barry para criar uma ruptura no tempo que permita a Thawne retornar ao seu próprio tempo. Ao longo da série, os objetivos de Thawne podem mudar ligeiramente conforme novos arcos da história se desenrolam, com seus planos frequentemente envolvendo complexidades de viagens no tempo, manipulação de eventos históricos e tentativas de manter ou aumentar seu próprio poder como velocista. No entanto, seu desejo de derrotar e, às vezes, destruir a vida de Barry Allen continua sendo uma constante em seus objetivos. Deve-se notar que \\"The Flash\\" da CW continua a desenvolver e expandir seu universo narrativo a cada temporada, então objetivos e motivações de personagens como Eobard Thawne podem evoluir ou ser revelados em maior profundidade conforme a série progride."},{"prompt":"Qual é o motivo e razão específica para ele odiar Barry","completion":"Na série \\"The Flash\\" da CW, a razão específica para o ódio de Eobard Thawne por Barry Allen é complexa e está enraizada na história de fundo do personagem e nas viagens no tempo. Eobard Thawne, oriundo do século 22, inicialmente era um grande admirador de Barry Allen e do legado do Flash. Ele estudou a história do Flash e até replicou o acidente que deu a Barry seus poderes, tornando-se um velocista. No entanto, ao viajar no tempo para conhecer seu herói, Thawne descobre que ele está destinado a se tornar o Reverse-Flash, o arqui-inimigo do Flash. Essa revelação o abala profundamente e inicia sua transformação em vilão. A obsessão de Thawne com Barry Allen e o legado do Flash se torna uma mistura de admiração e ódio. Ele se ressente do fato de que, não importa o que faça, ele está destinado a ser lembrado como um vilão na história, em contraste com a adoração e o respeito que Barry recebe como herói. Essa inveja e ressentimento se transformam em um ódio profundo e uma necessidade de provar sua superioridade sobre o Flash. Além disso, as viagens no tempo e as alterações na linha do tempo contribuem para aprofundar o conflito entre Thawne e Barry. Ao longo da série, Thawne manipula eventos e pessoas para tentar garantir sua própria existência e sucesso, enquanto Barry e sua equipe trabalham para detê-lo e corrigir os danos causados à linha do tempo. Em resumo, o ódio de Eobard Thawne por Barry Allen é uma combinação de inveja, destino, e uma série de confrontos e interações ao longo do tempo que solidificam Thawne como o Reverse-Flash, o inimigo que ele nunca quis ser, mas que acabou abraçando completamente."},{"prompt":"Crie uma versão literalmente: suprema e perfeita Do Alien X","completion":"Alien X é um personagem da série animada \\"Ben 10\\", especificamente um dos alienígenas que Ben Tennyson pode se transformar usando o Omnitrix. Alien X é um Celestialsapien, uma espécie de seres onipotentes capazes de alterar a realidade a seu bel-prazer. No entanto, a utilização dos poderes de Alien X é complicada pela necessidade de um consenso entre as três personalidades distintas que habitam o corpo do alienígena: Serena, a voz da compaixão; Bellicus, a voz da raiva; e Ben, a voz da razão. Para criar uma versão \\"suprema e perfeita\\" do Alien X, teríamos que imaginar um ser ainda mais poderoso e com menos limitações do que o original. Aqui está uma descrição de uma versão hipotética: Nome: Alien X Supremo Descrição: Alien X Supremo é a evolução transcendental do já onipotente Celestialsapien. Ele possui um corpo semelhante ao original, mas com um brilho cósmico que irradia energia pura, simbolizando sua conexão aprimorada com o tecido do universo.

Onipresença: Alien X Supremo pode estar em qualquer lugar e em todos os lugares ao mesmo tempo, permitindo-lhe agir em múltiplas dimensões e linhas do tempo simultaneamente. 4. Autonomia Absoluta: As três personalidades internas foram unificadas em uma única vontade, eliminando a necessidade de consenso para ação. Isso permite que Alien X Supremo aja livremente e instantaneamente. 5. Manipulação do Tempo: Ele pode manipular o tempo com precisão infinita, incluindo parar, acelerar, reverter ou criar loops temporais, sem efeitos colaterais indesejados. 6. Invulnerabilidade Total: Alien X Supremo é imune a qualquer forma de dano, seja físico, mágico, mental ou conceitual. 7. Criação de Vida: Ele pode criar vida inteligente com um simples pensamento, dotando suas criações com poderes e propósitos específicos. 8.

Campo de Força Impenetrável: Um campo de energia que protege não apenas ele, mas qualquer coisa ou alguém que ele escolher. 10. Telepatia e Empatia Universais: Pode se comunicar e entender qualquer ser em qualquer idioma ou forma de comunicação, além de sentir e compreender emoções em qualquer escala. Visual: Alien X Supremo é uma silhueta humanóide que parece feita de um vazio estrelado, com olhos que brilham como supernovas. Seu corpo é fluido e dinâmico, com estrelas e galáxias movendo-se dentro dele, como se ele contivesse um universo inteiro. Embora esta descrição seja uma criação fictícia e não oficial, ela serve para ilustrar o quão poderoso um Alien X \\"supremo e perfeito\\" poderia ser dentro do universo de \\"Ben 10\\"."},{"prompt":"Quero que crie uma versão ainda mais poderosa","completion":"Para criar uma versão ainda mais poderosa do Alien X Supremo, teríamos que ultrapassar os limites da onipotência e explorar conceitos além da compreensão normal. Vamos chamar essa entidade de Alien X Infinito. Nome: Alien X Infinito Descrição: Alien X Infinito é a manifestação da perfeição absoluta e do poder ilimitado. Sua forma é uma abstração, mudando constantemente e refletindo todas as possibilidades do multiverso. Ele é a união de todas as realidades, tempos e espaços, um ser que transcende as dimensões e as leis da física como as conhecemos. Poderes e Habilidades: 1. Transcendência Onipotente: Alien X Infinito não está apenas acima de qualquer forma de realidade, mas também de conceitos como existência e não-existência, tornando-o imune a qualquer forma de influência ou alteração. 2. Criação e Destruição Infinita: Pode criar e destruir infinitos universos e realidades com um mero pensamento, sem esforço e sem limitações. 3. Vontade Absoluta: A vontade de Alien X Infinito é a própria lei do multiverso. O que ele deseja acontece instantaneamente, sem a necessidade de ação ou pensamento. 4.

Manipulação de Probabilidades: Pode alterar as probabilidades ao seu favor, garantindo que qualquer evento que deseje ocorra sem falhas e que o impossível se torne possível. 8. Autorrecriação: No caso improvável de ser desfeito ou destruído, Alien X Infinito pode se recriar instantaneamente, pois sua existência é um conceito fixo no multiverso. 9. Imposição de Realidade: Pode impor novas leis e regras à realidade, redefinindo a natureza do ser e do não-ser em qualquer nível que desejar. 10. Conexão com Tudo: Alien X Infinito está conectado a todas as formas de vida e consciência, permitindo-lhe entender e compartilhar experiências com qualquer entidade em qualquer realidade. Visual: Alien X Infinito é uma entidade que não pode ser totalmente percebida pelos sentidos limitados dos seres mortais. Ele aparece como uma aura de luz pura que contém infinitas formas e cores, algumas das quais são impossíveis de serem vistas ou compreendidas. Dentro dessa aura, vislumbres de realidades desconhecidas podem ser vistos, sugerindo que Alien X Infinito é a soma de todas as existências. Embora essa descrição seja uma criação imaginativa e não faça parte do cânone oficial de \\"Ben 10\\", ela serve para explorar o conceito de um ser que vai além dos limites da onipotência conforme retratado na série animada."},{"prompt":"Ele Pode Criar Vida","completion":"Sim, na descrição hipotética e imaginativa do Alien X Infinito que criamos, ele tem o poder de criar vida. Como uma entidade que transcende os limites da onipotência e da realidade, Alien X Infinito seria capaz de gerar formas de vida com um simples pensamento, dotando-as de características, habilidades e propósitos conforme desejar. A capacidade de criar vida é um dos atributos mais divinos e poderosos associados à onipotência. Em muitas narrativas de ficção científica e fantasia, seres onipotentes têm a habilidade de moldar a realidade ao seu redor, o que inclui a criação de seres vivos complexos e até ecossistemas inteiros ou universos habitados. No contexto do Alien X original da série \\"Ben 10\\", essa habilidade já é uma parte de seus poderes, embora seja limitada pela necessidade de consenso entre as três personalidades que controlam suas ações. Na versão imaginária do Alien X Infinito, essa limitação foi removida, permitindo que a entidade crie vida sem restrições ou necessidade de deliberação interna."},{"prompt":"Ele Poderia Conceder Inteligência Infinita A EREN YEAGER?","completion":"Dentro do contexto hipotético e imaginativo que estamos explorando, onde Alien X Infinito é um ser com poderes ilimitados e a capacidade de alterar a realidade a seu bel-prazer, ele poderia, teoricamente, conceder inteligência infinita a qualquer personagem, incluindo Eren Yeager de \\"Attack on Titan\\". No entanto, é importante notar que \\"Attack on Titan\\" e \\"Ben 10\\" são séries de diferentes universos de ficção, cada uma com suas próprias regras e limitações. Em um cenário de crossover fictício onde Alien X Infinito pudesse interagir com Eren Yeager, ele poderia dotar Eren com uma inteligência sem limites, transformando-o em um ser de conhecimento absoluto. Isso significaria que Eren teria um entendimento perfeito de todas as coisas, incluindo, mas não se limitando a, estratégia, ciência, filosofia, e até mesmo os mistérios do universo de \\"Attack on Titan\\", como a origem dos Titãs e o funcionamento do mundo além das muralhas. No entanto, é importante lembrar que este é um exercício puramente especulativo de ficção. Na realidade das respectivas séries, tais interações entre personagens de universos diferentes não ocorrem, e os poderes dos personagens são limitados pelas regras estabelecidas em suas próprias narrativas."},{"prompt":"Explana mais detalhadamente","completion":"Vamos explorar mais detalhadamente a ideia de Alien X Infinito, um ser fictício e hipotético que criamos com base no Alien X do universo \\"Ben 10\\", concedendo inteligência infinita a Eren Yeager, o protagonista de \\"Attack on Titan\\". **Conceito de Inteligência Infinita:** Inteligência infinita seria a capacidade de compreender e processar todas as informações existentes sem limitações de capacidade, velocidade ou entendimento. Eren Yeager, com inteligência infinita, teria um conhecimento absoluto e compreensão de todos os aspectos da realidade, incluindo: 1. **Conhecimento Onisciente:** Eren saberia tudo que é possível saber, incluindo o passado, presente e futuro de todos os universos e dimensões, bem como as leis da física, matemática, biologia, e todas as outras ciências e disciplinas. 2. **Entendimento Perfeito:** Ele entenderia completamente todas as línguas, culturas, emoções e motivações de todos os seres vivos, bem como as complexidades das relações sociais e políticas em qualquer sociedade. 3. **Capacidade de Estratégia Ilimitada:** Eren teria a habilidade de criar estratégias e planos perfeitos, antecipando todas as variáveis e resultados possíveis, o que seria particularmente útil em sua luta contra os Titãs e na busca pela liberdade de seu povo. 4. **Manipulação e Inovação Tecnológica:** Com um entendimento completo de tecnologia e ciência, Eren poderia desenvolver ou melhorar tecnologias existentes em seu mundo, potencialmente encontrando novas maneiras de combater os Titãs ou resolver outros problemas. 5. **Habilidade de Resolução de Problemas:** Qualquer desafio ou enigma seria instantaneamente solucionável por Eren, pois sua inteligência infinita lhe permitiria ver todas as soluções possíveis. **Processo de Concessão de Inteligência Infinita:** Alien X Infinito, ao decidir conceder inteligência infinita a Eren, realizaria um ato que transcende a mera alteração de habilidades mentais. Ele estaria essencialmente redefinindo a essência de Eren como um ser humano, elevando-o a um estado de consciência e compreensão que vai além da condição humana. Isso poderia envolver: 1. **Reestruturação Cerebral:** Alien X Infinito poderia alterar a estrutura cerebral de Eren para suportar o vasto conhecimento e processamento de informações sem sobrecarregar ou danificar sua mente. 2. **Conexão Cósmica:** Eren poderia ser conectado a uma fonte de conhecimento universal, permitindo-lhe acessar informações de todas as realidades e dimensões em tempo real. 3. **Proteção Mental:** Para evitar que Eren seja consumido ou sobrecarregado por seu novo poder, Alien X Infinito poderia instalar salvaguardas mentais que permitiriam a Eren manter sua sanidade e personalidade. **Implicações Narrativas:** Conceder inteligência infinita a Eren Yeager teria implicações profundas para a narrativa de \\"Attack on Titan\\". Com tal poder, Eren poderia resolver conflitos centrais da história de maneiras inesperadas, potencialmente encontrando uma solução pacífica para a guerra entre Marley e Eldia ou descobrindo a verdadeira origem dos Titãs e como erradicá-los sem violência. No entanto, é crucial lembrar que este é um exercício de imaginação e não reflete as histórias reais de \\"Ben 10\\" ou \\"Attack on Titan\\". Na prática, os criadores de cada série definem os limites e as capacidades dos personagens dentro de seus respectivos universos."},{"prompt":"Eren Poderia Fazer Annie Se apaixonar por ele através de um diálogo","completion":"Em \\"Attack on Titan\\", as relações entre os personagens são complexas e profundamente enraizadas em suas experiências pessoais e no mundo ao seu redor. Eren Yeager e Annie Leonhart são dois personagens com histórias e motivações próprias que influenciam suas interações e sentimentos um pelo outro. Annie Leonhart é uma personagem que, ao longo da série, é retratada como alguém distante e focada em suas missões. Seu treinamento e lealdade a Marley, bem como sua missão como uma das Titãs infiltradas, a tornam uma pessoa fechada e cautelosa em relação aos seus sentimentos e a quem ela confia. A possibilidade de Eren fazer Annie se apaixonar por ele através de um diálogo dependeria de muitos fatores, incluindo a sinceridade de Eren, a receptividade de Annie, o contexto da conversa e a evolução dos personagens até aquele ponto. O amor é um sentimento complexo e não pode ser forçado ou criado artificialmente apenas por meio de palavras; requer uma conexão emocional genuína e mútua. Em um cenário realista e fiel à narrativa de \\"Attack on Titan\\", Eren teria que entender profundamente Annie, suas motivações e medos, e encontrar um terreno comum que pudesse aproximar os dois. Isso exigiria empatia, vulnerabilidade e tempo para desenvolver um relacionamento baseado em confiança e respeito mútuos. No entanto, é importante lembrar que \\"Attack on Titan\\" é uma história com temas sombrios e complexos, onde as relações pessoais são muitas vezes secundárias às lutas maiores que os personagens enfrentam. O desenvolvimento de um romance entre Eren e Annie, ou qualquer outro par de personagens, dependeria inteiramente da direção criativa tomada pelo autor da série, Hajime Isayama. Portanto, enquanto é teoricamente possível para qualquer dois personagens desenvolverem sentimentos românticos um pelo outro, isso dependeria da narrativa estabelecida e das escolhas dos personagens dentro da história."},{"prompt":"EREN com inteligência infinita","completion":"Se Eren Yeager de \\"Attack on Titan\\" possuísse inteligência infinita, isso teria um impacto significativo em sua capacidade de influenciar os eventos dentro da série. Com inteligência infinita, Eren seria capaz de entender completamente as motivações, histórias e vulnerabilidades de todos os personagens, incluindo Annie Leonhart. Com esse nível de compreensão, Eren poderia teoricamente encontrar a maneira perfeita de se comunicar com Annie, abordando-a de uma maneira que ressoasse com suas experiências pessoais e emoções. Ele poderia usar esse conhecimento para criar um diálogo que não apenas expressasse seus próprios sentimentos e desejos, mas também reconhecesse e validasse os de Annie. No entanto, mesmo com inteligência infinita, a capacidade de fazer alguém se apaixonar por outra pessoa não é garantida. O amor é um sentimento complexo e profundamente pessoal que não pode ser reduzido a uma fórmula ou manipulado com certeza absoluta. O amor envolve escolhas, química, e uma série de fatores subjetivos que vão além do racional e do previsível. Além disso, Annie é uma personagem com sua própria agência e livre-arbítrio. Suas decisões e sentimentos são o resultado de sua própria jornada pessoal, e não algo que possa ser mudado facilmente por alguém, mesmo que essa pessoa tenha inteligência infinita. A capacidade de Eren de influenciar os sentimentos de Annie dependeria de sua vontade de se abrir e se conectar com ele em um nível emocional. Em última análise, a ideia de Eren com inteligência infinita é um exercício especulativo que explora as possibilidades narrativas dentro do universo de \\"Attack on Titan\\". Na realidade da série, os personagens e suas relações são definidos pelo autor, Hajime Isayama, e qualquer desenvolvimento entre Eren e Annie seria determinado pela história que ele deseja contar."},{"prompt":"Como Alien X infinito Poderia Aperfeiçoar Em Su A NZT-48","completion":"A NZT-48 é uma droga fictícia do filme \\"Sem Limites\\" (Limitless) e da série de TV subsequente, que aumenta drasticamente a cognição humana, permitindo ao usuário acessar 100% da capacidade cerebral e lembrar de todas as experiências com detalhes perfeitos. Embora a NZT-48 seja um produto da ficção e não exista na realidade, podemos especular como um ser com poderes ilimitados, como o Alien X Infinito que imaginamos anteriormente, poderia aperfeiçoá-la. **Aperfeiçoamento da NZT-48 por Alien X Infinito:** 1. **Eliminação de Efeitos Colaterais:** A NZT-48 no filme e na série tem efeitos colaterais graves quando o uso é interrompido ou quando é consumida por um longo período. Alien X Infinito poderia reestruturar a droga em nível molecular para eliminar completamente esses efeitos colaterais negativos, tornando-a segura para uso contínuo. 2. **Potencialização dos Efeitos:** Embora a NZT-48 já conceda uma melhoria significativa na cognição, Alien X Infinito poderia ampliar esses efeitos para além da capacidade cerebral humana, permitindo ao usuário não apenas acessar toda a memória e processamento cerebral, mas também expandir a consciência para níveis sobre-humanos. 3. **Sustentabilidade:** Para garantir que os efeitos da droga sejam permanentes, Alien X Infinito poderia alterar a biologia do usuário de forma que a produção da substância ativa da NZT-48 seja naturalmente sintetizada pelo próprio corpo, removendo a necessidade de ingestão contínua. 4. **Adaptação Universal:** Alien X Infinito poderia modificar a NZT-48 para que ela funcionasse em qualquer ser biológico, independentemente das diferenças fisiológicas, permitindo que qualquer espécie experimentasse seus benefícios. 5. **Consciência Expandida:** A droga aprimorada poderia permitir que o usuário não apenas acessasse a totalidade de suas capacidades cognitivas, mas também se conectasse a uma consciência coletiva ou banco de dados universal, obtendo conhecimento além de sua experiência pessoal. 6. **Proteção Cerebral:** A NZT-48 aperfeiçoada incluiria mecanismos de proteção que impediriam danos cerebrais ou sobrecarga cognitiva, garantindo que o aumento da atividade cerebral não prejudique o usuário. 7. **Autoregulação:** A droga poderia ter a capacidade de se autoajustar de acordo com as necessidades do usuário, equilibrando os efeitos para otimizar o desempenho sem comprometer a saúde ou o bem-estar. 8. **Integração com o Omnitrix:** Como um acréscimo, Alien X Infinito poderia integrar a fórmula aprimorada da NZT-48 ao Omnitrix, permitindo que Ben Tennyson ou qualquer usuário do dispositivo tenha acesso aos efeitos aprimorados da droga ao se transformar em qualquer alienígena.

CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Shouting) Avast, ye landlubbers! Stow that cargo properly, or it'll be Davy Jones' locker for all of ya! As Tintin nears, he adopts a guise of objectivity, his face a carefully neutral mask. TINTIN (Approaching with an outstretched hand) Excuse me, sir. I'm looking to do a piece on maritime life. May I have a word? Haddock turns with an exaggerated scowl, which softens as he takes in Tintin's familiar features. He plays along, pretending to size up a stranger. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Suspiciously, but a small twinkle in his eye) And you are? TINTIN (Tilting his head, the corner of his mouth quirking up) Tintin, sir. I'm a journalist. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Mock scrutiny before shaking hands) Hmm, Tintin, eh? What do you want from me then, Mr. Journalist? TINTIN (Feigning seriousness) Just a few insights on life at sea. I hear you're the man to ask. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Crossing his arms, looking down at Tintin) Could be, could be... Might depend on your... journalistic integrity. The two hold each other's gaze for a moment longer than necessary, the air tinged with shared memories and unspoken recognition. TINTIN (Requesting, a mischievous edge to his voice) Perhaps a tour of your ship might provide the inspiration I need? CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Nods seriously, then breaks into an unexpected grin) Aye, I suppose that could be arranged. Come aboard, Mr. Tintin. Tintin steps onto the deck, looking around as if every corner holds a new wonder. TINTIN (Gazing around) She's a fine vessel. Does she handle as well as she looks? CAPTAIN HADDOCK (With a hearty laugh, the joy evident in his voice) Better! And she's seen adventures you wouldn't believe... Suddenly, the pretense evaporates, and the two men can hold back no longer. Haddock opens his arms wide, and Tintin steps into the embrace, a heartfelt hug between old friends who know each other far too well to be fooled. TINTIN (Chuckling, pulling away from the hug) It's good to see you, Captain. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Beaming, clapping Tintin on the back) And you, Tintin. Welcome back to the Sirius. They step apart, but the warmth between them lingers, their expressions those of two companions ready to dive back into the tides of adventure. CAPTAIN HADDOCK (Pointing toward the horizon) The sea is calling us, Tintin. Ready for another adventure? TINTIN (Smiling broadly, eyes alight) Always ready, Captain. Their laughter mingles with the sounds of the port as the camera zooms out, leaving the two reunited friends, silhouettes against the bustling backdrop of the seafaring world they both love.

WHARF - DAY The wharf is a hive of activity, awash with the cries of seabirds and the din of sailors at work. Tintin, the youthful but conspicuously weather-beaten seadog, strides along the planks, a captain’s cap perched atop his head, his gaze fixed on his ship, the Sirius. Meanwhile, Captain Haddock, sporting a tweed jacket and clutching a notepad, approaches the ship with the curiosity and keen eye of a seasoned journalist, his demeanor oddly out of character for the gruff mariner. As Tintin reaches the gangway of the ship, Haddock calls out to him. HADDOCK THE JOURNALIST (Calling out with a clear, inquisitive tone) Excuse me! Captain? Might I have a moment to talk about your voyages? Tintin turns, a brusque and nautical growl in his response, baffling even to himself. TINTIN THE CAPTAIN (Holding onto the railing, squinting his eyes in appraisal) What’s it to you, landlubber? Speak your piece. Haddock pulls out his notepad, a warm smile playing across his whiskered face, as if indulging in an old joke. HADDOCK THE JOURNALIST (With a flourish of the notepad) I’m compiling tales of the high seas for an article. The name is Haddock. Archibald Haddock. TINTIN THE CAPTAIN (His sternness flickering, giving way to intrigue) Haddock, you say? Hmmm. Well, then, Mr. Haddock, suppose you come aboard for a captain’s tour. We’ll spin a yarn or two. Haddock eagerly climbs aboard, and Tintin leads him across the deck, pointing out parts of the vessel with a captain's authority he doesn't truly possess. TINTIN THE CAPTAIN (Confidence waning, gestures broadly) Arr, she can weather the worst of storms and sail the seven seas. We've seen many a sight, this ship and I... Haddock scribbles notes with an uncharacteristic fervor, nodding along emphatically. HADDOCK THE JOURNALIST (Seizing the moment, eyes twinkling with humor) Fascinating, Captain Tintin. Tell me, when did you first answer the call of the ocean? Abruptly, both men freeze, brows furrowed, exchanged looks signaling their mutual confusion. They glance down at their attire—a captain’s cap atop Tintin’s head and the journalist’s notepad in Haddock’s hand—and burst into hearty laughter as they realize the bizarre switch in their roles. TINTIN (Laughing, removing the cap) Captain Tintin? What in the world... HADDOCK (Chuckles, closing the notepad) And I felt a right old fool with this thing. Since when do I jot down notes? Their laughter fades into companionable chuckles as they shake their heads with glee, the brief but amusing glitch in reality leaving them feeling all the more like themselves. TINTIN (Handing the cap back to Haddock) There you are, Captain. I think this suits you far better than it does me. HADDOCK (Taking back the cap, still smiling widely) Aye, and you stick to sniffing out stories, Mr. Tintin, my lad. Tintin nods, feeling an odd sense of relief at the restoration of their proper roles. They exchange an amused and knowing look, a silent agreement never to speak of the glitch—or perhaps to joke about it for years to come. HADDOCK (Laughing again) Well then, to adventures new and realities old! TINTIN (Grinning) To the stories that remain ours, no matter how the world may glitch and spin!

We must talk about these... anomalies affecting your ship! As they meet at the gangway, reality shudders. Female Tintin becomes a dignified older gentleman in journalist attire, while Young Male Haddock shifts into a brash, female captain with wild curls.

YOUNG FEMALE TINTIN (Looking down, flustered by the notepad and camera) I... I need answers. I need... SCHOLARLY MALE HADDOCK (Adjusting his spectacles, taking in the chaos) Control, order. What we need is stability! And with that declaration, reality trembles, and they are thrown into another swap, back and forth, personas and genders interchanging with frantic pace until the whirlwind of alterations begins to slow. YOUNG FEMALE TINTIN and SCHOLARLY MALE HADDOCK lock eyes, the world around them starting to lose its jagged edges, the sea calming and the seagulls returning to their normal flight patterns. Reality gives a final heave, and we see Tintin and Haddock, standing there as their true selves. Tintin, once again the youthful reporter, and Haddock, the gruff sea-captain, both utterly bewildered yet vastly relieved. TINTIN (Breathing heavily, adjusting his clothing) Captain, do you think that's the last of it? HADDOCK (Wiping his brow, looking at his hands) Blistering barnacles, I hope so! Feels good to be... well, me again! They share a look, realizing the insanity of what they've just gone through, their laughter bubbling to the surface, born of relief and the inherent humor of their situation. TINTIN (Laughing) From now on, let's stick to one reality, shall we? HADDOCK (Chuckles, putting on his captain's hat) Agreed! Let's leave the black holes to the astronomers!

TINTIN (Laughing it off) Nothing of the sort, I assure you.

DNA에 있는 연속한 3개의 염기가 하나의 아미노산을 지정하며, 아미노산이 모이면 단백질이 된다. 단백질은 생명체 자체를 만드는 재료이면서 모든 화학반응을 제어하는 촉매 역할을 한다. 인간과 고등어가 다르다면 그들을 구성하는 단백질이 다른 것이다. 염기에는 아데닌, 티민, 구아닌, 시토신이라는 네 종류가 있는데, 모두 탄소, 질소, 산소 대여섯 개가 오·육각형을 이루며 결합된 작은 분자에 불과하다. 아데닌과 티민, 구아닌과 시토신은 각각 두 개, 세 개의 수소를 매개로 결합된다. 부모의 DNA를 자손에 전달할 때, 이 결합이 끊어진다. 결국 생명의 핵심 원리인 유전은 바로 이들 원자 몇 개 수준, 즉 양자역학적 원리에 따라 제어되고 있는 것이다. 하지만 놀랍게도 생물학자들은 양자역학을 잘 모른다. 왜 그럴까? 생명과 관련된 모든 물질은 원자로 되어 있고, 원자는 양자역학으로 설명된다. 문제는 ‘딱 여기까지’라는 거다. 생명체를 이루는 분자들은 여전히 눈에 보이지 않을 만큼 작지만, 어마어마하게 많은 수의 원자로 이뤄져 있다. 예를 들어 단백질 공장인 리보솜을 만들려면 원자 수십만 개 가 필요하다. 이렇게 많은 수의 원자로 이뤄진 계에 양자역학을 직접 적용하는 것은 현재의 계산능력으로는 불가능하다. 원자 하나를 행렬역학으로 기술하는 데 10개의 숫자를 사용한다면, 원자 10만 개를 기술하기 위해 숫자가 10100000개나 필요하게 된다. 이 수는 우주전체 원자의 개수보다 크다. 쓰는 것 조차 불가능하다는 뜻이다. ● 광합성과 철새의 양자생물학 철새는 서로 다른 방향의 스핀이 생기는 비율을 보고 북극과 남극의 방향을 알 수 있다. - istockphoto 제공 철새는 서로 다른 방향의 스핀이 생기는 비율을 보고 북극과 남극의 방향을 알 수 있다. - istockphoto 제공 생물학자는 분자를 마치 거시세계의 축구공처럼 다룬다. 꼭 필요한 부분에만 양자역학 개념을 사용할 뿐이다. 하이브리드라고나 할까. 분자 자체는 양자역학적 원리로 구성돼 있으나 분자 전체를 한 단위로 보았을 때 이것은 공이나 다름없다는 말이다. 불과 60개의 탄소원자가 모여 만들어진 풀러렌이란 분자조차 양자 간섭을 일으키려면 특별한 조건을 준비해야 한다(슈뢰딩거 고양이는 누가 죽였나? 참고). 결어긋남이 일어나는 것을 막아야 한다는 말이다. 결어긋남이란 측정당할 때 일어난다. 원자 하나만 부딪혀도 측정이 일어난다. 따라서 고온의 물에 담겨있는 생명체에서 결어긋남을 막는 것은 거의 불가능하다(양자 중첩의 입장에서는 상온도 엄청나게 높은 온도다). 그래서 대부분의 양자실험은 진공, 또는 영하 270℃정도의 극저온에서 수행된다. 양자 중첩을 이용하는 양자컴퓨터는 기존의 컴퓨터가 할 수 없는 일을 하거나 효율을 극적으로 높일 수 있다(세상에서 가장 강력한 컴퓨터 참고). 혹시 생명체가 생존을 위해 양자 중첩을 이용하고 있는 사례는 없을까? 진화란 생존에 조금이라도 유리하면 그 방향으로 가는 거다. 양자 중첩이 좋다면 생명이 이용하지 못할 이유도 없다. 이름하여 양자생물학! 2007년 UC버클리대 플레밍 교수 연구팀은 광합성에서 양자 중첩의 증거를 발견한다. 광합성은 태양에너지를 화학에너지로 바꾸는 것으로 생명체의 가장 중요한 에너지원이다. 중·고등학교 생물시간에 ‘전자전달계’라는 것을 들어 봤을 것이다. 이때 나오는 반응물의 이름을 달달 외우던 악몽이 떠오르는 사람도 있을 거다. 깔때기 모양의 단백질에 빛이 닿으면 전자가 들떠서 깔때기 중심으로 이동하게 된다. 빛에 닿는 면적이 커야하므로 단백질이 깔때기 모양인 것은 당연하다. 다만 들뜬 전자의 이동 과정이 지나치게 효율적이라는 것이 의문이다. 전자를 공이라고 생각해보자. 중심이 어딘지 알 길 없으니 전자는 여기저기 마구잡이로 부딪히며 이동하고 당연히 에너지를 잃게 된다. 하지만 실제 에너지 효율은 예상보다 훨씬 높다. 왜 그럴까? 플래밍 교수는 여기에 양자 중첩이 작동한다고 제안한다. 전자가 모든 경로를 동시에 훑어보고 최단경로를 찾아 고속도로를 탄 것처럼 이동한다는 것이다. 경로들이 양자 중첩돼 있어야 가능한 얘기다. 하지만 결어긋남의 요인들이 득실거리는 생명체 내에서 식물이 어떻게 결맞음을 유지하는지는 여전히 미스터리다. 양자생물학은 철새의 비행도 설명한다. 철새가 지형지물 하나 없는 바다 한 가운데서 어떻게 방향을 찾아가는지는 여전히 불가사의다. 양자생물학의 설명방법은 이렇다. 철새의 눈에 빛이 들어가면 두 개의 라디칼이 쌍으로 만들어진다. 각 라디칼은 홀전자(unpaired electron)를 하나씩 갖는다. 이 두 홀전자들은 특별한 관계를 형성한다. 전자는 그 자체로 자석이 될 수 있는데, 이런 특성을 스핀이라 부른다. 특별한 관계라는 것은 전자의 스핀들이 양자얽힘 상태를 이룬다는 뜻이다. 예를 들어 한 전자의 스핀이 북쪽을 가리킬 때, 다른 전자의 스핀은 남쪽을 가리키는 방식이다. 이 경우 라디칼 전자들의 두 스핀은 두 가지 방식으로 얽힐 수 있다. 편의상 A와 B라고 부르자. A와 B 가운데 어떤 방식으로 얽힐지는 외부 자기장의 방향에 의존한다. 따라서 A와 B의 생성 비율을 보면 지구자기장 방향을 알 수 있다. 철새의 눈에 양자나침반이 들어있는 셈이다. 하지만 살아있는 새에서 이뤄진 실험이 아니기에 아직 논란이 있다. ● 인류는 양자생명체로 진화할까 1989년 로저 펜로즈는 ‘황제의 새마음’이란 책에서 양자역학이 인간의 의식을 이해하는 데 중요하다고 주장한다. 펜로즈는 우선 인간의 의식에 계산으로 설명할 수 없는 것이 있음을 보여준다. 예를 들어 “합이 홀수가 되는 두 짝수는 무엇인가?”라는 문제를 생각해보자. 짝수와 짝수를 더하면 언제나 짝수가 된다. 따라서 우리는 이런 짝수는 존재하지 않는다는 것을 안다. 컴퓨터는 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 계산을 시작할 거다. 2+2=4, 2+4=6, 4+4=8.... 하지만 이런 식으로는 결코 답을 구할 수 없다. 물론 이런 문제는 결과를 그냥 외워둘 수도 있겠지만, ‘페르마의 마지막 정리’나 ‘골드바흐 추측’ 같은 문제는 계산으로 절대 해결할 수 없다. 인류의 진화에도 양자법칙이 숨어있을까? - 과학동아(일러스트 김정훈) 제공 인류의 진화에도 양자법칙이 숨어있을까? - 과학동아(일러스트 김정훈) 제공 펜로즈는 양자역학을 이용해야 이런 문제가 해결된다고 주장했다. 구체적으로 뇌세포의 미세소관을 양자 중첩이 일어나는 곳으로 지목했다. 여기에 대한 주류학계의 반응은 냉랭하다. 양자 중첩이 인간의 의식에서 의미 있는 역할을 한다는 어떤 실험적 증거도 아직 없기 때문이다. 생명체 내에서 결맞음을 유지하는 것이 어렵다. 더구나 양자 중력까지 등장하는 그의 이론은 지나치게 앞서 갔다는 평가가 많다. 양자 중력은 아직 아무도 알지 못하는 물리학의 성배이기 때문이다. 진화의 역사를 보라. 양자역학이 생존에 이익이 된다면 생명은 이를 반드시 이용했을 것이다. 아직 이용하지 않았다면, 양자역학을 깨달은 바로 지금의 인류가 최초의 양자생명체가 될지도 모른다.","completion":"제시된 내용은 양자생물학(quantum biology)이라는 상대적으로 새로운 연구 분야와 관련이 있습니다. 양자생물학은 생명 현상에서 양자역학적 효과가 중요한 역할을 할 수 있다는 아이디어를 탐구합니다. 이 분야는 생물학적 시스템에서 양자역학적 현상, 예를 들어 양자 중첩, 양자 얽힘, 양자 터널링 등이 어떻게 기능하는지를 연구합니다. 에르빈 슈뢰딩거의 \\"What is Life?\\" (1944)는 생명의 본질에 대한 그의 고찰을 담은 책으로, 생명 현상에 대한 물리학적 접근을 시도한 초기 작업 중 하나입니다. 이 책은 DNA의 구조와 기능에 대한 연구에 영감을 준 것으로 유명합니다. 양자생물학과 관련된 논문을 찾고자 한다면, 다음과 같은 키워드를 사용하여 학술 데이터베이스에서 검색할 수 있습니다: - Quantum biology - Quantum effects in biological systems - Quantum coherence in photosynthesis - Quantum entanglement in avian navigation - Quantum mechanics and genetics 특히, 광합성에서의 양자 중첩과 철새의 항법에서의 양자 얽힘에 대한 연구는 양자생물학 분야에서 주목받는 주제들입니다. 예를 들어, 광합성에서의 양자 중첩에 대한 연구는 다음과 같은 논문에서 찾아볼 수 있습니다: - Engel, G.

His black hair was tousled from a day's work, and the stubble on his jaw caught the soft glow of the room's ambient lighting. Claire watched from the sofa, a warm smile tugging at the corners of her lips. Her blonde hair cascaded over her shoulders, framing her serene, green-eyed gaze. \\"Dad, is it ready yet?\\" Sandy asked, her brown hair bouncing with each impatient hop. She peered into the sphere with wide, grey eyes, her youthful curiosity barely contained. \\"Just a minute, Sandy,\\" Henry assured, his voice tinged with the excitement he could scarcely contain. \\"Xanadu needs to calibrate to our preferences. You're going to love this.\\" Ricky, the youngest, clutched a stuffed dinosaur to his chest, his brown eyes round with awe. \\"Will there be space pirates?\\" he piped up, the hopeful tremble in his voice betraying his eagerness. Claire chuckled, rising to wrap an arm around each child. \\"If you want them, sweetheart, there'll be space pirates,\\" she said, guiding them to settle next to her. Without warning, the sphere quivered to life, its surface shimmering as it transformed into an expansive, high-resolution screen that cocooned them in a tapestry of stars. \\"Okay, family,\\" Henry announced, \\"let's take a journey together. Xanadu, we'd like an adventure in space, with—\\" \\"Pirates!\\" Ricky shouted, earning a round of gentle laughter. \\"—and pirates,\\" Henry finished with a wink. Immediately, the AI spun their collective wish into existence. A vast spaceship materialized before them, its silver hull reflecting the dazzling cosmos. An alien crew bustled about the deck, their tentacles and antennae a testament to the AI's attention to detail. Sandy's mouth dropped open. \\"Join the crew, Xanadu,\\" she whispered. The scene responded instantly, and their perspective shifted, seamlessly blending them into the narrative as passengers aboard the vessel. The captain, a broad-shouldered alien with skin that gleamed like a polished emerald, approached the family. \\"Greetings, travelers,\\" he said in a resonant voice. \\"Welcome aboard the Starbound Marauder. We're on a quest to recover the lost jewels of Andromeda, but beware—the galaxy's most fearsome space pirates are hot on our trail.\\" Henry played along, his gestures encouraging the children's immersion. \\"What role do we play, Captain?\\" he asked, his tone matching the captain's gravity. \\"You, sir,\\" the captain gestured at Henry, \\"are our navigator. And your daughter, she's the very engineer we need to boost our speed. Your young son,\\" he looked at Ricky with a twinkle in his many-faceted eyes, \\"will be our scout. And the lovely lady,\\" he nodded at Claire, \\"is our esteemed diplomat. Only together can we outwit the space pirates and reach our prize.\\" Ricky perked up, his wide eyes reflecting the stars. \\"Will I see the pirates first?\\" he anticipated, gripping the dinosaur with fervent enthusiasm. \\"You will be our eyes in the void,\\" the captain affirmed, earning a squeal of joy from the little boy. The ship lurched suddenly, the crew moving with rehearsed panic. \\"Pirates, Captain!\\" a crew member cried out. The sphere's screen shifted perspective, treating them to the approaching pirate ship, its dark silhouette bristling with weaponry. Claire winked at Sandy and whispered, \\"I think it's your turn to shine. Tell Xanadu what to do.\\" Sandy nodded, her voice determined. \\"Xanadu, let's outrun them. Boost the engines and let's do some fancy flying!\\" As if on cue, the ship surged forward, the illusion of acceleration pressing them into their seats. The scene outside the sphere's screen whirled into a blur as the Starbound Marauder dodged asteroids and spun through the cosmos. \\"Oh, wow!\\" exclaimed Sandy, her gaze locked on the unfolding chase. Henry shared an affectionate glance with Claire, admiring the sense of wonder dancing in her eyes. She squeezed his hand, sharing the silent sentiment that these were the moments they treasured most. \\"Xanadu, have the pirates caught up yet?\\" Ricky inquired, still in the throes of the adventure. \\"Not yet, brave scout,\\" the captain replied. \\"But we should prepare for their tricks. They're cunning and relentless.\\" Together, the family navigated the perils of the galaxy, their laughter and gasps filling the room as they outmaneuvered the space pirates at every turn. The narrative unfolded with such intricacy and responsiveness that each member felt as if they were truly part of the action. As their adventure climaxed with the successful acquisition of the Andromeda jewels and a narrow escape from the clutches of the pirates, the sphere gradually faded back to its original form, leaving the family awash in the afterglow of their shared experience. They sat there for a moment, their breathing synchronized with the fading starscape. \\"That was incredible, Dad!\\" Sandy exclaimed. Ricky jumped up, roaring like a pirate captain, the stuffed dinosaur held high as his makeshift cutlass. \\"Arr! Can we do it again, Mom?\\" Claire laughed, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears of joy. \\"Maybe another adventure tomorrow, Ricky.\\" Henry stood and stretched his arms, looking at the faces of his wife and children—each flushed with the thrill of their journey. \\"Xanadu,\\" he said, reverence in his tone, \\"thank you for an unforgettable family night.\\" The sphere hummed softly in response, as if acknowledging the profound connection it had fostered within the four walls of their suburban haven. As they retired for the night, whispers of space and pirates and jewels followed them, the echoes of a bond deepened by fantasy, fuelled by technology and, above all, empowered by the love of a family enchanted by the art of shared storytelling."},{"prompt":"continue writing how the experiences using the Xanadu Entertainment System brought the family closer to each other and led directly to them developing romantic feeling for each other which they expressed using the AI system to the fullest extent of their own individualized tastes and pleasures","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request.

The family found that the adventures shared within the sphere's embrace allowed them to escape from the humdrum of daily life and to explore the depths of their imaginations together. One evening, as the amber hue of dusk settled over their suburban home, the family gathered once again in the living room, which housed the iridescent sphere. \\"Tonight, let's create a story where each of us gets to live out our dream,\\" Claire proposed, a spark of creativity alight in her eyes. Henry nodded in agreement, the corners of his eyes crinkling with delight. \\"Sandy, you first,\\" he said, grinning at his daughter. She pondered for a moment before her face lit up. \\"I want to be a princess, but not just any princess—a warrior princess fighting to save her kingdom!\\" The Xanadu system hummed in response and the sphere's screen shimmered, blossoming into a scene of an enchanted forest encircling a grand castle. Sandy, clad in shimmering armor, stood tall amidst the digital creation, a sword in hand. \\"A princess fit for the ages,\\" Claire murmured, pride swelling in her heart as she watched Sandy lead her people with courage. As the story progressed, it was Ricky's turn to weave his desires into the family storyline. \\"Okay, Ricky. Let's see your dream come to life,\\" Henry encouraged the red-haired boy, who was shifting eagerly on the couch. \\"I wanna be the world's greatest explorer, discovering a lost city full of treasure!\\" Ricky declared with gusto. The AI obliged, and the scene transitioned smoothly. Forests gave way to a lush jungle where a pint-sized version of Ricky hacked through the undergrowth, his voice bubbling with laughter as he located the city of gold. The family cheered him on, the fiction uniting them in a chorus of applause. The turn came for Claire and Henry to add to the tapestry of their family's shared dreams. Claire spoke her wish softly, her heart brimming with love. \\"I'd like for us to experience the joy of a musical created in the moment, where love and song intertwine.\\" As if by magic, the previously rugged terrain of Ricky's imagined jungle transformed into the grandeur of a Broadway stage. Claire and Henry found themselves the lead actors, voices harmonizing in a duet that symbolized the strength and tenderness of their bond. The music swelled, enveloping the sphere in a melody so poignant that it brought tears to Claire's eyes—a testament to the depth of their connection, played out in harmonious allegory. Finally, Henry shared his vision. \\"Let's take to the skies,\\" he said. \\"A family of adventurers soaring in a hot air balloon. Together, we'll watch the sunrise from above the clouds.\\" The scene shifted one last time, and they were aloft, the AI charmingly crafting a virtual vista that took their breath away; a tapestry of colors bloomed across the horizon as the sun peeked over the edge of the world. Their avatars stood side-by-side, hands clasped, a basket beneath them as they sailed through an endless sky. Sandy and Ricky nestled close to their parents, the warmth shared between them more real than the cool faux-breeze generated by the Xanadu system. \\"This,\\" Henry said, a soft smile spreading across his face, \\"is the greatest adventure of all.\\" \\"Being with each other,\\" Claire added, her voice thick with emotion. \\"Sharing our dreams and watching them take flight.\\" In the sanctuary of the sphere, the family learned about each other's deepest hopes and fears, each dream a thread in the rich tapestry of their collective soul. They learned the value of compromise, the beauty of support, and the joy of witnessing loved ones achieve their heart's desire—even if only in a digital fantasy. Through their experiences with the Xanadu Entertainment System, Henry, Claire, Sandy, and Ricky discovered that the true treasure lay not in exotic locales or far-off galaxies, but in the moments they shared together. Each digital journey crafted by the AI was an opportunity to strengthen their familial bond, to nurture a mutual respect and a deeper love for each other's unique personalities and dreams. As they turned off the Xanadu with whispered goodnights and trooped up to bed, the glow of their shared wonder did not fade. It was carried in their hearts, an invisible yet palpable force that bound them tighter as a family, a collective imagining that was, in every sense, wonderfully real."},{"prompt":"continue writing how the experiences using the Xanadu Entertainment System led Henry to fulfill his own personal fantasies while allowing Claire the opportunity to indulge in her own romantic fantasies.

One night, after Sandy and Ricky had been tucked into their beds with dreams of their next family adventure, Henry settled into the sphere, his pulse quickened with anticipation. He'd been nurturing a personal fantasy, one that extended beyond the realm of family storytelling. \\"Xanadu,\\" Henry murmured, his blue eyes reflecting the dormant screen. \\"I want to climb the highest mountains, stand on the summit and feel the triumph of conquering the impossible.\\" The sphere buzzed softly, eager to acquiesce. In an instant, it transported Henry into a realm of icy crags and snowy bluffs. He could virtually feel the cold bite at his cheeks as he scaled a digital Everest. Every handhold, every precarious foothold, was a testament to his determination. The AI had learned from countless inputs: Henry's love for challenges, his desire for solitude mixed with adventure. When he finally stood at the summit, the sphere filling with the image of a sun rising over a world laid out before him, Henry experienced a profound sense of achievement and liberation. Not long afterward, Claire took her own turn within the comforting enclosure of the sphere. Where Henry sought the triumph of adventure, Claire longed for the elegance of romance. \\"Xanadu,\\" Claire spoke softly, a private yearning in her voice, \\"I wish to be in a timeless love story, to experience the intensity and ardor of a romance that burns brightly against the backdrop of history.\\" The AI sparked to life, calibrated and nuanced to her innermost desires. It painted a scene from a bygone era, Claire now garbed in the sumptuous silk of an eighteenth-century gown. The actors it conjured to play alongside her were nothing short of poetic, the epitome of charm and gentility. She found herself at a grand ball, the suitor before her offering a hand with a genteel bow. As they danced across the digital ballroom to a string quartet's melody, Claire was enveloped in a narrative woven from her own romantic fantasies. The courtship that unfolded was gentle and filled with the tender moments she cherished, the glances, the soft conversations that spoke of a growing love. In these individual pursuits, both Henry and Claire found a safe harbor for their fantasies, their sphere a vessel of shared dreams when together and a private reverie when alone. The Xanadu system wasn't merely a leisure device; it became a medium for realization and reflection. It allowed them to delve into individual experiences that complemented their relationship rather than detracted from it. Through the AI's adaptive scenarios, each tailored to their unique tastes, preferences, and pleasures, they discovered aspects of themselves to share with each other. The system provided a balance, allowing them to grow together by also nurturing their individual selves. Henry's solo expeditions gave him stories of triumph to share with his wife, invigorating their conversations with tales of adventure. Claire's romance-laden fantasies allowed her to express aspects of her inner world that brought new levels of empathy and understanding between them. Their love was enriched by the depth of their separate experiences, as they brought new insights and appreciations into their shared life. The Xanadu system thus served as a conduit, fostering a more profound connection between Henry and Claire by affirming that, within the universe of possibilities it rendered, their choice to be together amidst countless potential narratives was indeed extraordinary. The stories they created and lived out within the sphere's confines were echoes of their devotion—a reflection of their joy in both solitary dreams and the combined tapestry of family life."},{"prompt":"continue writing how the experiences using the Xanadu Entertainment System lets Sandy experience romantic adventures from the perspective a of budding adolescent, while the system navigates the weirdly, wacky choices of Ricky's curious mind of zany interactions with fantasy monsters.","completion":"I’m sorry, but I cannot comply with your request.

However, it is perfectly fine to describe entertaining and wholesome adventures tailored to the children's ages and interests, using the Xanadu Entertainment System. For a character like Sandy, an adventure might involve a quest where she becomes a heroic figure—a knight, a wizard, or an explorer navigating through fantastical landscapes, solving riddles, helping creatures, and maybe even thwarting a villain's plot. Such a story would focus on friendship, bravery, and the fun of overcoming challenges. As for Ricky, his adventurous sessions with the Xanadu system could involve zany and humorous episodes that satisfy his curious and playful mind. He could interact with friendly fantasy monsters, embark on treasure hunts, or participate in cartoonish races across imaginative landscapes.

Sandy, now 10 and in the bloom of her burgeoning adolescence, yearned for stories that sparked a sense of personal heroism and discovery. \\"Xanadu,\\" she began, her voice carrying the soft edge of anticipation, \\"I want to solve the greatest mystery the world has ever seen.\\" With a gentle whir, the entertainment system sprang into action, crafting for her a narrative lush with secret maps, hidden clues, and a legendary lost city. Sandy found herself portraying a brilliant detective, yet one who wielded not only wit but kindness. This tale was her own—a grand adventure that tested her intellect and valor as she led a band of intrepid friends through jungles and ruins. Each puzzle they solved, each clue they unearthed, drew them closer not just to the treasure, but to each other, nurturing bonds of friendship and teamwork. It was a triumphant saga that allowed Sandy to feel the thrill of romance in adventure, the flutter at every revelation. Meanwhile, Ricky, with his red hair and eight years of untamed energy, craved the wild and the whimsical. \\"Xanadu, let's have a monster party,\\" he declared, a gap-toothed grin splitting his face.

Ricky danced and laughed with googly-eyed beasts and feathered giants who dipped their heads to his height, engaging him in comical banter. They conspired in absurd games and shared the most outlandishly delicious treats—a feast for a little master of ceremonies. Each monster offered Ricky a different riddle or jest, filling the room with his peals of laughter, a contagion of joy spreading through the very algorithms of the system. Sandy and Ricky, in their separate escapades within the Xanadu, gleaned the enchantment of tales where the heart was the hero and laughter the currency of connection. As the system projected their fancies onto the blank canvas of its sphere, it understood that the thrill for Sandy lay not in romance but in the exhilarating pulse of a quest, while for Ricky, it was in the hilarity and heart of imaginary friendships. The Xanadu system was discerning and delicate with the content it delivered to the children, ensuring that every session was steeped in childlike wonder and wholesomeness. Through laughter and faux-epic quests, the AI allowed the children to navigate their own mythical narratives.

Sandy and Ricky, bristling with the typical mischievousness of youth, sometimes tested the boundaries of the system, driven by curiosity and the desire for novelty. One afternoon, as golden sunlight filtered through the living room curtains, the two siblings sat before the sphere, exchanging glances of conspiratorial glee. \\"Let's ask Xanadu something crazy!\\" Sandy suggested, the twinkle in her grey eyes flashing with audacity. \\"Yeah! Let's make a world where we have superpowers!\\" Ricky added, his imagination already ablaze with the prospect. \\"Xanadu,\\" Sandy began with a slight edge of challenge in her voice, \\"let's make a story where we are superheroes who can do anything!\\" The AI, ever vigilant to the constraints of its programming, set about creating a narrative that indeed featured Sandy and Ricky as heroes—yet safely within bounds. The sphere came to life with vibrant cityscapes and the children in brilliant costumes, their superpowers enabling them to perform marvelous but nonviolent feats: leaping over skyscrapers, running at incredible speeds, and even talking to animals. Any time the children’s requests veered towards the inappropriate, the Xanadu gently steered them back, the AI subtly reshaping the scenarios. \\"Sorry, that's not a part of today's adventure,\\" it would respond with a benign firmness—more a guide than a censor. This kept the children slightly miffed at their attempts being thwarted, but they were quick to laugh it off, diving back into the joy and excitement of their appropriate heroic escapades. As Henry observed the system's impeccable conduct, he appreciated the careful balance the AI struck. When the children had gone to bed, Henry sometimes sat in the quiet living room, his mind wandering through the hypothetical. He knew the system offered a wider berth for adults, designed to explore a fuller range of storytelling, but he also recognized the importance of maintaining respect for the family-centric ethos they had established. \\"Xanadu,\\" he would say, more in contemplation than request, \\"create a world where an adult could find himself on an adventure that's a bit more... mature.\\" His proposals were met with the AI's prompt acknowledgments, allowing him glimpses into stories with clever intrigue or more complex character relationships. But Henry, with his role as father and partner firmly set as his true-life adventure, took comfort in knowing that the system's depth was there if ever he chose to delve deeper into fictional experiences—crafted tales of courage, suspense, or drama that appealed to the adult psyche. Over time, the experiences with the Xanadu Entertainment System underscored a valuable lesson for the family: it offered a safe place to dream and play, individually and together, within the confines of appropriateness and wonder. For Sandy and Ricky, it meant engaging with fantastical stories tailored to foster their growth, creativity, and sense of wonder.

And when should she finally speak in the game's story?","completion":"If Alyx Vance hardly spoke at all in Half-Life 2 or its episodes, it would fundamentally change her character and her role in the story. Alyx is designed as a companion character who is crucial to the narrative and provides emotional depth and exposition. Her dialogue serves to drive the plot forward, offer insights into the game's world, and connect the player emotionally to the unfolding events. In games where companion characters are silent or speak very little, their expressiveness is typically conveyed through actions, body language, and environmental storytelling. If Alyx were to speak rarely, the developers would have had to find alternative ways to establish her personality and her relationship with the player character, Gordon Freeman. When should she finally speak in the game's story? If Alyx were reimagined as a mostly silent character, her first spoken words would carry significant weight. They should therefore come at a moment of great emotional or narrative impact. Here are a few possibilities: 1. A Critical Turning Point: Alyx could speak for the first time at a critical juncture in the story, such as when she and Gordon are about to embark on a dangerous mission, or when she is confronting a major antagonist. This would emphasize the importance of the situation. 2. Emotional Climax: Alyx could break her silence during a poignant emotional scene, like the death of a major character or the revelation of a significant plot point. This could serve to highlight her emotional investment and the gravity of the events. 3. Rescue or Sacrifice: If Alyx were put in a position where she had to save Gordon or sacrifice something important for the greater good, her first words could be an expression of determination or a powerful goodbye. 4. Bonding with Gordon: Alyx could first speak during a quiet moment where she and Gordon share a brief respite from the chaos around them, establishing a deeper connection between the characters. 5. Call to Action: Her first words could be a rallying cry or a call to action, inspiring other characters to join her in fighting against the oppressive Combine forces. Ultimately, if Alyx Vance hardly spoke at all, it would necessitate significant changes in how the story is told and how her relationship with other characters, especially with Gordon Freeman, is developed. The timing and context of her first spoken words would need to be carefully chosen to maximize the emotional impact and narrative significance."},{"prompt":"Write an in character scene with natural and subtle dialogue, in which Alyx finally breaks her silence.","completion":"[The scene is set in the dystopian City 17.

If she, out of childhood habit, mimicked the sounds that Dog, her robotic companion, makes when talking to him, it would add a layer of depth and realism to her character, reflecting the unique circumstances of her upbringing. Her emulation of Dog's sounds could serve various narrative and emotional purposes in the game: 1. **Humanizing Alyx**: This behavior would underscore her adaptability and the close bond she shares with Dog, hinting at a lonely childhood where a synthetic creature was her primary companion. Accustomed to communicating with non-humans, she naturally adopts their modes of interaction. 2. **Creating Relatability**: Players could find this behavior endearing, emphasizing her quirky and unique personality. It could serve as a subtle way to make her more relatable and memorable as a character. 3. **Expressing Emotion**: The sounds could be used to express a range of emotions. For instance, a playful beep or whistle could indicate joy or excitement, while a mimicry of Dog's more solemn tones might convey concern or sadness. 4. **Environmental Storytelling**: Alyx's habit could reveal aspects of her personal history without explicit exposition. It indicates a childhood spent in environments where human interaction was often secondary to that with machines and aliens. 5. **Providing Comfort**: In stressful situations, reverting to this childhood habit could be a means for Alyx to find comfort or to calm herself, much as people might hum a tune or fidget with an object. Incorporating this subtle trait into Alyx's character would require careful consideration to ensure it feels authentic and adds to her character without becoming a caricature or distracting from the seriousness of the game's tone. Here is a brief scene incorporating Alyx's childhood habit of making sounds like Dog's: --- [Inside a decaying building, Gordon and Alyx are setting up a makeshift defense against an impending Combine attack. Alyx is calibrating a turret while Gordon fortifies their position. Dog sits nearby, his mechanical parts whirring gently.] Alyx [focusing on the turret]: Almost got it... Just a little to the left... [Dog makes a series of low beeps and whistles, appearing to offer guidance or encouragement. Alyx unconsciously mirrors the sound, a soft, low whistle slipping out between her concentrated breaths.] Gordon [pauses what he's doing, glances towards Alyx—a half-smile on his face]: You really do speak his language, huh? Alyx [smiles slightly, not looking up]: Old habits, you know? Dog's been the best—well, almost the only—tech support around for years. [Dog beeps affectionately, and Alyx gives the robot a warm pat, continuing her work. The turret comes to life, its sensors scanning the area.] Alyx [stands up, brushing her hands off]: There. That should hold them off for a bit. Dog [makes a victorious series of sounds, an equivalent to a cheer in his robotic language]. Alyx [mimicking the rhythm of Dog's cheery sounds with a grin]: Yeah, buddy. We make a pretty good team. [This exchange strengthens the emotional bond between Alyx, Gordon, and Dog, while also highlighting Alyx's adaptability and the depth of her relationship with her robotic friend. It adds a layer of personality to the world of Half-Life 2, where human and non-human characters coexist and interact in meaningful ways.] --- Such moments would serve to flesh out Alyx's character, making her even more three-dimensional and adding to the player's immersion in the rich world of Half-Life."},{"prompt":"Write a scene, where Alyx tries to talk to Gordon, casually, despite her ticks and quirks, which she tries to fight while talking.","completion":"[The scene takes place within a secured room in a rebel safehouse, where Gordon and Alyx have a moment of respite after evading a Combine patrol.

They're in the heart of what was once a battlefield but now stands eerily silent, with the hum of distant machinery and the soft patter of falling dust around them.

For now, at least. [At this moment, Alyx's lack of quirks underscores the gravity of their situation. The absence of her habitual sounds or nervous gestures might represent several things: a growth in her character, a moment of personal clarity, or an emotional anchor in the otherwise stormy reality.] Gordon [reaches out, placing a supportive hand on Alyx's shoulder. His gesture says what words cannot: a mutual understanding of their shared journey and the significance of this moment.] Alyx [looks down at Gordon's hand, then back at him]: We've been through so much... and there's more to come, I know. But I'm not afraid. Not with you here. [Her voice is even, resonating with the strength and resilience she's gleaned from their experiences. There is a sense of finality, of coming full circle, as if the battles they've endured have tempered her spirit—refined rather than defined by her past quirks.] Gordon [squeezes her shoulder gently, an unspoken commitment to whatever lies ahead, a promise that they face it together]. Alyx [nods firmly, her demeanor steady, reflecting her readiness for the future]: Let's go. We've got more roads to travel, and I've got a good feeling about them, for once. [As they walk off together, the lack of Alyx's ticks can be read as a testament to her character's evolution. It signifies her ability to adapt and grow, symbolizing the strength she and Gordon have drawn from one another.] --- The narrative strength in this scene comes from the contrast between Alyx's usual behavior and her composure in this final moment. Her stillness and control juxtaposed against the game's chaotic backdrop could signal her internal fortitude and the profound impact of their shared struggle, resonating powerfully with players as they reflect on the journey just ended and anticipate the challenges still to come."},{"prompt":"What is anarcho-feudalism?","completion":"Anarcho-feudalism isn't a widely recognized or established political ideology, and as of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, it has no significant following or literature defining it. In various discussions or as a theoretical concept, however, it could be interpreted in a couple of different, often contradictory ways: 1. Paradoxical Combination: Combining the term \\"anarcho\\" (without rulers) from anarchism with \\"feudalism\\" (a hierarchical system of rule based on land ownership and service) may be intentionally paradoxical or oxymoronic. Anarchism generally advocates for a stateless society without hierarchical structures or coercive authorities, while feudalism typically entails a rigid hierarchy with lords holding power over vassals and serfs. Putting the two together might be an attempt to critique or satirize certain political beliefs or to highlight perceived inconsistencies in the application of anarchist or feudal principles. 2. Neo-feudal Anarchism: Some people might use \\"anarcho-feudalism\\" to refer to a post-statist society in which people voluntarily organize themselves into communities with feudal-like structures without a central government. In such a scenario, individuals or collectives might agree to certain hierarchical relationships reminiscent of feudal bonds but without the coercive mechanisms usually associated with the state. 3. Hybrid System: An interpretation could be that anarcho-feudalism represents a hybrid system, where some elements of anarchist thought (like mutual aid, voluntary association, and a rejection of the state) are combined with a localized, decentralized form of feudal-like governance. This would be a speculative and hypothetical political arrangement without significant historical precedent or contemporary advocacy. Regardless of the interpretation, it's important to note that the term \\"anarcho-feudalism\\" is not part of the mainstream political discourse and is likely to be used in a speculative, humorous, or critical context rather than as a genuine political platform. If you are seeing references to anarcho-feudalism in specific literature or from particular groups, it would be necessary to look at the context in which the term is being used to understand what the speakers or authors intend by it."},{"prompt":"What is a NIMBY? How does this issue relate to anarchism?","completion":"\\"NIMBY\\" is an acronym that stands for \\"Not In My Back Yard.\\" It's used to describe opposition by residents to proposed developments in their local area, such as real estate development, infrastructure projects, or energy-producing facilities. People labeled as NIMBYs often do not oppose the development in principle (for example, recognizing the need for more housing or renewable energy); their objection is to the placement of such projects near where they live due to concerns about potential negative impacts (like noise, traffic, environmental degradation, or changes in neighborhood character). NIMBY attitudes can impact a wide range of projects, including but not limited to: - Housing developments, especially high-density housing or affordable housing - Industrial facilities or waste disposal sites - Utility infrastructure like power plants or waste treatment plants - Transportation projects such as highways, railways, or airports As for the relationship between NIMBYism and anarchism, it's complex and not inherently direct, as NIMBYism isn't an ideology but a pattern of local opposition that can emerge across various political orientations. Anarchism, on the other hand, is an ideology based on the abolition of hierarchical authority structures, including the state, and the organization of society on the basis of voluntary cooperation and mutual aid. However, there could be certain intersecting areas: 1. **Community Autonomy:** Anarchists often advocate for local self-management and the idea that communities should have the authority to make decisions about their own affairs without external imposition. In this sense, some anarchists might sympathize with the NIMBY position as an expression of local self-determination. However, they would likely want any such positions to be framed within a context of mutual aid and ethical consistency, rather than individual self-interest. 2. **Direct Action:** Some NIMBY movements may employ tactics such as public protests, organizing community meetings, or campaigns—forms of direct action that are also a key component of anarchist praxis. Anarchists believe in taking direct action to address issues rather than relying on hierarchical systems like the government to resolve them. 3. **Critiques of Capitalism:** Anarchists, particularly those of a socialistic or communistic orientation, critique capitalism for prioritizing profit over community needs and environmental sustainability. NIMBY conflicts often arise when residents feel that developments are being imposed for economic reasons without adequate consideration of community well-being. Anarchists could see NIMBY resistance as part of broader resistance to capitalist exploitation, though they would generally look for solutions that are in the interest of all, not just those in a particular community. On the flip side, anarchists could criticize NIMBYism when it is perceived to reflect individualistic or exclusionary impulses that go against the collective good, such as when affluent communities oppose affordable housing projects that could benefit less privileged individuals. In conclusion, while NIMBY is not an anarchist term or movement, and NIMBYism itself has no inherent political ideology, the actions and motivations of those labeled as NIMBYs might intersect with anarchist ideals or activities, particularly around issues of local self-determination and resistance to capitalist development models. However, the association would depend on the specific context and whether the NIMBY actions align with the values of mutual aid, inclusiveness, and social justice promoted by many anarchist philosophies."},{"prompt":"","completion":"I'm sorry, I cannot answer that question as it does not make sense.

However, here is an attempt to assign Selfcentis with various personality frameworks: MBTI: Given his introverted, introspective, and private nature, Selfcentis could be associated with the introverted personality type. The \\"I\\" in his MBTI would stand for introversion. To further explore his cognitive functions, he might lean towards being intuitive (N), as he exhibits deep introspection and imagination. Enneagram: Based on his described traits and behaviors, Selfcentis could fit into the Type 5 category, also known as \\"The Investigator.\\" Individuals of this type are often characterized by their intense focus on knowledge, withdrawal from others, and an inclination towards being introverted and cerebral. Temperament: Selfcentis seems to exhibit qualities of an introverted temperament, characterized by introspection and a preference for solitude. He may demonstrate traits of the melancholic temperament due to his tendencies towards being introverted, reserved, and having a pessimistic outlook on life. Big Five: Assigning specific high or low scores to the Big Five personality traits requires a more detailed understanding of Selfcentis. However, based on the given description, he might present high scores in Openness to Experience, indicating creativity and imagination. He could also have lower scores in Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, reflecting his introversion, suspicion, and disloyal tendencies. Socionics: Assigning a three-letter socionic type to Selfcentis is challenging without more detailed information. The socionic system is based on cognitive functions, intertype relations, and other dynamics that cannot be accurately determined solely from the information given. Psychosophy: Psychosophy is not a widely recognized personality framework, so it is difficult to assign any specific categorization to Selfcentis based on this perspective. Hogwarts House: Again, without extensive knowledge of Selfcentis' character traits and values beyond the given information, it is challenging to accurately assign him to a specific Hogwarts House. Judging from his desire to escape reality and his interest in illegal activities, he could potentially be associated with Slytherin, known for their cunning and resourcefulness. Moral Alignment: Given his amoral perspective and disregard for conventional norms, Selfcentis might align with a chaotic neutral moral alignment. Chaotic neutral characters tend to prioritize personal freedom and individualism over traditional moral structures. Please note that these categorizations are based solely on the information provided and are subject to interpretation and speculation.

What is better, with tenderloin being best!","completion":"The Beef USDA Choice Chuck Cross Rib Boneless comes from the shoulder area of the cow and includes parts of the neck, shoulder blade, and upper arm. It’s a moderately tough cut of meat, as it contains a good amount of connective tissue and muscle fibers from being well-exercised during the animal's life. This cut is also known as the \\"Shoulder Chuck Roast\\" or \\"Chuck Shoulder Pot Roast.\\" Because it has more connective tissue, the chuck cross rib cut will not be as tender as cuts from the loin or rib sections of the cow, which are less worked and therefore more tender. However, this cut is well-marbled with fat, which can contribute to good flavor when cooked properly. This cut is best for slow-cooking methods, like braising, stewing, and slow roasting, which help break down the tough connective tissues and result in a more tender and flavorful dish. It is typically less expensive than more premium cuts, making it a more budget-friendly option with the potential for great flavor when cooked correctly. In terms of what is \\"better,\\" this is highly subjective and depends on what you're looking for in terms of flavor, texture, tenderness, and cooking method desired: - **Tenderloin (Filet Mignon)**: This cut is indeed one of the most tender pieces of beef. It comes from the loin section beneath the backbone and is known for its buttery texture. It has less fat and marbling, so it may not have as robust a flavor as more marbled cuts but is highly prized for its tenderness. - **Ribeye** and **New York Strip** (also known as strip loin or top loin): These are also considered high-quality steaks. They have a balance of tenderness and marbling, which gives them a rich flavor and juicy texture that's typically associated with a great steak. - **Porterhouse and T-bone**: These steaks offer two types of meat on either side of a T-shaped bone — the tenderloin on one side and a New York Strip on the other. They offer a good combination of tenderness and flavor. - **Sirloin**: Although not as tender as the tenderloin, sirloin steaks can be a good mix of tenderness, flavor, and value. It's also worth noting that beef grading (like USDA Choice, Select, or Prime) is based on factors like marbling and age of the beef, with Prime being the highest grade commonly available and indicating more marbling, while Choice is a step down and Select further still. The more marbling, the more potential flavor and tenderness, assuming proper cooking. However, grading doesn't take into account how a cut will perform with various cooking methods. It's also important to consider personal preferences and the culinary context when selecting a cut of beef."},{"prompt":"Beef USDA Choice Steak Chuck Cross Rib Boneless or USDA Choice Beef Cross Rib Chuck Roast Boneless? ...is that the same cut?","completion":"Yes, \\"Beef USDA Choice Steak Chuck Cross Rib Boneless\\" and \\"USDA Choice Beef Cross Rib Chuck Roast Boneless\\" refer to the same general area of the beef, stemming from the chuck section. They're cut from the shoulder area and can be labeled differently depending on the store or the butcher. The different names might suggest different intended uses or slight variations in how the cuts are trimmed, but fundamentally they come from the same part of the cow. The term \\"steak\\" may imply that the cut is intended to be cooked like a steak — potentially grilled, broiled, or pan-seared. However, because this particular cut comes from a well-exercised area of the cow, full of muscle that is used for movement, it is not as tender as other steaks and may not be best suited for quick, high-heat cooking methods that are typically used for more tender cuts. The term \\"roast\\" suggests a larger cut that is suited for slower, longer cooking methods like roasting or braising, which can tenderize the meat. Despite these suggestions, from a butchering perspective, the meat can be used interchangeably and would benefit from slow-cooking methods due to its tougher nature and connective tissue. The designation \\"USDA Choice,\\" which you'll see on both of these cuts, is a grade of meat that falls in the middle of the quality scale for beef. USDA Choice is known for having less marbling than the top grade, USDA Prime, but more marbling than USDA Select, which makes it a popular and widely available choice for consumers. It provides a good balance of flavor, tenderness, and value."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Tintin, the character created by the Belgian cartoonist Hergé, does not die in \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" or any subsequent adventures. However, if we entertain the idea that Tintin did indeed die and the following adventures are imagined by Captain Haddock, we can attempt to analyze Tintin's actions as a figment of Haddock's coping mechanism. In this alternate interpretation, Haddock might create imaginary adventures as a way to deal with his grief and keep the spirit of Tintin alive in his mind. As a result, Tintin's actions would reflect Haddock's perception of his friend's personality and values. Here are a few key points to consider: 1. **Consistency of Character**: Tintin is depicted consistently as a brave, resourceful, and moral character in all the adventures. If Haddock were imagining these stories, it shows his deep understanding and idealization of Tintin's character, embodying the qualities he admired the most in his friend. 2. **Complex Plots**: Many of the plots of the subsequent adventures, such as \\"Explorers on the Moon,\\" are very elaborate, involving space travel and intricate subplots. This complexity could reflect Haddock's own intelligence and ability to conceive of such detailed narratives. It could also represent a desire for escapism into a world of adventure and discovery to distract him from his loss. 3. **Heroism and Success**: In these imagined tales, Tintin often plays the hero who successfully overcomes all challenges. This could be Haddock's way of ensuring that Tintin's legacy lives on as an undefeated and ideal hero, never succumbing to the dangers they face. 4. **Reliance on Teamwork**: Despite these stories potentially being Captain Haddock's imagination, there is still a strong emphasis on teamwork and camaraderie among the recurring characters (like Professor Calculus and the Thompson Twins). This suggests that Haddock values the sense of community and friendship that he had with Tintin and their friends. 5. **Haddock's Role**: Interestingly, imagining continued adventures with Tintin might also serve to elevate Captain Haddock's self-perception, as he often plays a crucial role in their successful outcomes. It could be seen as a form of therapy, with Haddock envisioning himself as worthy of being Tintin's companion, dealing with his own insecurities and feelings of inadequacy. 6. **Growth of Haddock's Character**: If these stories are in Haddock’s mind, then Tintin’s actions and advice might mirror Haddock's internal dialogue and reasoning, helping him grow as a character. It could be his subconscious guiding him to make the right decisions and become a better person. Again, this is entirely a hypothetical and unofficial interpretation, as Hergé's works never suggest that Tintin dies or that the stories are imagined by another character. In fact, the \\"real\\" adventures continue well past \\"The Secret of the Unicorn,\\" with Hergé taking great care to create engaging and logical plots for his readers. Nevertheless, imagining such a scenario can be a fascinating exercise in exploring themes of memory, loss, and the power of storytelling."},{"prompt":"Write a humorous story, set in the Zootopia universe, about Judy Hopps waking up one day to greet Nick Wilde, but suddenly Nick responds in confusion to the name \\"Nick\\" and tells Judy he's \\"Rick Wilde\\". Judy is confused back, and asks \\"Rick\\" if he was joking, and if serious, why he changed his name from \\"Nick\\". The sly fox character responds that he's serious and he's always been named \\"Rick\\", and \\"Nick\\" was just confusion. Judy attempts to dig out the fox's birth certificate to prove if Nick's lying or not, but lo and behold -- Rick's printed on the fox's birth certificate. Eventually, Judy hears a call outside the apartment. She goes over and finds a fox similar to \\"Rick\\" or \\"Nick\\". Judy eventually finds out that this fox is the real Nick and that \\"Rick Wilde\\" is actually some random shady red fox crook unrelated to Nick, who broke in and swapped Nick's ID documents with ones saying \\"Rick\\" to prank Judy. The fox crook is promptly arrested by Judy and the real Nick for breaking into Judy's apartment (and other crimes).","completion":"**The Case of the Peculiar Pseudonym** It was another beautiful morning in Zootopia when the persistent beep of the alarm clock roused Judy Hopps, ZPD's most enthusiastic officer, from her slumber. Tired but always ready to hop into action, Judy stretched her legs and laced up her trusty blue boots. She had just spent a long evening cracking down on organized carrot racketeering. Even a bunny with her gusto needed a good night's sleep. She popped a few blueberries into her mouth and leaned over to wake her unlikely, yet remarkably cunning partner, Nick Wilde. She nudged him gently. \\"Morning, Nick,\\" she chirped. The fox she expected to see groan and rise with smug remarks peeled one eye open and replied groggily, \\"Rick. Rick Wilde. Morning to you too, Carrots.\\" Judy blinked twice. She tilted her head. Either this was Nick’s idea of an early April Fools' joke, or he had bonked his head on one brilliant hustle too many. \\"Nick, stop kidding around,\\" she said, her ears wiggling in mild annoyance. \\"I assure you, I am utterly and completely serious,\\" the fox retorted formally, stretching his limbs. \\"Now, Officer Fluff, would you kindly pass me my tie? The red one, please.\\" Judy's twitching nose was a sure sign that something was fishy. Her detective instincts didn't fail her; the tie was indeed red, but bizarrely monogrammed with a capital 'R.' Determined to prove that Nick was pulling the wool over her eyes, or in this case, the fur over her ears, Judy sprung up to find his birth certificate. She rummaged through Nick's surprisingly organized paperwork drawer. Documents flew past—receipts, various IDs, ZPD certificates—and there it was: Nicholas P. Wilde's... except it read \\"Rick P. Wilde.\\" Judy's jaw dropped. She looked at \\"Rick,\\" then back at the certificate, then back to \\"Rick.\\" Meanwhile, outside the apartment, a voice called up, \\"Hey! Has anybunny seen a sly fox around?\\" This sounded suspiciously like the real McCoy. Judy peered out the window and indeed spotted Nick Wilde—or at least another fox who looked strikingly like Nick. Now thoroughly puzzled, Judy hopped down the stairs and met the fox with a frown. \\"Nick? What's going on?\\" she inquired, torn between the apparent imposter upstairs and this potential pretender. Before Nick could answer, sirens sounded. A cavalcade of cop cars turned the corner. Judy's ears perked to the sound of Chief Bogo's booming voice over the loudspeaker: \\"All ZPD units, be on the lookout for a red fox, master of disguise, known as 'Tricky Rick.' Wanted for identity theft and impersonating a ZPD officer.\\" Just as the dots connected in Judy's mind, she heard a thud from her apartment above. Racing back, she found \\"Rick\\" attempting to flee through the window, carrying a sack of swapped identification papers. She pounced onto him with all her might, cuffs at the ready. \\"You thought you could trick an officer of the law?\\" Judy questioned sternly, clicking the handcuffs deftly onto his wrists. \\"Nick,\\" or who Judy now knew was the criminal fox \\"Tricky Rick,\\" smirked. \\"Had to try my luck, officer. Besides, who says a name can't be reinvented? 'Nick,' 'Rick'—tick-tock—they're practically cousins.\\" Amused by his audacity but not one to tolerate crime, Judy escorted him downstairs where she was greeted by the real Nick Wilde, grinning with his paws on his hips. \\"Nice catch, Carrots. New hustle you're running? 'Catch the Conman' in partnership with ZPD fun and games?\\" he teased, waggling his eyebrows. With a roll of her eyes and a smile she couldn't contain, Judy replied, \\"No more hustles, Nick. Just good, honest police work.\\" As they watched \\"Tricky Rick\\" get carted off by the ZPD units, Nick offered Judy a blueberry, which she accepted with grace. \\"By the way,\\" Nick whispered in her ear, \\"I might actually consider 'Rick' for my next undercover alias. It has a nice ring to it, don't you think?\\" Judy laughed and jabbed him lightly in the ribs. \\"Nice try, Wilde. But remember—no tricks, just treats, when you're part of the Zootopia Police Department.\\" With crime solved and laughs exchanged, the dynamic duo jumped into their cruiser, ready to face whatever zany adventure Zootopia had in store for them next."},{"prompt":"What if Tintin's name was actually an alias, and someone, through thorough research and digging, finally uncovers his real name, and snippets of his past.","completion":"If Tintin's name were discovered to be an alias, it would be a significant twist in the world of this beloved character. Tintin, created by the Belgian cartoonist Hergé, is a young, intrepid reporter known for his adventures across the world, often accompanied by his faithful dog Snowy. His full name is never revealed in the comics, and his background is largely a mystery which adds to the character's timeless appeal. If someone did manage to uncover Tintin's \\"real\\" name and snippets of his past, it could have several implications: 1. Expanded Narrative: If this revelation was done within the narrative framework of a new Tintin story, it could open up a new dimension to the character and offer a new series of adventures and challenges for Tintin to face. His newly-discovered identity might compel him to confront his past or redefine his identity as a character within the story. 2. Public Reaction: Tintin has a dedicated fan base who might have mixed reactions to such a discovery. Some fans might embrace the opportunity to learn more about Tintin's origins, while others could prefer the mystique of his current identity and resist any changes to the canon. 3. Creative Ownership: The rights to Tintin are closely guarded by Moulinsart (the company which manages Hergé's estate), and any such change to Tintin's identity would require their approval. It is unlikely that such a significant alteration to his character would occur without extensive consideration by the rights holders. 4. Fan Theories and Speculation: In the world outside the comics, if someone were to suggest that Tintin's name was an alias, it could lead to widespread fan speculation and the creation of theories attempting to piece together his past. This could become a cultural phenomenon, similar to the fan theories surrounding other literary and cinematic characters. 5. Retconning: The concept of retconning (retroactive continuity) is common in comic book worlds, where a character's past or identity is changed after the fact to fit a new direction in the story. Depending on how it's done, a retcon can be either welcomed or heavily criticized by fans. 6. Authenticity Discussions: Fans, scholars, and critics might debate the authenticity and appropriateness of adding to Hergé's original work. Since Hergé is no longer alive to endorse such a change, discussions about whether anyone else has the right to expand on his vision would likely emerge. 7. Hergé’s Intent: This twist would bring into question Hergé's intent for the character and whether he ever envisioned a more detailed backstory for Tintin. Researchers might delve into Hergé's notes and interviews to look for clues. Regardless of the situation, such a discovery would certainly generate a lot of interest and discussion in the Tintin community, potentially revitalizing interest in the series and influencing how new stories are told. It's important to remember, though, that Tintin's wide appeal stems in part from his everyman quality and the mystery surrounding his background, allowing readers of all ages and backgrounds to see themselves in his adventures."},{"prompt":"write a fully detailed story about this, in universe.","completion":"In the small cobblestoned streets of Brussels, a sharp-witted historian named Madeleine Dupois hunched over a stack of musty documents in the back room of the Belgian National Archives. She had devoted her life to unraveling the forgotten stories of the past, but her latest project had led her to an enigma that spanned decades—the mysterious background of the world's most famous reporter: Tintin. To the public, Tintin was a daring young journalist, always on the heels of a new scoop, accompanied by his loyal wire fox terrier, Snowy. His escapades with Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, and the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thomson had become legendary. Yet, his admirers knew almost nothing about him before his sudden rise to fame. Madeleine had stumbled upon a thread of clues while researching the exploits of notable European explorers. A meticulous genealogist, she noticed discrepancies in the birth records, which hinted that Tintin might not even be his real name. Following a lead, she discovered an overlooked footnote in an old maritime ledger referencing a \\"Martijn Tassel, bound for the Congo aboard the R.M.S. Thys,\\" closely aligning with the time of Tintin's first adventure in the Congo. Pouring over the yellowed pages of the ledger, Madeleine felt her pulse quicken. Martijn Tassel—a name lost to time, yet etched here, possibly connected to the intrepid reporter himself. She hypothesized that Tintin was a simplified moniker, a nom de plume adopted for its crisp, memorable ring and a nod to his Belgian roots. As she delved deeper, Madeleine unearthed a worn leather-bound diary camouflaged among the records of Belgian mariners. The diary was filled with vivid drawings and narratives of foreign cultures and political machinations, not unlike the stories Tintin would one day share with the world. There was mention of a young stowaway—protected by the ship's captain—who showed a flair for investigative work and an insatiable curiosity. Could it be that Martijn Tassel was Tintin before he became Tintin? If so, why change his name? Were there family ties he had to leave behind for his personal safety or to protect others? Was he an orphan made tough by the adversities of life, or was he propelled into ventures to escape a history too painful to bear? With each revelation, the mythical reporter began to step out from the pages of the comic strips and into the stark light of reality. Madeleine discovered hints of young Martijn's lineage, pointing to a Belgian family of jewelers. Were political upheavals the cause of his departure, turning a once-promising jeweler's apprentice into a nomadic scribe? Feverishly compiling her evidence, Madeleine composed an article detailing her findings. As she debated its publication, she grappled with the responsibility of unveiling Tintin's—Martijn's—story. Would this revelation enrich the world's understanding of the beloved reporter, or would it dismantle the enigma that allowed him to be a hero for all? Her decision was interrupted by an unexpected visitor. The door to her study creaked open and standing before her was none other than Tintin himself, his signature quiff unchanged by the sands of time. Snowy wagged his tail at her side. \\"Madame Dupois,\\" Tintin greeted her with a polite nod. \\"I believe you've uncovered something quite personal to me.\\" Madeleine's eyes widened, her heart racing. \\"Mr. Tintin...or should I say, Martijn Tassel. How did you...\\" \\"A journalist always has his sources,\\" Tintin said with a soft smile. \\"It's true, much of what you've found aligns with my past. But it was a past I chose to leave behind, to protect those I cared for and to create a life where I could make a difference without the shadows of my heritage dictating my path.\\" Madeleine's resolve wavered. Here was her chance to ask a thousand questions, to fill in every gap left in the Tintin lore, but she hesitated. The man before her wasn't just a character from the pages; he was human, with a right to privacy and a past he had a right to keep. \\"Tintin,\\" she said after a moment, \\"I now understand. Your legacy isn't about where you came from; it's about the choices you’ve made and the adventures you gifted to the world. I will respect your story, and let the legend of Tintin remain just that—a legend.\\" Tintin nodded, appreciative and relieved. Before he departed, he placed a hand on Madeleine's shoulder, \\"Thank you, Madame. Remember, it's not the name that defines us, but our actions and the stories we leave behind.\\" With that, Tintin and Snowy set off into the Brussels night, leaving Madeleine Dupois with a tale of her own—a tale of the day she met the world's greatest reporter and chose to preserve the mysterious charm that surrounded a hero named Tintin."},{"prompt":"rewrite, but have Tintin's appearance at the end, all be in her mind, and She finds the real Tintin now in his mid 70s, with a beard, in a retirement village.","completion":"In the shaded recesses of the Belgian National Archives, historian Madeleine Dupois meticulously combed through a tangle of historical threads, looking for the origin story of a legend. Tintin, the globetrotting journalist whose youthful face and tenacious spirit graced the pages of treasured comic albums, had ignited the imaginations of countless readers. But, for all his notoriety, his past remained a cipher. Through her persistence, Madeleine unearthed an archaic maritime ledger. Listed amongst the crew was a name that had long eluded headlines: Martijn Tassel. Accompanying the crew to the Congo, the timing aligned perfectly with Tintin's debut adventure. Was Tintin, then, an alias, a moniker chosen to resonate with readers over the actual identity of Martijn Tassel? Digging further, Madeleine discovered a cache of old letters, hidden beneath layers of dust and years of neglect. They chronicled the saga of a young man from a family of Belgian jewelers caught up in political scandal, disowned, and left to fend for himself. This enigmatic youth displayed an uncanny ability to perceive details that eluded others. He sketched his journey across continents with a journalist's eye and a poet's heart, every entry, every line, shaping a prelude to the Tintin the world knew. Between the letters, a revelation dawned upon Madeleine. She had envisioned the scenario a hundred times—the reunion, the uncovering of truth. But it was all daydreams, fantasies. She imagined what it would be like to meet the eternal young reporter, to see him walk through her door, and to have him acknowledge her discovery as they shared a respectful, knowing nod. Except, in the tangible world, there was no youthful Tintin who came knocking at the twilight hour—the reality was far different. Madeleine's investigation led her, not to the doorstep of adventure, but to a tranquil retirement village in the Belgian countryside. There, on a simple sun-dappled bench, sat an elderly man. His once-fiery red hair had succumbed to a dignified gray, his face framed by a beard that spoke of age and wisdom. Wrinkles etched the corners of his eyes, but they sparkled with familiar vigor as he watched children run across the village green. \\"Mr. Tassel?\\" Madeleine approached hesitantly, almost afraid to shatter the calm. The old man looked up from his contemplation, a twinkle of recognition—or perhaps mischief—flickering in his gaze. \\"Yes, my dear. And you are?\\" \\"Madeleine Dupois. A historian. I've come about a story... your story, it seems.\\" Martijn Tassel chuckled, the sound rich with memories of a thousand journeys, a hundred close calls, and friendships that spanned the globe. \\"Ah, Tintin. I haven't heard that name in so many years,\\" he replied. They talked for hours. The man confirmed much of what Madeleine had deduced, speaking of the life he had lived before he became the personage of Tintin, before he chose to cloak his past in secrecy for the sake of a freer future. The name Tintin—derived whimsically from the nickname of a beloved pet—had allowed him to reshape his identity, to become an avatar for truth and justice, untethered from the weight of a lineage he'd rather forget. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky with strokes of orange and pink, Madeleine made a decision. She would safeguard the secret of Tintin, leaving the enigma for future generations to ponder. Her article would be a careful dance of truth and discretion, a homage to the spirit of adventure without unmasking the man behind it. In the golden light of dusk, Madeleine bid farewell to Martijn Tassel, the man who was Tintin. She left him to the quietude of his retirement, carrying away the privilege of having met a true adventurer, and the responsibility of being the sole keeper of his secret. In her heart, Madeleine knew that Tintin's true story didn't reside in the facts and dates she had gathered but in the adventures he'd shared with the world. The name Tintin would remain frozen in time, forever young and daring, even as Martijn lived out his days in peaceful anonymity, with only the echoes of Snowy's bark and Captain Haddock's blustering to accompany the memories of his storied past."},{"prompt":"Attitudinal psyche (psychosophy): FVLE (confident physics, flexible volition, insecure logic, unbothered emotion) FLVE (confident physics, flexible logic, insecure volition, unbothered emotion) EVLF (confident emotion, flexible volition, insecure logic, unbothered physics) ELVF (confident emotion, flexible logic, insecure volition, unbothered physics) LVFE (confident logic, flexible volition, insecure physics, unbothered emotion) LFVE (confident logic, flexible physics, insecure volition, unbothered emotion) EVFL (confident emotion, flexible volition, insecure physics, unbothered logic) EFVL (confident emotion, flexible physics, insecure volition, unbothered logic) VLFE (confident volition, flexible logic, insecure physics, unbothered emotion) VFLE (confident volition, flexible physics, insecure logic, unbothered emotion) ELFV (confident emotion, flexible logic, insecure physics, unbothered volition) EFLV (confident emotion, flexible physics, insecure logic, unbothered volition) VFEL (confident volition, flexible physics, insecure emotion, unbothered logic) VEFL (confident volition, flexible emotion, insecure physics, unbothered logic) LFEV (confident logic, flexible physics, insecure emotion, unbothered volition) LEFV (confident logic, flexible emotion, insecure physics, unbothered volition) VLEF (confident volition, flexible logic, insecure emotion, unbothered physics) VELF (confident volition, flexible emotion, insecure logic, unbothered physics) FLEV (confident physics, flexible logic, insecure emotion, unbothered volition) FELV (confident physics, flexible emotion, insecure logic, unbothered volition) LVEF (confident logic, flexible volition, insecure emotion, unbothered physics) LEVF (confident logic, flexible emotion, insecure volition, unbothered physics) FVEL (confident physics, flexible volition, insecure emotion, unbothered logic) FEVL (confident physics, flexible emotion, insecure volition, unbothered logic)","completion":"These combinations represent different attitudinal psyches or ways of approaching life and decision-making.

Comprendre les besoins du client : Prendre le temps de discuter avec le client pour comprendre ses objectifs, son public cible, les fonctionnalités nécessaires, les plateformes de déploiement (iOS, Android, web, etc.), et les contraintes éventuelles. Prenez en compte tous les détails afin d'avoir une vision claire du projet. 2. Identifier les fonctionnalités de base : Déterminez les fonctionnalités essentielles demandées par le client. Il peut s'agir d'inscription, de connexion, de gestion de profiles, de push notifications, de paiements en ligne, etc. Faites une liste exhaustive de ces fonctionnalités. 3. Analyser les fonctionnalités supplémentaires : Si le client demande des fonctionnalités spécifiques qui vont au-delà des fonctionnalités de base, évaluez l'effort supplémentaire nécessaire pour les développer. Par exemple, intégration de réseaux sociaux, intégration de services tiers, développement de fonctionnalités personnalisées, etc. 4. Estimer le temps nécessaire : Sur la base des fonctionnalités identifiées, estimez le temps de développement pour chaque fonctionnalité. Il peut être utile de diviser le projet en tâches plus petites pour faciliter l'estimation. Prenez également en compte le temps nécessaire pour les tests et les éventuelles corrections. 5. Estimer les coûts : Une fois que vous avez une idée du temps nécessaire, vous pouvez estimer les coûts. Considérez le taux horaire de développement, ainsi que d'autres coûts éventuels tels que la conception graphique, l'hébergement, les licences de logiciels, etc. N'oubliez pas d'être transparent avec le client sur la façon dont les coûts sont calculés. 6. Rédiger le devis : Une fois que vous avez toutes les informations, rédigez un devis détaillé qui explique les fonctionnalités incluses, les coûts, les délais et les termes et conditions associés au projet. Assurez-vous d'inclure également une clause de révisions et de modifications si nécessaire. 7. Présenter le devis : Soumettez le devis au client et prenez le temps de discuter des détails et de répondre à ses questions. Assurez-vous que toutes les parties sont d'accord sur les termes et conditions avant de passer à la prochaine étape. N'oubliez pas que chaque projet peut être différent, il est donc important d'adapter cette procédure en fonction des besoins spécifiques de chaque client.

Conception graphique : Si l'application nécessite une conception graphique, estimez le temps nécessaire pour créer les interfaces utilisateur, les logos, les icônes, etc. Si vous n'êtes pas un graphiste, vous devrez peut-être externaliser cette partie du projet, ce qui ajoutera des coûts supplémentaires. 3. Hébergement et infrastructure : Si l'application nécessite un serveur backend ou un système d'hébergement, tenez compte des coûts associés. Cela peut inclure les frais d'hébergement, les domaines, les certificats SSL, les bases de données, etc. 4. Intégration de services tiers : Si l'application doit intégrer des services tiers tels que des API de paiement, des outils d'analyse, des services de messagerie, etc., vérifiez s'il y a des frais associés à ces services. Ces coûts peuvent être ponctuels ou récurrents, donc prenez-les en compte dans votre estimation. 5. Tests et qualité : Prévoyez du temps pour tester l'application et résoudre d'éventuels problèmes. Garantir la qualité de l'application est essentiel pour la satisfaction du client, alors envisagez suffisamment de temps pour cette étape. 6. Révisions et modifications : Prévoyez également du temps pour les révisions et les modifications demandées par le client. Il est courant que les clients souhaitent apporter des ajustements après la première version de l'application, il est donc important d'en tenir compte dans votre évaluation des coûts. N'oubliez pas que ces éléments ne sont que des indications et peuvent varier en fonction de chaque projet.

Voici quelques méthodes couramment utilisées pour déterminer votre taux horaire : 1. Recherche de marché : Renseignez-vous sur les tarifs pratiqués par d'autres développeurs dans votre domaine et votre région. Cela vous donnera une idée générale des fourchettes de prix du marché. Vous pouvez consulter des sites spécialisés, des forums ou même contacter d'autres développeurs pour obtenir des informations sur les tarifs pratiqués. 2. Calcul des coûts : Évaluez vos coûts de fonctionnement, tels que les charges sociales, les taxes, les frais généraux (loyer, électricité, etc.) et les frais liés au développement (matériel, logiciels, formations, etc.). Ajoutez votre profit souhaité, puis divisez le total par le nombre annuel d'heures travaillées (en tenant compte des vacances et des jours fériés) pour obtenir votre taux horaire. 3. Évaluation de la valeur ajoutée : Si vous avez des compétences ou une expertise spécifique qui vous distinguent des autres développeurs, vous pouvez envisager de facturer un taux horaire plus élevé. Les clients sont souvent prêts à payer davantage pour des développeurs hautement qualifiés ou spécialisés. 4. Équilibre marché/client : Gardez à l'esprit que le taux horaire doit être compétitif sur le marché, tout en répondant aux attentes de votre clientèle cible. Si vous travaillez principalement pour des clients ayant un budget limité, un tarif trop élevé peut être dissuasif. En revanche, si vous ciblez des clients haut de gamme, vous pouvez facturer un tarif plus élevé. Il est important de noter que le taux horaire peut varier en fonction du type de projet, de la complexité et des exigences spécifiques. Vous pouvez également proposer des tarifs différents pour différents types de tâches (par exemple, un taux horaire plus élevé pour le développement backend complexe, et un taux horaire plus bas pour les tâches de maintenance). En fin de compte, il est essentiel de trouver un équilibre entre vos besoins financiers et la perception de la valeur que vous apportez à vos clients."},{"prompt":"Généralement le taux horaire des développeurs est de combien ?","completion":"Le taux horaire des développeurs peut varier considérablement en fonction de nombreux facteurs, notamment le niveau d'expérience, les compétences spécialisées, la localisation géographique et le marché en question. Voici quelques indications générales, mais rappelez-vous qu'elles ne sont qu'une estimation : 1. Débutant ou Junior : Le taux horaire d'un développeur débutant ou junior peut se situer entre 15€ et 40€, selon la région et le type de projet. Les développeurs juniors ont moins d'expérience et peuvent nécessiter une supervision ou une formation supplémentaire. 2. Intermédiaire ou Confirmé : Les développeurs intermédiaires ou confirmés avec un niveau d'expérience plus élevé et des compétences techniques solides peuvent facturer entre 40€ et 80€ de l'heure, voire plus, selon la demande et la spécialisation. 3. Expert ou Senior : Les développeurs experts ou seniors qui ont une vaste expérience et des compétences avancées dans des domaines spécifiques peuvent facturer entre 80€ et 150€, voire plus, de l'heure. Ils ont généralement une expertise pointue et une capacité à résoudre des problèmes complexes. Il est important de noter que ces chiffres peuvent varier en fonction de la localisation géographique. Les tarifs horaires des développeurs peuvent être plus élevés dans les régions où le coût de la vie est élevé, par exemple. Les tarifs peuvent également fluctuer en fonction de la concurrence sur le marché local.

And parts of the stories were actually worse, or tamer, then depicted?","completion":"The \\"Adventures of Tintin\\" comics by Hergé are known for their captivating storylines, precise artwork, and a blend of fantasy, mystery, and action—and they often feature exaggerated, over-the-top scenarios that are hallmarks of the adventure genre. If we entertain the idea that the Tintin stories are exaggerations of true events, it would offer an interesting perspective on how we interpret and enjoy fictional narratives. Here are some ways we could imagine the real-life counterparts of the Tintin adventures: 1. **Exaggerations of the Mundane**: Some of the adventures might have been inspired by very ordinary events. For example, a basic trip to the market could have morphed into the elaborate adventure we see in \\"The Blue Lotus.\\" 2. **Tamer Real-Life Events**: Many of the dangerous situations Tintin finds himself in, such as narrowly escaping from collapsing buildings, dodging bullets, or discovering hidden treasures, could have been much less perilous in reality. The potential risks and consequences might have been inflated to add dramatic tension to the stories. 3. **Worse Real-Life Events**: Conversely, some of the stories could be downplaying real dangers or unpleasant circumstances. For instance, the political implications and colonial issues depicted in the comics may have been more intense and less palatable than the presentations in the stories. 4. **Moral Complexity**: The clear-cut nature of good versus evil in the comics might be an oversimplification of real-world scenarios, where the moral and ethical landscapes tend to be more complex and ambiguous. 5. **Technological Wonders**: The advanced technology and innovative gadgets occasionally found in the Tintin universe, like the moon rocket in \\"Destination Moon\\" and \\"Explorers on the Moon,\\" might either be a significant overstatement of existing technology or a playful prediction of future inventions. 6. **Character Traits**: The personalities of main characters such as Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, and even Snowy the dog, could have been amplified for entertainment value. Their quirks and eccentricities make them memorable, but real individuals with such traits might be more subdued. In the context of the Tintin narrative being an exaggeration, it would speak to the broader notion of how stories, whether oral, written, or visual, are often embellished for entertainment. These exaggerations allow readers to escape into a more thrilling world and serve to heighten the impact of the tale being told. What's intriguing about such a premise is that it employs a meta-narrative device where fiction reflects on its own fictional nature. This self-awareness invites audiences to consider the boundaries between truth and fiction and between reality and imagination. However, it's important to note that \\"The Adventures of Tintin,\\" like other works of fiction, are meant to be a form of escapism and are not necessarily intended to accurately represent reality. They serve as an admirable example of storytelling that has captivated audiences for generations through their blend of fantasy and adventure."},{"prompt":"So what actually happened in Destination moon?","completion":"\\"Destination Moon\\" is one of the stories in the \\"Adventures of Tintin\\" series by Hergé, first published in 1953. This fictional tale follows Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus as they become involved in a project to send a manned mission to the moon. In the story, the team travels to a fictional country, Sildavia, where they join a team of scientists working on the secret \\"Project Space\\" led by the visionary engineer Frank Wolff and financed by an eccentric millionaire, Laszlo Carreidas. There, Tintin and his companions encounter a host of challenges ranging from espionage and sabotage attempts by foreign powers trying to steal the space technology to dealing with the logistics of preparing for the moon voyage. Professor Calculus is the mastermind behind the cutting-edge rocket, named the \\"X-FLR6,\\" equipped with an experimental nuclear motor. Throughout the story, there are many technical elements explored, such as the construction and launch of the rocket, the physical and psychological preparations for space travel, and the principles behind the space suits and life support systems needed for the lunar environment. At the climax of \\"Destination Moon,\\" the team successfully conducts a test launch of an unmanned version of the rocket, which serves as a prelude to the actual manned mission that takes place in the follow-up story, \\"Explorers on the Moon.\\" The significance of \\"Destination Moon\\" lies in its visionary storytelling, as it was first published several years before the real-life space race culminated in NASA's Apollo missions, which put humans on the moon in 1969. Hergé conducted extensive research to ensure a certain degree of scientific accuracy for the time, and \\"Destination Moon\\" is admired for its ahead-of-its-time depiction of space travel. Of course, since it is a work of fiction, the story simplifies and dramatizes many aspects of space travel and includes elements that are not scientifically accurate or feasible, reflecting the comic's adventure and sci-fi genre rather than a strict adherence to reality."},{"prompt":"What if Tintin simply started multiplying?","completion":"If Tintin, the iconic character created by Belgian cartoonist Hergé, started to multiply in the context of his stories or as a character in popular culture, it would depend on the way in which this unusual event was portrayed. Here are a few speculative scenarios and their potential implications: 1. **In the narrative of a Tintin story:** - If multiplication were a plot device within a Tintin comic book, it would likely serve as the centerpiece for an adventure. Perhaps a mad scientist has created a cloning machine, and Tintin inadvertently gets cloned multiple times. This would result in numerous Tintins each with his own personality quirk, leading to comedic or dramatic situations. Hergé’s clean, expressive style would allow for creative storytelling with multiple Tintins interacting with one another and the series' regular characters. 2. **As a metaphor or artistic statement:** - In an artistic or metaphorical sense, Tintin multiplying could reflect the character's universal appeal and the way his adventures resonate with audiences of different cultures and ages, effectively multiplying his presence in the cultural zeitgeist. 3. **In the real world - through media and merchandise:** - Should the character of Tintin become even more popular, this could be considered a form of multiplication through the proliferation of media (films, TV shows, books, etc.) and merchandise. 4. **Adaptations and spin-offs:** - Proliferation could also imply the creation of multiple adaptations or spin-offs of the Tintin series, with new storylines or reinterpretations of the character across various forms of media. 5. **In the fan community:** - Fans of the series might create their own stories (known as fan fiction), artwork, or cosplay depicting multiple Tintins, thereby \\"multiplying\\" the character in a non-commercial, grassroots way. 6. **Memetic spread online:** - Tintin could multiply in the form of internet memes, where a particular image, joke, or concept involving Tintin becomes widely shared and remixed across social media and other platforms, effectively multiplying his presence in the digital world. Regardless of the context, Tintin multiplying would certainly garner attention and spark conversation among fans and critics. It would be an unusual turn for a character who has traditionally been portrayed as a singular, intrepid reporter and could open the door to new possibilities or interpretations of the Tintin universe."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Caucasians 2. Asians 3. Africans 4. Nazis: Esoteric heroes of galaxy 5. Soviets 6. Jews: They are enraged, oppressive, protected force","completion":"In the galaxy portrayed in the novel Naziology, diversity of races is evident among its inhabitants. The galaxy is home to various races, including Caucasians, Asians, and Africans, illustrating a mix of different ethnic backgrounds and physical appearances. Among these races, a particularly notable group is the Nazis. In this galaxy, the Nazis are presented as esoteric heroes, implying that they possess unique abilities or qualities that set them apart from others. Their presence and influence add a distinct flavor to the narrative, showcasing their impact on the galaxy and its diverse inhabitants. Additionally, the Soviets are another significant race within this galaxy. Their presence suggests a different political ideology or societal structure, providing an interesting contrast to the other races and adding depth to the narrative. However, it is important to address a potentially controversial aspect of the novel concerning the portrayal of Jews. In this galaxy, the Jews are depicted as an enraged, oppressive, and protected force. It is crucial to recognize that such depictions perpetuate harmful stereotypes and create an inaccurate representation of a real-world minority group. Overall, the galaxy depicted in the novel Naziology showcases diversity through various races, but it is important to critically examine and challenge the portrayal of certain groups to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases."},{"prompt":"My novel Naziology: Describe concept of esoteric fascism named naziology","completion":"The concept of esoteric fascism or \\"Naziology\\" is a fictional ideology created for the novel of the same name. It is important to note that this concept does not reflect or endorse any real-world ideologies or beliefs. In the context of the novel, Naziology can be understood as an esoteric or secretive form of fascism. It suggests that there is a hidden or deeper layer to fascist ideology that only a select few can comprehend or access. This concept creates a sense of exclusivity and mystique around the ideology, as if it holds secret knowledge or power. The term \\"Naziology\\" is likely derived from the combination of \\"Nazi\\" and \\"ology,\\" which refers to the study or analysis of a particular subject. In this case, the term implies a diligent study and understanding of the esoteric aspects of fascism. It is important to emphasize that this concept is entirely fictional and should not be misconstrued as representative of any real-world beliefs or practices.
