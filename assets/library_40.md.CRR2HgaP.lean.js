Углы при основании равнобедренного треугольника равны, то есть ∠А = ∠В. Дано, что ( tg А = frac{2sqrt{6}}{5} ). Тангенс угла выражается как отношение противолежащего катета к прилежащему, то есть в контексте нашего треугольника: ( tg А = frac{AC}{CB} ) Поскольку треугольник равнобедренный и АС=ВС, можно предположить, что: ( tg А = frac{AC}{AC} = frac{AC}{BC} = frac{2sqrt{6}}{5} ) Это выражение показывает, что ( AC = BC = frac{2sqrt{6}}{5}xy ), где ( x = AC ) и ( y = 1 ), в итоге: ( x = frac{2sqrt{6}}{5} cdot 1 ) Следовательно, длина стороны AC равна: ( AC = BC = frac{2sqrt{6}}{5} ) Однако, для нахождения конкретной длины AC в числовом выражении, нам нужно выразить высоту треугольника через известные данные. Высота, опущенная на основание АВ, делит его на два отрезка, каждый из которых равен 5, так как основание AB равно 10 и делится пополам в силу симметрии треугольника. Обозначим высоту через h.

It caters to the enthusiasts of drag culture—artistry, performance, and fashion that draw on the flamboyant presentation and gender fluidity. As mainstream media has embraced shows such as \\"RuPaul's Drag Race\\" and the art form itself has become more widespread, destinations known for their robust drag scenes have become sought-after by travelers who wish to experience the live glamour, comedy, and talent of drag performers. If you're looking for an experience that combines nightlife, performance art, and a celebration of diversity, drag tourism might just be for you. Understand Drag can be traced back centuries, encompassing a range of performance styles in various cultures that involve dressing in clothing typically worn by the opposite gender. In modern times, drag has become synonymous with the LGBTQ+ community, serving as a form of self-expression, social commentary, and just plain fun. Drag shows are known for their combination of lip-syncing, live singing, dancing, comedy, and fashion—often with sparkling costumes, dramatic makeup, and wigs. Destinations The popularity of drag has skyrocketed globally, but specific cities are especially known for their drag culture and communities. # North America - **New York City**: The birthplace of \\"ball culture\\" and a global epicenter for avant-garde performers. The city's queer history and nightlife offer an endless array of drag shows from dive bars to high-end clubs. - **San Francisco**: A city that’s been at the forefront of LGBTQ+ rights, and the legendary locale for diverse and trailblazing drag performances. Haight-Ashbury and The Castro are must-visit neighborhoods. - **Los Angeles**: A city of stars where the drag scene reflects the glitz and glam of Hollywood with numerous venues hosting celebrity drag queens. - **Toronto**: Canada's largest city is known for its multiculturalism, and this extends to its drag scene, with a variety of international influences bringing a unique flavor to Toronto's drag shows. # Europe - **London**: With a history of drag that goes back to the pantomime dames, this city offers a range of performances from the traditional to the raunchy. - **Berlin**: Known for its avant-garde and inclusive atmosphere, Berlin's drag scene is both edgy and accepting, with numerous clubs where drag is not just entertainment but a way of living. # Australia - **Sydney**: Home of the famed Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, this city knows how to put on a show, with many drag performances happening regularly in Oxford Street's clubs and bars. Planning Your Trip # When to Go Drag events and shows can be found year-round, but pride months, often June in many places, see a significant uptick in performances. Additionally, festivals and \\"DragCons\\" (drag conventions) are prime times to immerse oneself in the scene with a high concentration of performances and related events. # What to Expect Drag shows are highly entertaining and can vary widely in their content and style. They may be comedic, musical, theatrical, or a combination of all three. Expect audience interaction, spectacular costumes, and a night full of surprises. However, it's also important to approach these performances with respect for the art and the artists. Do - **Attend a Drag Brunch**: A drag brunch combines a dining experience with live drag performances—often more casual and interactive, perfectly paired with mimosas. - **Go to a Drag Bar or Club**: This is where you'll see more seasoned professionals performing. Reservations might be necessary. - **Visit during a Drag Festival or Convention**: These events offer a deep dive into the culture, featuring shows, discussions, and opportunities to meet the performers. Stay Safe As with any nightlife activity, it's important to stay aware of your surroundings and ensure you're in a safe environment. It's also crucial to show respect to performers and fellow attendees, understanding that drag spaces are often safe havens for marginalized communities. Respect Drag queens and kings are artists and should be treated as such. Tipping is customary in many places to show your appreciation for their performance. Moreover, always ask for consent before taking photos or touching a performer's costume or body. Connect To find out where the best drag shows are during your travels, engaging with local LGBTQ+ organizations or visiting dedicated drag venues and queer-friendly spaces can provide insights.

Пиши так словно ты реальный покупатель. Составляй правильно предложения, пиши без ошибок! Пиши с презрением. Пиши от первого лица. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера:Уж лучше с рук, чем так. Вообще не вижу разницы, кроме той, что с рук дешевле раза в два. А так ни гарантий, что вам не продадут хлам, ни адекватных цен. Вот зато бумаг целую кипу на подпись, и менеджер у компа с каждой буквой пыжится. Смотреть на это уже никакого терпения не хватало. Лучше б так машины с такой скурпулезностью проверяли, если это вообще не намеренный обман. У Ниссан Х-траил 2019 года, купленного в автосалоне три недели назад оказался очень нехило скрученный пробег. Заявлен был 45000 км. Ну при довольно ухоженном внешнем виде вопросов не возникло, ни подозрений каких-то. А позавчера перестали поворотники работать. Рейка рулевая крякнула и до кучи обнаружил что амортизаторы надо менять. Ну и оказалось, что пробег-то скручен! Тысяч двести роднуля набегала, конечно вся уже на ремонт. И самое интересное в слоне мне от ворот поворот. Мы не мы, ничего не знаем, чуть не в зашей выгнали. Охранено, конечно. И это покупка в автосалоне? Вот тебе и безопасная сделка, никто за которую ответственности не несет.","completion":"1. Полный провал, и это мягко сказано. Приобрёл в салоне \\"Акцент\\" Ford Focus, который уже на второй день показал своё истинное лицо. Двигатель начал странно шуметь, а потом и вовсе заглох на перекрёстке! Продавцы нагло уверяли, что машина в отличном состоянии, ни слова о возможных проблемах. Ощущение, что я просто выбросил кучу денег на ветер, да ещё и остался без нормального транспорта. Ни профессионализма, ни порядочности, а главное – ни малейшей заботы о клиенте! 2. Поздравляю себя, купил проблему на четырёх колёсах, а не автомобиль в автосалоне \\"Акцент\\". Volkswagen Passat, который по документам не должен был иметь недостатков, стал моим личным головняком. Каждый день что-то новое: сначала кондиционер перестал работать, потом обнаружил течь антифриза, и все это спустя пару недель после покупки! Когда обращаешься к ним, то встречают равнодушием и стандартными фразами о том, что всё это твои проблемы. Честность и качество обслуживания – явно не про этот автосалон! 3. Рекомендую обходить стороной автосалон \\"Акцент\\", если вам дороги ваши нервы и деньги. Казалось бы, обменял старенькую Toyota на \\"почти новую\\" Mazda 6, а вышло, что просто подарил им свою машину. Говорили о прекрасном состоянии, а через месяц после покупки в сервисе мне заявили, что автомобиль скорее на запчасти, а не на дорогу. Менеджеры пропадают как туман, как только возникают вопросы по гарантии и решению возникших проблем. Это какой-то абсурд, а не автосалон! 4. Уверенности больше нет – автосалон \\"Акцент\\" разрушил её окончательно. Hyundai Tucson заставил меня пожалеть о дне, когда я туда зашёл. Презентация была на высоте, говорят про проверку и полную предпродажную подготовку. Результат? Автомобиль со скрытыми дефектами, прогнивший днище и ржавчина на дверях! А когда начинаешь разбираться, то находишь стену из невежества и непонимания. \\"Акцент\\" оказался мастером на словах, но не на деле. 5. Никому не советую иметь дело с автосалоном \\"Акцент\\". Продали мне Renault Logan с темным прошлым, причём по цене как за идеальное авто. Поверил, что тут работают честные люди, а в итоге – разочарование. За красивыми фразами и улыбками менеджеров скрылись многочисленные проблемы машины: от неровно работающего двигателя до странных шумов в подвеске. Пытайся потом доказать, что это не так, как будто я сам эти проблемы за ночь создал.

La differenza sostanziale di dimensione tra i modelli generati dai due notebook (22MB contro 200MB) suggerisce che potrebbe esserci una differenza nella quantità di informazioni (parametri, pesi, ecc.) che sono effettivamente salvate o nell'efficienza della loro compressione. Ecco alcuni suggerimenti su cosa potresti fare per diagnosticare e possibilmente risolvere il problema: 1. **Verifica l'output e il formato di salvataggio**: Dovresti controllare il formato in cui ciascun notebook salva il modello. Alcuni formati potrebbero salvare unicamente i pesi aggiuntivi appresi durante il DreamBooth training invece dell'intero set di pesi LoRA, mentre altri potrebbero includere anche la struttura della rete o ulteriori informazioni di stato. 2. **Utilizzo della memoria e precisione**: Assicurati che le impostazioni relative al salvataggio dei modelli siano coerenti, in particolare in termini di precisione dei pesi (ad esempio, fp16 vs fp32) e dell'utilizzo delle ottimizzazioni di memoria (come la gradient checkpointing). 3. **Discrepanze nei parametri**: Nel codice del notebook su Colab (AutoTrain), sembra che ci siano meno parametri specificati per il training rispetto al notebook Kaggle (Kohya SS XL trainer). Prima di tutto, cerca di rendere omogenee le configurazioni, come per esempio il batch size, il learning rate, il numero di step e così via. 4. **Compatibilità con le interfacce utente (UI)**: Ogni UI potrebbe avere le proprie aspettative in termini di formato del modello e informazioni richieste. Verifica se ci sono requisiti specifici per la compatibilità con le UI che desideri utilizzare. 5. **Dipendenze e versioni**: Assicurati che le librerie e pacchetti utilizzati in entrambi i notebook siano della stessa versione. A volte, le incompatibilità o le differenze nelle librerie possono causare comportamenti inaspettati nella gestione dei modelli. 6. **Esegui il Debug**: Potresti voler fare alcuni test esportando i modelli generati da entrambi i notebook e confrontando i file risultanti. Questo potrebbe aiutarti a identificare eventuali discrepanze nei pesi salvati o nelle configurazioni. Se desideri che il modello generato da AutoTrain su Colab sia compatibile con tutte le UI, potresti dover modificare il codice in modo che salvi il modello in un formato che è noto per essere compatibile con tutte le UI che hai menzionato. Potrebbe valere la pena di verificare la documentazione di AutoTrain e di quella delle UI per trovare dettagli su come il modello dovrebbe essere salvato."},{"prompt":"شيخ عربي مسن لحيته بيضاء ويرتدي عمامة على رأسه ويبدو عليه الحكمة والوقار","completion":"الوصف الذي ذكرته يعطينا صورة نمطية عن شخصية \\"الشيخ\\" في المجتمعات العربية والإسلامية. الشيخ هنا يمكن أن يكون شخصًا مسنًا يتسم بالوقار والحكمة، والذي غالبًا ما يحظى باحترام وتقدير أفراد المجتمع. لحيته البيضاء تشير إلى تقدمه في العمر وربما إلى الخبرة والمعرفة التي اكتسبها على مدى سنوات حياته. ارتداء العمامة يعد جزءًا من الزي التقليدي في بعض الدول العربية وقد تكون أيضًا علامة على الهيبة الدينية أو الاجتماعية. في السياق الديني، قد يكون الشيخ رجل دين مسلم يشغل منصبًا روحيًا أو تعليميًا مثل إمام مسجد أو معلم في العلوم الشرعية، أو مفتى يُصدر الفتاوى الدينية. في بعض الأحيان يُطلق لقب \\"شيخ\\" كبير السن المحترم بين قومه والذي يلجأ الناس إليه للحصول على النصيحة والإرشاد في الأمور الحياتية والعائلية. ومن المهم أن نتذكر أن هذه الصورة النمطية لا تنطبق على جميع الأشخاص الذين قد يُطلق عليهم لقب \\"شيخ\\" في العالم العربي والإسلامي، حيث يمكن أن يختلف المظهر الخارجي والدور الاجتماعي أو الديني بشكل كبير من شخص لآخر."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

LA를 중심으로.” “······미국 선 개봉?” “그래요. 홍보마케팅은 최소한으로 잡고 2월 말 전까지 2주에서 3주 정도의 미국 개봉을 가면, ‘아카데미상’의 미국 내 최소 1주 개봉작품 조건을 충족할 수 있겠지.” 미국부터. 사실상 LA 중심으로 개봉을 돌리고 나머지 국가들은 차후에 개봉하자는, 급한대로 ‘아카데미상’ 조건부터 충족시키자는 얘기였다. 안가복 감독이 이번엔 힘 있게 목소리를 냈다. “‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’의 미국 쪽 홍보마케팅은 필요하지만, 강우진의 활약으로 이미 화력은 뜨거운 상태. 그러니 조금 시일을 줄여도 큰 문제는 안 됩니다.” “그렇게 무리하면서까지-” “출혈을 감수한 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’이 ‘아카데미상’에서 좋은 결과를 낸다면? 그럼 지금의 수 배를 넘어설 폭발적인 광고 효과를 내겠죠.” “······” 진중한 얼굴의 노라가 입을 다물었다. 그의 말도 일리가 있었기 때문. 실제로 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’은 이미 우진의 영향력으로 인지도가 높았다. 이 상태로 개봉해도 꽤 대박이겠지만. ‘만약, 진짜 만약 ‘아카데미상’에서 뭐든 결과를 낸다면······폭발력은 상상을 초월할 거야.’ 무려 전세계 영화인의 꿈인 ‘아카데미상’이었다. 그리고 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’의 남주는 그 강우진. 이 판이 잘만 굴러가면 희대의 작품이 탄생할지 몰랐다. 침을 꿀떡 삼킨 노라가 정리했다. “그러니까 감독님의 계획은······9월에 크랭크업, 이후 바로 편집에 돌입, 1월 안에 편집 마무리, 적절한 홍보마케팅 후 2월 내에 개봉 그러나 짧게 2주에서 3주, 조건 충족 후 ‘아카데미상’ 도전. 전세계 개봉은 그 뒤. 맞습니까?” “정확합니다.” 정리하고보니 터무니없었다. 노라가 약간은 당황섞인 목소리를 냈다. “···내가 말했지만 그야말로 지옥 같은 일정이에요. 단 하나라도 삐끗하면 실패입니다.” “알아요. 다만 아까도 말했다시피 ‘거머리’가 더 촉박했고 난 자신 있어요, 행여 삐끗해서 실패한다면 담담히 받아들여야지. 이번 ‘아카데미상’엔 연이 없구나- 하면서.” “흠.” “그리고 전체 스탭들의 도움이 필요합니다, 물론 그만큼 돈을 더 써야 하고.” 몇몇 간부들이 미간을 구기며 바로 끼어들었다. 대충 들어도 도전하는 데에 큰 리스크가 따르니까. “돈? 여기에서 돈을 더 부으라고?” 일단 가장 큰 이유는 돈 문제. 더불어. “그 모든 건 잘 됐을 때의 얘기 아닌가. 그 계획에 실패했을 시 공중분해 될 자금도 자금이지만, 도전을 해도 노미네이트 자체도 불확실해. 만약 노미네이트된다고 해도 ‘아카데미상’에서 참패하게 되면 그건 또 어찌 감당할 거지?” “동감이야. 무리해서 감행하면 전체 영화 개봉 스케줄도 박살이 나고, ‘아카데미상’에서 참패한 뒤 전세계 개봉을 하면 뭐하겠나? 무너진 이미지로 흥행에 큰 차질이 생길지 모른다고.” 다분히 나올 수 있는 문제점들이 던져졌다. 그렇다, 안가복 감독이 던진 제안은 모두 완벽했을 때의 시나리오. 헐리웃 대형 영화사의 간부들로선 현실적인 부분을 꼬집는 게 당연했다. 포장도로를 두고 굳이 험준한 비포장도로를 갈 이유는 없으니까. 이어 모두 이해한다는 듯 안가복 감독이 고개를 끄덕였다. “나는 확신을 했고 제안을 냈을 뿐. 당연히 결정은 당신들이 내려야겠죠.” 뒤로. 안가복 감독의 제안 후로도 약 1시간 이상 얘기가 오간 뒤에야 회의가 가까스로 끝났다. 아니, 이건 끝났다 표현하긴 모호했다. 워낙 큰 건에 시스템 중시인 헐리웃이었고, 뭣보다 돈이 추가로 든다. 거기다 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’의 미래까지 걸렸으니 바로 결정 나진 않았다. ‘뭐 나도 바로 될 거라 생각은 안 했지, 그러나 후회하는 거보다 밀어 붙여보는 게 나아.’ 따라서 안가복 감독이 퇴장한 후로 간부들이 심각하게 재차 회의에 들어갔다. 퍽 진중하게 받아들이고 있다는 뜻. 방대한 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’에 사활을 건 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’였다. 이 정도 리액션이 나온 것만 해도 안가복 감독에겐 큰 성공이었다. “이젠 기다려봐야겠지.” 사실, 안가복 감독은 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’가 제안을 안 받을 가능성이 더 크다고 생각했다. 이미 막대한 돈을 들여 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’를 구축했으니 말이다. 굳이 어렵거나 무리하는 길을 택하는 건 쉽지 않겠지. 하지만 노장 특유의 감이, 본능이 안가복 감독의 행위를 부추겼다. 그리고. ‘강우진이 있으니 또 다른 결말이 나올지도.’ 언제나 반전을 선사해준 우진의 모습이 간부들에게도 선명할 것. 뭐가됐든 결과는 하루 이틀 정도론 나오지 않을 터였고, 안가복 감독은 바로 백여 명 외국인 스탭들이 즐비한 세트 현장에 복귀했다. 모두가 정신없이 촬영 준비에 여념이 없었고, 그 사이 씬 구도에 관한 대화를 나누는 배우 둘이 보였다. 강우진과 크리스 하트넷. 최근 둘의 투샷 촬영이 퍽 늘었기에 붙어 있는 모습이 자주 보이는 중이었다. 이어 주변 스탭들에게 적당히 인사를 하던 안가복 감독이. -스윽. 두 배우에게 천천히 다가갔다. 인기척이 나자 강우진이나 크리스나 인사를 던졌고, 안가복 감독은 우진에게 작게 물었다. 영어가 아닌 한국어였다. “우진군, 자네는 이번 ‘아카데미상’에 나가는 게 무리라고 생각하나? 다음 ‘아카데미상’인 내후년이 낫다고 봐?” 뜬금없는 질문이었지만, 포커페이스가 진한 강우진의 표정엔 큰 변화가 없었다. 속으로만 과한 의아함이 퍼지고 있을 뿐. ‘갑자기 뭔 소리시지? 아카데미상?’ 우진은 순수하게 계산했다. 솔직히 매도 먼저 맞는 편이 당연히 낫지? 어렸을 때부터 지켜온 그의 철칙이었다. 잘못했으면 가장 빨리 손을 들고 나가 처맞는다. ‘지금까지 계속 내가 아카데미상을 언급했으니까- 당연히 조지든 말든 빠른 게 베스트지.’ 망할 수도 있다. 다만, 그때는 그때지 뭐. 딱 이 정도의 마인드였다. 그런 강우진이 목소리를 깔았다. “내후년은 제 계획에 없습니다.” 그리고 안가복 감독은 멋대로 오해했다. “그렇군, 하긴 자네에겐 올해든 내후년이든 상관없겠지. 시기만 다를 뿐 결국 자신이 상을 탈 거라 확신하는 게야, 그렇지?” 아닌데요. 그냥 빠른 게 좋다고 말씀드린 건데. 애매한 착각의 냄새가 나기에 우진은 일단 입을 다물었다. “······” 그러자 안가복 감독이 픽 웃었고. “자네의 생각을 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 쪽에 전달해줄 수 있겠나?” 한국어가 뭔 소린지 모르는 크리스가 고개를 갸웃할 때쯤, 무던한 얼굴의 강우진이 간단하게 답했다. “문제없습니다.” 며칠 뒤, 17일 수요일. LA의 ‘spt 스튜디오’. 5만 평이 넘는 세트장 초입에 많은 버스와 트럭 외의 차들이 즐비했다. 추가로 수백 외국인들이 뛰어다닌다. ‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’ 직원들과 ‘야수와 미녀’ 스탭들이었다. 그리고 세트장 내부, 거대한 성의 여러 나무들 사이 제일 크고 웅장한 나무 주변. ‘어우- 씨, 겁나 불편하네 이 옷.’ 고급진 행색의 강우진이 보인다. 흰색과 금색이 적당히 섞인 연회복에 머리는 연갈색으로 변했다. 길이도 살짝 길어졌고 뒤쪽으로 깔끔히 넘겼다. 딱 판타지에 나올법한 귀족의 모습. 겉으로는 무던했지만 속으로는 심히 어색해하는 그. 그런 우진을 백여 명 스탭들이 지켜보고 있었고 여러 카메라 찍는 중이었다. 이름 모를 기기들도 빼곡했다. 디렉팅은 총괄 감독 빌 로트너 감독이 넣는 중. “컷, 우진씨. 자세를 좀 바꿔볼까요? 거만하고 당당하게.” “예. 감독님.” 이들 전부는 현재 ‘야수와 미녀’ 1차 포스터 촬영 중이었다. 시작은 작업이 제일 많은 강우진부터였고, 다른 배우들 역시 도착해 트레일러에서 대기 중이었다. 다만 딱 한 명. ‘잘하네- 저렇게 입혀 놓으니까 또 분위기가 달라, 잘 어울려. 그 ‘광대’와는 딴판이야.’ 티 안 나게 미소짓는, 아직 분장 전인 금발의 카라는 스탭들 사이에서 구경 중이었다. 이때 감독이 강우진에게 외쳤다. “오케이! 이제 ‘야수’ 분장 갑시다!!” 첫 ‘야수’ 변신의 시간이 도래했다.","completion":"Episode 446: Villain (3) Certainty? The bald executive from 'Columbia Studio' furrowed his brow at the very firm response. The other executives also became more restless. However, there was no significant change in Director An Gabok's resolute expression. \\"......\\" He simply stared at the bald executive with a veteran's face. Producer Nora Foster, who seemed to have a stern look, was also watching him with surprise when the bald executive, who had been stroking his own bald head, asked in a calm tone of English. \\"We're aiming for this 'Academy Award'. Director, your confident demeanor is good, but - isn't it impossible timing-wise?\\" The other executives chimed in. \\"I think so too. If we estimate the wrap-up of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' to be around September... it would be beyond just rushing it.\\" \\"Right. It's not just difficult, it's impossible.\\" \\"You know that too, don't you, Director?\\" Nora didn't open her mouth as if she was just observing for now. Instead, the bald executive crossed his legs and spoke again. \\"If you're expressing your confidence as a director, I understand. But if you're really thinking about this 'Academy Award', please let us know your thoughts clearly.\\" All eyes in the conference room turned to Director An Gabok. After briefly looking into Nora's eyes, Director An Gabok turned his head to the bald man who had spoken. \\"I know, 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' is impossible to make it to this 'Academy Award' due to timing. But it's not like there's no way at all, is it?\\" \\"There's another way?\\" \\"Just one.\\" The bald executive narrowed his brow again as if a thought suddenly crossed his mind. \\"Director, you don't mean - the thing you're thinking of.\\" \\"It's probably correct.\\" Director An Gabok exhaled softly and then continued in a low voice. \\"'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', as everyone knows, will wrap up in September, originally scheduled for the end of September, but thanks to the actors' struggle, it will be moved up a bit. And this 'Academy Award' will be held next April.\\" For reference, the 'Academy Award' or 'Oscar', the most prestigious film award ceremony in the world, usually has a similar schedule every year, but it can change. This year, they select works from February of this year to February of the next year, and from March to early April, they finalize the nominees, review, and announce the results. The process is also complicated. The selection and review of nominees and nominated works are undertaken by 'Academy Award' members distributed around the world, numbering in the thousands and having the nature of jurors. The fields vary, including directors, actors, staff, key staff, etc. Then, between mid-April and the end of April, the film festival is held grandly. The problem is the conditions for obtaining a ticket to challenge the 'Academy Award'. There are several conditions, but the most basic one is that the work must be released in a movie theater in LA, USA, for at least one week during the selection period. If this is not met, they can't even challenge. This was the part the executives said was impossible. Of course, veteran Director An Gabok knew this very well. \\"To be nominated, we need to release in LA theaters by February, so the editing of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' must be finished by January. This is not impossible, 'Leech' was much tighter.\\" Although the systems in Korea and Hollywood are different, it was possible to finish editing by January if the director staked his life on it. But Nora interjected as if that wasn't the problem. \\"Director, finishing editing by January and releasing by February. This itself is not an easy task, but even if it happens, setting up a worldwide release schedule in about a month is still impossible.\\" \\"......\\" \\"You know, 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' is scheduled to be released in about 40 countries, including the US, Korea, and Japan. Just the promotional marketing and distribution work for those countries takes several months. It's a wall of reality that can't be overcome with just spirit.\\" Her words were correct. It's one thing if it were a few countries, but releasing a movie in 40 countries involves a tremendous process. Moreover, if it's to be released around the same time, it's even more so. A preparation period of at least three to six months is necessary. That's why the Columbia executives and Nora said it was impossible. The wall of reality is always huge. The executives nodded as if to say that's what they were talking about. But for some reason, Director An Gabok's calm expression did not change significantly. Then he opened his wrinkled mouth. \\"What if we do a pre-release only in the US, focusing on LA, after finishing editing in January?\\" \\"......A US pre-release?\\" \\"Yes. If we keep promotional marketing to a minimum and have a US release for about two to three weeks before the end of February, we can meet the 'Academy Award's minimum one-week release condition in the US.\\" Starting with the US. Essentially, rolling out releases centered on LA and releasing in other countries later, it was a suggestion to first meet the 'Academy Award' conditions as a matter of urgency. Director An Gabok now spoke with a strong voice. \\"'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain's US promotional marketing is necessary, but thanks to Kang Woojin's efforts, the firepower is already hot. So it won't be a big problem to shorten the time a bit.\\" \\"Going through all that trouble -\\" \\"If 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' achieves good results at the 'Academy Awards' after taking the risk? Then it will have an explosive advertising effect, surpassing several times what we have now.\\" \\"......\\" Nora closed her mouth with a serious face. His words had a point. In fact, 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' already had high recognition due to Woojin's influence. Even if it was released in this state, it would be quite a hit. 'If, just if it achieves any result at the 'Academy Awards'... the impact would be beyond imagination.' It was the 'Academy Award', the dream of filmmakers around the world. And the male lead of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' was that Kang Woojin. If things went well, an unprecedented work could be born. Nora swallowed and summarized. \\"So, Director, your plan is... wrap up in September, immediately start editing, finish editing by January, release within February after appropriate promotional marketing, but briefly for two to three weeks, meet the conditions and then challenge the 'Academy Awards'. Worldwide release follows after. Is that correct?\\" \\"Exactly.\\" After summarizing, it seemed absurd. Nora spoke with a slightly flustered voice. \\"...I said it, but it's literally a hellish schedule. If even one thing goes wrong, it's a failure.\\" \\"I know. But as I said before, 'Leech' was even tighter, and I'm confident. If it fails due to a slip-up, I'll have to accept it calmly. If there's no connection with this 'Academy Award' - then so be it.\\" \\"Hmm.\\" \\"And we'll need the help of the entire staff, of course, that means spending more money.\\" Several executives frowned and immediately interjected. Even a rough guess indicated a high risk in attempting it. \\"Money? You're saying to pour more money into this?\\" The biggest reason was the money issue. Furthermore. \\"All that's assuming everything goes well. What about the funds that will dissipate into thin air if that plan fails, and even if we do challenge, the nomination itself is uncertain. Even if we get nominated, what will you do if we suffer a defeat at the 'Academy Awards'?\\" \\"I agree. If we force it and the entire movie release schedule gets destroyed, and if we release worldwide after a defeat at the 'Academy Awards', what's the point? It could seriously disrupt the box office due to a damaged image.\\" The potential problems were thrown out. Yes, Director An Gabok's proposal was a scenario that was perfect only when everything went well. For the executives of a major Hollywood film company, it was natural to point out the realistic aspects. There's no reason to take a rough unpaved road when there's a paved highway. Then, as if everyone understood, Director An Gabok nodded. \\"I was just confident and made a suggestion. Naturally, you all have to make the decision.\\" Afterward. The meeting barely ended after about an hour of discussion following Director An Gabok's proposal. Well, it was ambiguous to say it ended. Hollywood, which prioritizes systems for such big matters, and above all, it involved additional money. The future of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' was at stake, so a decision wasn't made right away. 'I didn't think it would work out right away, but it's better to push through than to regret.' Therefore, after Director An Gabok left, the executives seriously re-entered the meeting. It meant they were taking it very seriously. It was 'Columbia Studio', which had staked its life on the vast 'Cinematic Universe'. Even this level of reaction was a big success for Director An Gabok. \\"Now I just have to wait.\\" In fact, Director An Gabok thought it was more likely that 'Columbia Studio' would not accept the proposal. They had already invested a huge amount of money in building the 'Cinematic Universe'. It wouldn't be easy to choose a difficult or forced path. But the veteran's intuition, the instinct, urged Director An Gabok's actions. And. 'With Kang Woojin there, a different outcome might come.' Woojin's always surprising reversals would be clear to the executives as well. Whatever the result, it wouldn't come in a day or two, and Director An Gabok immediately returned to the set crowded with about a hundred foreign staff. Everyone was busily preparing for the shoot, and among them, two actors discussing the scene structure were seen. Kang Woojin and Chris Hartnett. Their two-shot filming had increased recently, so they were often seen together. Then, after greeting the surrounding staff appropriately, Director An Gabok approached the two actors slowly. -Swish. As they noticed his presence, both Kang Woojin and Chris greeted him, and Director An Gabok asked Woojin in Korean, not English. \\"Woojin, do you think it's too much to go for this 'Academy Award'? Do you think the next 'Academy Award', the year after next, would be better?\\" It was an unexpected question, but Kang Woojin's expression, with a strong poker face, did not change much. Only a sense of excessive curiosity spread within him. 'What's this all of a sudden? The Academy Awards?' Woojin calculated purely. Naturally, it's better to be hit first, right? It had been his principle since he was young. If he did something wrong, he would be the first to raise his hand and go out to get hit. 'I've been mentioning the Academy Awards all this time - naturally, the sooner, the better, whether it's George or not.' It could fail. But that would be then. That was his mindset. Kang Woojin spoke with a lowered voice. \\"I have no plans for the year after next.\\" And Director An Gabok misunderstood on his own. \\"I see, well, for you, whether it's this year or the year after next doesn't matter. It's just a matter of time, you're confident you'll win the award eventually, right?\\" Not really. I just said that sooner is better. Sensing a vague misunderstanding, Woojin kept his mouth shut for the moment. \\"......\\" Then Director An Gabok chuckled. \\"Can you convey your thoughts to 'Columbia Studio'?\\" As Chris, who didn't understand Korean, looked puzzled, Kang Woojin with an indifferent face simply answered. \\"No problem.\\" A few days later, on Wednesday the 17th. At 'spt Studio' in LA. At the entrance of the set spanning over 50,000 square feet, numerous buses, trucks, and other vehicles were lined up. Additionally, hundreds of foreigners were running around. They were employees of 'Walt Disney Pictures' and staff of 'Beauty and the Beast'. And inside the set, around the largest and most majestic tree among the various trees of the huge castle. 'Ugh - geez, this outfit is so uncomfortable.' Kang Woojin, dressed in luxurious attire, was visible. His banquet clothes were a mix of white and gold, and his hair had turned light brown. It had grown slightly longer and was neatly swept back. The very image of a nobleman from a fantasy. Externally calm, but internally feeling extremely awkward. That was Woojin, being watched by about a hundred staff and being filmed by several cameras. Various devices were also packed. Director Bill Rotner was directing. \\"Cut, Woojin. Let's change the pose a bit? Arrogant and confident.\\" \\"Yes, Director.\\" All of them were currently in the middle of the first poster shoot for 'Beauty and the Beast'. It started with Kang Woojin, who had the most work, and the other actors had also arrived and were waiting in trailers. But just one person. 'He's doing well - dressed like that, the atmosphere changes, it suits him well. It's different from that 'clown'.' Blonde Kara, still before makeup, was watching among the staff without showing her smile. Then the director shouted to Kang Woojin. \\"Okay! Now let's go for the 'Beast' makeup!!\\" The time for the first transformation into the 'Beast' had arrived."},{"prompt":"448화 빌런 (5) ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 대회의실에 무거운 적막이 스몄다. 모인 인원은 많지만 그 누구도 입을 열지 않았다. 방금 민머리 간부가 ‘강우진의 ‘조커(Joker)’를 포기할 거냐’는 물음을 던졌기 때문. 이미 우진의 ‘조커(Joker)’를 맛본 그들이었다. ‘······안 되지, 딴 건 몰라도 강우진은 잡아야 해.’ ‘그 누가 지금의 ‘조커(Joker)’ 이상을 보일 수 있겠어. 힘들 거야.‘ 아예 못 봤으면 모를까, 이미 절여진 이들은 강우진의 ‘조커(Joker)’가 아니면 안 되는 몸이 돼버렸다. 이상하진 않았다. ‘진짜’인 강우진이 빠지면, 차후 어떤 배우를 들인다 해도 결국 ‘흉내’일 뿐일 테니. 두려움이 엄습한 모두를 보던 민머리 간부가. ‘좋군, 먹혔어.’ 옅은 미소를 띠며 말을 이었다. “왜 다른 실패들은 두려워하면서 강우진에 관한 건 생각들을 못 하는 건가. 사실상 그가 후속작을 안 하는 것만큼 큰 실패가 또 있나? 그를 놓치는 건 회복 불가능의 실패가 될 거야.” “······” “이번 작품이면 모를까, ‘조커(Joker)’가 나와야 하는 게 몇 갠가? 분명, 강우진의 ‘조커(Joker)’는 격렬히 사랑받을 거야. 선과 악, 어떤 캐릭터든 사랑받으면 배우 교체 시 반발이 일어나지만- 다들 알다시피 사랑받은 악역의 힘은 그 어떤 캐릭터보다 힘이 거대해.” 사실이었다. 보통 악역은 미움을 받는 역할이지만, 배우의 역량이 대단하다면 미움과 함께 인정을 받는다. 그것이 작품을 끌어가는 대들보 역할을 하기도 한다. “우리의 ‘조커(Joker)’를 믿어주자고. 분명 불명확한 것에 베팅하기엔 판이 크지만, ‘시네마틱 유니버스’의 주사위가 던져진 이상 우린 나무가 아닌 숲을 봐야 하네.” 여기서 슬슬 숨기고 있던 본심을 뱉는 이가 한둘 나왔다. “그래, 나 역시 그렇게 생각해. 난 솔직히 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’이 ‘아카데미상’에서 참패할 거라 생각하진 않아.” “‘아카데미상’이 그 터무니없는 연기를 못 알아볼 리 없지.” “리스크를 감수한 만큼 얻는 것도 커.” 천천히 고개 끄덕인 민머리 간부가 주도권을 다시 잡았다. “강우진은 칸에서부터 에미상까지 전부 ‘아카데미상’을 언급해왔지, 덕분에 그의 파급력이나 영향력은 말로 표현 못 할 정도고. 그마저도 매일 갱신 중이야. 나도 안가복 감독의 말에 동의해. 이 타이밍에, 흐름에 밀어야 심지어 불이 붙을 거야. 만약, 터지면 핵폭탄 이상일 것이고.” 말을 마친 민머리 간부가 잠시잠깐 말을 멈춘 뒤 호흡을 정렬했다. 모두에게 생각할 시간을 준 것. 이어 다시 입을 여는 그. “칸, 에미상에 이어 ‘아카데미상’에서까지 강우진이 트로피를 들어 올린다면-” 자신이 말하면서도 소름이 돋는 민머리 간부였다. “‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’이 가지는 파워가 얼마나 폭증될지 상상이나 가나? 빌런과 동시에 세계 최고의 배우가 탄생하는 걸 거야.” 상상이 가지만 상상할 수 없는 것이었다. 강우진의 위세는 현재도 자라고 있고, 그쯤이면 또 얼마나 성장해 있을지 아무도 모른다. “세계가 ‘조커(Joker)’를 울부짖을 거라고. 다들 그 장면을 보고 싶지 않나?” 이틀 뒤 20일. 늦은 아침. ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 내의 거대 세트단지 중 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’ 팀이 분주히 움직이고 있다. 오늘은 장소를 두 번 옮길 예정이었다. 세트 촬영에 반나절, 야외 로케 촬영에 반나절. 그러니 하루 일정에 차질이 있어선 안 됐고. “배우들 스탠바이!!” “바로 전달하겠습니다!!!” 백여 명 이상의 외국인 스탭들은 손과 발이 척척 맞아떨어졌다. 마치 이 현장이 하나의 기계처럼 보일 지경. 이것이 헐리웃의 장점이자 시스템이다. 원래 헐리웃 쪽은 프리 프로덕션을 꼼꼼하고 길게 가져가고, 그만큼 촬영 기간이 생각보다 짧다. 한국보다 짧은 작품도 수두룩했고 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’도 마찬가지. ‘야수와 미녀’ 포스터 촬영을 마친 강우진은 이틀 전 촬영에 복귀했다. 따라서 오늘 첫 씬도 우진의 컷이었고, 안가복 감독은 키스탭들들과 모여 촬영 콘티 관련으로 대화 중. 그런 모두를 팔짱 낀 채 지켜보는 이가 있으니. “······” 인상이 세다 싶은, 이 현장의 총괄 프로듀서 노라 포스터였다. 잠시간 현장을 지켜보던 그녀가 숨을 뱉으며 단발보다 조금 긴 머리를 쓸었다. 안도의 몸짓. 촬영은 어느새 중후반부에 접어들었지만, 감독도 스탭도 배우도 급해 보이지는 않는다. 이때. -♬♪ 노라의 핸드폰이 울렸다. 두 걸음 정도 떨어져서 핸드폰을 확인한 그녀가 약간 놀란다. 상대가 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’였으니까. 일전 안가복 감독의 제안 관련 결과일 게 분명했다. 곧, 노라가 핸드폰을 귀에 붙였고. “네, 저예요.” 핸드폰 반대편에선 남자 목소리가 들렸다. “노라.” 목소리를 들어보니 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’의 민머리 간부 같았다. 그런 그의 음성이 재차 들리자 노라의 눈이 약간 커졌다. “저, 정말?” 그렇게 잠시간 통화를 하던 노라가 핸드폰을 내렸다. 허나 놀란 얼굴은 그대로. 표정만으론 판단하기 어렵다. 그녀는 몇십 초 정도 멀뚱히 서 있었다. ‘이게 무슨 일이야??’ 속으로는 믿기지 않는다는 투였다. 이어 노라가 급작스레 몸을 휙 돌리더니. -슥. 현장 쪽으로 성큼성큼 걸었다. 방향을 보니 한창 바쁜 안가복 감독 쪽이었다. 어느새 그에게 도달한 노라가 안가복 감독의 팔뚝을 붙잡았다. “감독님.” 깜짝이야! 정도의 얼굴로 안가복 감독이 되물었다. “노라? 무슨 일입니까?” “됐어요.” “예? 뭘 말하는 거죠?” “나도 이게 진짜 될 줄은.” “······설마.” “그래요.” 놀람에서 미소까지 첨가된 노라가 안가복 감독에게 답했다. “감독님의 제안이 먹혔어요. ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’는 감독님이 제안한 스케줄대로 움직이겠다고 연락받았어요.” 안가복 감독은 잠시간 노라를 응시하다가 티 안 나게 주먹을 쥐었다. 나름의 파이팅 포즈였다. 이를 눈치 못 챈 노라가 설명을 추가했다. 점차 흥분하는 건 덤. “심지어 추가되는 자금까지 지원을 아끼지 않겠다는 멘트도 있었다구요! 서포트는 영화사에서 알아서 할 테니, 감독님과 스탭 그리고 배우들은 촬영에만 집중해달라. 여기까지예요.” 마찬가지로 안가복 감독도 주름진 웃음을 지었다. “···바빠지겠네요, 하지만 열정적인 바쁨일 테고.” 잠시 뒤. 소식을 접한 안가복 감독은 일단 키스탭들부터 소집했다. 차후 프로듀서인 노라가 정식적으로 진행을 하겠지만, 감독으로서 먼저 스탭들에게 양해 겸 진행될 미래를 알려야 할 생각이었다. “먼저- 우리 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’은 ‘아카데미상’에 도전합니다.” “오오!” “그래! 충분히 가능하지!” 여러 키스탭들은 ‘아카데미상’엔 전투력을 불살랐다. 헐리웃에 있는 누구라도 꿈의 무대니까. 하지만 안가복 감독의 다음 멘트에서 대부분이 당황했다. “하지만 도전하는 것은 내후년 것이 아닌, 내년에 열리는 이번 ‘아카데미상’이 될 겁니다.” “······에?” 황당해하는 건 자연스러운 현상이었다. 여기 키스탭들도 전부 베테랑이고, 내년 ‘아카데미상’이 4월에 열리고 그 과정이 어떻게 굴러가는지 다 알고 있으니까. 처음엔 모두가 안가복 감독의 장난이라 생각했다. 허나. “내가 영화사에 한 제안은 이렇습니다.” 안가복 감독의 진심어린 브리핑이 이어지자 모두의 표정이 단숨에 굳어졌다. 반쯤은 기백에 서렸고 반쯤은 의아함이 가득. 어쨌든 노장 감독은 꿋꿋하게 할 말을 모두 해냈다. 핵심은 영화사에 말한 것처럼 미국 LA 먼저 선 개봉해 조건을 맞추고 4월인 ‘아카데미상’에 도전하는 것. 문제는 역시나. “그, 그게 가능은 한 겁니까?” 터무니없이 촉박한 기간이었다. 하지만 안가복 감독은 모두를 다독이듯이 차분하게 답했다. “충분히 할 수 있어요. 난 이미 ‘거머리’에서 가능성을 봤습니다, 물론 모두의 도움이 필요합니다.” 천천히 안가복 감독은 왜 자신이 이런 제안을 했는지부터, 만약 잘됐을 때의 파급력 등을 설명했다. 다행히 점차 키스탭들의 반응에 이해나 전투력이 실렸다. “그래요, 까짓거 해보는 거지!” “재밌겠는걸? ‘아카데미상’ 정도 되면 이정도 노력은 해줘야지!” “하하하, 이렇게 되면 ‘에미상’ 레드카펫을 밟은 ‘조커(Joker)’가 ‘아카데미상’까지 진출하는 건가??” “일단 노미네이트부터 받아야지!” “‘조커(Joker)’라면 멋대로 갈 것 같지 않아?” “그건 그렇군, 하하.” 모두가 합류하는 듯 보였다. 안가복 감독이 노라를 슬쩍 봤다. 그녀가 고개를 끄덕였다. 이 뒤인 ‘현실적’ 얘기는 노라의 몫이었으니까. 이어 주변이 금방 왁자지껄 시끄러워졌고 안가복 감독은 조용히 숨을 내쉬었다. ‘이제부턴 속도전이야.’ 그가 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 쪽에 한 설계대로 굴러가기 위해선, 현재부터 단 1초로 쉴 시간이 없긴 했다. 이때 현장으로 배우들이 진입했다. 그중 무심한 얼굴인, 현재는 ‘헨리 고든’의 분장을 한 강우진을 발견한 노라. ‘강우진-’ 그녀가 미소를 짙게 하며 속으로 읊조렸다. ‘그 거대한 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’가 저 배우의 ‘조커(Joker)’에 베팅을 걸 줄이야.’ 진심이 서렸다. ‘아니, 이 정도면 올인의 수준이지.’ 후로. 이번 ‘아카데미상’ 행이 확정된 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’은 당연히 속도를 높였다. 촬영 스케줄 역시 변할 게 빤했다. 어차피 9월 중으로 크랭크업이었지만, 단 하루라도 절약하는 것이 도움이 되니까. 이게 가능하게 된 것은 역시 키스탭들이나 강우진을 포함한 배우들의 동의였다. 물론, 목숨을 갈며 제일 많이 분투하는 건 안가복 감독이겠지만, 다른 이들의 도움이 없다면 분투해봤자 허사였다. 의외로 배우들의 반응은 기대감이 넘쳤다. 우진과 부쩍 친해진 크리스는 강우진의 어깨를 부여잡아댔고. “우진! 드디어 ‘아카데미상’까지 섭렵하는 건가? 잠깐만, 그럼 나도 뭐라도 받아야겠는걸??” 나머지 배우들도 비슷했다. 더불어 이 건은 당연히 극비로 정해졌다. 개봉 전까지 철저히 비밀을 지킨다. 그도 그럴 게 이런 일인 만큼 괜히 잡소리, 소문이 돌면 엎어지기에 십상이니까. 강우진은 떨리긴 했지만 내색하지 않았다. 쎈척도 쎈척이지만, 이럴 땐 큰 기대를 안 하는 게 낫다는 판단. ‘그래도 내년 4월 아카뎀상이면 개빠르긴 하네.’ 뭐가됐든 우진은 자신의 분량, 연기에 평소보다 몇 배는 더 집중하긴 해야 했다. 곧, ‘야수와 미녀’ 첫 촬영날이니까. 전에 자신의 씬을 최대한 많이 빼야 한다. 그렇게 강우진은 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’ 촬영에 박차를 가한다. 하루가 가고 이틀이 가고. 다들 의욕이 폭발이라 그런지 분, 시간, 하루가 어떻게 녹는지 알아차릴 새도 없었다. 사이에 이제 첫 촬영이 당도한 ‘야수와 미녀’ 쪽도 바빴다. 『CNM/논란과 화제의 실사화 작품 ‘야수와 미녀’, 9월 1일 첫 촬영 확정!』 『LA TIME/‘월드 디즈니 픽쳐스’의 ‘야수와 미녀’ 첫 촬영까지 1주일 남았다, 강우진 마일리 카라 등 합은 어떨까?』 헐리웃 외로 첫 촬영 소식과 홍보를 돌리면서도 촬영 준비 마무리 단계에 접어들었다. 한편, 한국에서도 희소식이 목전인 작품이 존재했다. 『[이슈톡]‘에미상’ 6관왕의 기적! ‘이로운 악’ 파트2, 오는 9월 19일 월요일 오픈 확정』 헐리웃 포함 세계에 기적을 보였던, 최근 파트2 편집이 끝난 ‘이로운 악’의 런칭일자가 확정된 것. 『‘이로운 악’ 파트2 런칭 확정 소식이 해외팬들 들썩, ‘에미상’의 파워!』 『‘에미상 남우주연상’ 강우진, ‘이로운 악’ 파트2에서도 해외팬들 감동시켜줄까?』 이미 넷플렉스는 빵빵한 홍보를 돌리고 있었다. 추가로 강우진의 SNS나 ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널에도 홍보 영상이 추가됐다. 과거와는 화력이 차원이 달랐다. 보니 9월에 많은 것이 몰려 있었다. 그리고 강우진은 생각했다. ‘와- 그러고 보니 벌써 9월이냐? 한 해가 벌써 끝나가네?’ 시간이 참 빠르다고. 실제로 시간이 녹아 없어졌다는 걸 우진이 체감한 건, 새벽녘 그가 침대에서 눈을 떴을 때였다. “어으- 눈부셔.” 부스스 시간을 확인하는 강우진. -9월 1일/ AM 5:11 9월 첫날이 밝는 것은 눈 깜짝할 새였다.","completion":"Episode 448: Villain (5) A heavy silence enveloped the large conference room of 'Columbia Studio'. Many people were gathered, but no one spoke. The silence followed a question from the bald executive about whether they would give up on 'Kang Woojin's 'Joker'.' They had already experienced Woojin's 'Joker'. \\"...It's not possible, we have to secure Kang Woojin, no matter what.\\" \\"Who else could show a 'Joker' beyond what Kang Woojin has shown? It's going to be tough.\\" If they hadn't seen it, it might be different, but those who had been marinated in Woojin's 'Joker' couldn't settle for anything less. It wasn't strange. Without the 'real' Kang Woojin, any other actor would merely be an imitation. Seeing everyone gripped by fear, the bald executive thought to himself, 'Good, it's taken hold.' He continued with a faint smile. \\"Why are you all afraid of other failures but can't think about Kang Woojin? Isn't his refusal to do a sequel as big a failure as it gets? Losing him would be an irrecoverable failure.\\" \\"......\\" \\"This project might be one thing, but how many 'Joker' movies are there to come? Certainly, Kang Woojin's 'Joker' will be passionately loved. Whether it's a hero or villain, when a character is loved, replacing the actor always causes backlash - but as you all know, the power of a beloved villain is greater than any other character.\\" It was true. Normally, villains are hated, but if the actor's performance is outstanding, they receive recognition along with the hatred. They can become the cornerstone that carries the work. \\"Let's trust our 'Joker'. The stakes may be high for such an uncertain bet, but since the dice have been cast for the 'Cinematic Universe', we must look at the forest, not just the trees.\\" Now, one or two began to reveal their true feelings. \\"Yes, I think so too. Honestly, I don't think 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' will fail at the 'Academy Awards'.\\" \\"The 'Academy Awards' can't ignore such an outrageous performance.\\" \\"The greater the risk we take, the greater the reward.\\" The bald executive nodded slowly, regaining control of the conversation. \\"Kang Woojin has been mentioning the 'Academy Awards' since Cannes to the Emmys, and his influence is indescribable, and it's still growing every day. I agree with Director An Gabok. At this timing, pushing the flow will even ignite a fire. If it explodes, it will be more than a nuclear bomb.\\" After finishing his speech, the bald executive paused briefly to let everyone think. Then he continued. \\"If Kang Woojin lifts a trophy at the 'Academy Awards' following Cannes and the Emmys -\\" Even as he spoke, the bald executive felt chills. \\"Can you imagine how much power 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' will gain? We'll witness the birth of the world's greatest actor alongside the villain.\\" It was imaginable, yet unimaginable. Kang Woojin's influence was already growing, and no one knew how much more it would grow by then. \\"The world will cry out for the 'Joker'. Don't you all want to see that scene?\\" Two days later, on the 20th, late morning. The huge set complex of 'Columbia Studio' was bustling with activity from the 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' team. Today, they planned to move locations twice. Half a day for set shooting, half a day for outdoor location shooting. There could be no delays in the day's schedule. \\"Actors, stand by!!\\" \\"Will relay immediately!!!\\" The hundred-plus foreign staff worked in perfect harmony, as if the set was a single machine. This was the advantage and system of Hollywood. Hollywood typically has a meticulous and lengthy pre-production, and as a result, the shooting period is shorter than one might think. Many projects are shorter than in Korea, and 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' was no exception. Kang Woojin, who had finished the 'Beauty and the Beast' poster shoot, had returned to filming two days ago. Therefore, today's first scene was Woojin's cut, and Director An Gabok was discussing the shooting continuity with key staff. Watching them all with crossed arms was someone with a stern look. \\"......\\" It was Nora Foster, the overall producer of the scene. After watching the set for a while, she exhaled and ran her fingers through her slightly longer than shoulder-length hair. A gesture of relief. Although the shooting had already entered the mid-to-late stages, the director, staff, and actors didn't seem rushed. Then. -♬♪ Nora's phone rang. She stepped away to check it and was slightly surprised. The caller was 'Columbia Studio'. It was surely about the outcome of Director An Gabok's proposal. Soon, Nora put the phone to her ear. \\"Yes, it's me.\\" A male voice came from the other end. \\"Nora.\\" Judging by the voice, it seemed to be the bald executive from 'Columbia Studio'. As he spoke again, Nora's eyes widened slightly. \\"Really?\\" After a brief conversation, Nora put down the phone. Her face was still surprised. It was hard to judge just by her expression. She stood there for several seconds, dumbfounded. 'What's going on??' Internally, she couldn't believe it. Then Nora suddenly turned around. -Swish. She strode towards the set, heading towards the busy Director An Gabok. She reached him and grabbed his forearm. \\"Director.\\" With a face that said 'what the heck!', Director An Gabok replied. \\"Nora? What's the matter?\\" \\"It's done.\\" \\"What? What are you talking about?\\" \\"I didn't think it would really happen.\\" \\"......Could it be?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Nora, with a smile added to her surprise, answered Director An Gabok. \\"Your proposal was accepted. 'Columbia Studio' contacted me saying they will proceed with the schedule you proposed.\\" Director An Gabok stared at Nora for a moment and then clenched his fist discreetly. It was his own way of showing fighting spirit. Unaware of this, Nora added more details, her excitement growing. \\"They even said they wouldn't spare any support for the additional funds! The film company will handle the support, so the director, staff, and actors should focus only on filming. That's all.\\" Director An Gabok also smiled with his wrinkled face. \\"...We're going to be busy, but it will be a passionate busyness.\\" Shortly after. Having heard the news, Director An Gabok first gathered the key staff. Producer Nora would formally proceed with the process, but as the director, he thought it was necessary to first inform the staff about the future developments and ask for their understanding. \\"First - our 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' will challenge the 'Academy Awards'.\\" \\"Oh!\\" \\"Yeah! It's definitely possible!\\" The key staff were fired up about the 'Academy Awards'. It was the stage of dreams for anyone in Hollywood. However, most were taken aback by Director An Gabok's next statement. \\"However, the challenge will not be for the 'Academy Awards' the year after next, but for the upcoming 'Academy Awards' next year.\\" \\"......Eh?\\" It was a natural reaction of astonishment. The key staff were all veterans and knew how the 'Academy Awards' next year in April would proceed. At first, everyone thought Director An Gabok was joking. But. \\"This is the proposal I made to the film company.\\" As Director An Gabok's sincere briefing continued, everyone's expressions hardened instantly. Half were bolstered by spirit, half were filled with bewilderment. Regardless, the veteran director firmly said everything he had to say. The key point was to first do a pre-release in LA, USA, to meet the conditions and then challenge the 'Academy Awards' in April. The issue, of course, was. \\"Is that even possible?\\" The timeframe was absurdly tight. However, Director An Gabok calmly reassured everyone. \\"We can definitely do it. I've already seen the possibility in 'Leech', but of course, we need everyone's help.\\" Slowly, Director An Gabok explained why he made such a proposal and the potential impact if it went well. Fortunately, the key staff gradually showed understanding and fighting spirit. \\"Let's do it, why not!\\" \\"It'll be fun, right? For the 'Academy Awards', we should put in this much effort!\\" \\"Hahaha, does this mean the 'Joker' who stepped on the 'Emmy Awards' red carpet is now advancing to the 'Academy Awards'??\\" \\"First, we need to get nominated!\\" \\"The 'Joker' seems like he'll go his own way, doesn't he?\\" \\"That's true, haha.\\" It seemed like everyone was on board. Director An Gabok glanced at Nora. She nodded. The 'realistic' discussions that followed were Nora's responsibility. The surroundings quickly became noisy, and Director An Gabok quietly exhaled. 'It's a race against time now.' If things were to proceed as he had designed with 'Columbia Studio', there was no time to rest, not even for a second. At that moment, the actors entered the set. Among them, Nora spotted Kang Woojin, who was currently in 'Henry Gordon' makeup, with an indifferent face. 'Kang Woojin -' She thought to herself with a deep smile. 'That huge 'Columbia Studio' is betting on that actor's 'Joker'.' She was genuinely moved. 'No, at this point, it's an all-in.' Afterward. 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', now confirmed for the 'Academy Awards', naturally accelerated its pace. The shooting schedule was bound to change. The wrap-up was already set for mid-September, but saving even a single day would help. This was made possible by the agreement of the key staff and actors, including Kang Woojin. Of course, Director An Gabok would be the one struggling the most, but without the help of others, the struggle would be in vain. Surprisingly, the actors were filled with anticipation. Chris, who had become quite close to Woojin, clung to Kang Woojin's shoulder. \\"Woojin! Are we finally conquering the 'Academy Awards'? Wait, does that mean I need to win something too??\\" The other actors felt similarly. Furthermore, this matter was naturally kept top secret. They would keep it strictly confidential until the release. Because for such an event, careless talk and rumors could easily lead to failure. Kang Woojin felt nervous but didn't show it. Pretending to be tough was one thing, but at times like this, it was better not to have high expectations. 'But next April's Academy Awards are really soon.' Regardless, Woojin had to focus several times more on his parts and acting than usual. Soon, it would be the first day of shooting for 'Beauty and the Beast'. He had to get as many of his scenes out of the way as possible. Thus, Kang Woojin put his all into the shooting of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. Days passed, and everyone was so motivated that time seemed to melt away without notice. In the meantime, 'Beauty and the Beast' was also busy with its first day of shooting approaching. \\"CNM/Controversial and hotly anticipated live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' confirms first day of shooting on September 1st!\\" \\"LA TIME/'Walt Disney Pictures' 'Beauty and the Beast' has one week left until the first day of shooting, what will the combination of Kang Woojin, Miley, and Kara be like?\\" While spreading the news and promotions for the first day of shooting outside Hollywood, they were also entering the final stages of shooting preparation. Meanwhile, in Korea, there was also a project on the verge of good news. \\"[Issue Talk] The miracle of 6 Emmy Awards! 'Beneficial Evil' Part 2, confirmed to open on Monday, September 19th\\" The launch date for 'Beneficial Evil' Part 2, which had recently finished editing and had shown a miracle to the world including Hollywood, was confirmed. \\"'Beneficial Evil' Part 2 launch confirmed, overseas fans excited, the power of the Emmy Awards!\\" \\"Will 'Emmy Award Best Actor' Kang Woojin move overseas fans again in 'Beneficial Evil' Part 2?\\" Netflix was already rolling out strong promotions. Additionally, promotional videos were added to Kang Woojin's SNS and 'Kang Woojin's Alternate Character' channel. The firepower was on a different level compared to the past. It seemed a lot was converging in September. And Kang Woojin thought to himself. \\"Wow - is it already September? The year is already coming to an end?\\" Time flies indeed. Woojin actually felt time disappearing when he woke up in bed at dawn. \\"Ugh - it's so bright.\\" Kang Woojin groggily checked the time. -September 1st / AM 5:11 The first day of September had arrived in the blink of an eye."},{"prompt":"rispondi in italiano.

Questi parametri possono influenzare il modo in cui il modello viene addestrato e potenzialmente la struttura del modello finale. 4. **Formato di salvataggio del modello**: La procedura Kohya specifica il flag \`--save_model_as=safetensors\`, che potrebbe indicare un formato di salvataggio particolare. Si noti che questo formato tende a risparmiare spazio e potrebbe spiegare la differenza nelle dimensioni del file. **Suggerimenti per ottenere un modello LoRA più compatibile da AutoTrain:** - Esaminare se è possibile specificare ulteriori flag o opzioni durante il processo di addestramento con AutoTrain che consentono una maggiore customizzazione del modello, come quelli usati in Kohya. - Verificare se esiste una configurazione per salvare il modello nel formato \`safetensors\` utilizzando AutoTrain. Potrebbero esserci opzioni nella documentazione di \`autotrain-advanced\` che permettono questo tipo di salvataggio. - Considerare l'utilizzo delle stesse tecniche di regolarizzazione e lo stesso learning rate in entrambi gli script per ottenere risultati più coerenti. - Potrebbe essere necessario esaminare più a fondo la documentazione o contattare gli sviluppatori di AutoTrain per capire meglio come modificare la configurazione in modo da produrre un modello che sia più in linea con quello generato da Kohya SS XL Trainer. Tuttavia, ci sono limitazioni su quanto possa essere moddato AutoTrain se non consente la stessa configurabilità avanzata di Kohya SS XL Trainer. In tal caso, potrebbe essere necessario adattare il setup di Kohya per farlo funzionare su Google Colab, se questo non ha limitazioni che impediscono l'esecuzione dello script Kohya (ad esempio, limiti di memoria o di tempo di esecuzione)."},{"prompt":"Can I tell you about a made-up movie studio I came up with?","completion":"Absolutely!

I'm here to listen and discuss your creative ideas with you."},{"prompt":"That movie studio was known as AkinaEntertainments and it was the most famous movie studio in osaka between 2007 to 2012 before it went broke because a random horse went into the studio and rekt everything in it.","completion":"What an intriguing and unfortunate turn of events for AkinaEntertainments! It's quite interesting that it held the title as the most famous movie studio in Osaka for a good five years. That suggests it must have produced some quality content or had a significant impact on the film industry during that time. Here's a possible backstory for AkinaEntreatinments: **Foundation and Rise to Fame:** AkinaEntertainments was founded by a visionary film producer, Hiroshi Akina, who wanted to create a studio that blended traditional Japanese storytelling with modern cinematic techniques. The studio gained fame for its unique blend of genres, often mixing elements of drama, fantasy, and technology, creating groundbreaking visual effects that captivated audiences both locally and internationally. **Notable Work:** The studio was perhaps best known for its epic fantasy trilogy, \\"The Samurai of the Stars,\\" which combined samurai culture with space opera elements, creating a cult following and winning several awards in various film festivals around the world. **The Studio Lot and Community Impact:** Located in the heart of Osaka, the AkinaEntertainments studio lot became a beloved landmark. The studio actively engaged with the local community, offering film workshops and hosting annual film festivals, which helped nurture a new generation of filmmakers and enthusiasts in the region. **Downfall:** The studio's unexpected downfall began when, during a busy production season, a random horse somehow managed to breach studio security. The horse, likely spooked and in a panic, galloped through the studio's various soundstages and sets, causing chaos. Equipment was destroyed, sets were knocked over, and the damage ran into the millions of yen. Unfortunately, AkinaEntertainments was already financially leveraged due to its ambitious projects, and this disaster proved to be the tipping point. **Legacy:** Although the studio went bankrupt and was forced to close its doors, its legacy lived on in the filmmakers it inspired and the advancements it made in the film industry. The films produced by AkinaEntertainments continued to be celebrated and studied by cinephiles and aspiring directors. The story of AkinaEntertainments serves as a reminder of the fragility of creative ventures and the unexpected events that can lead to their downfall. Nevertheless, the studio's influence on the art of filmmaking in Osaka during its heyday remains a cherished chapter in the city's cultural history."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

분장에 각오까지 필요한가? 의아했다. 우진에게 가장 센 분장이라면 역시 최근의 ‘조커(Joker)’. 매번 1시간씩은 소요된다. ‘야수’의 레벨이 높으니 조금 더 걸리는 수준? ‘뭐 감독한테 듣긴 했어, 꽤 걸릴 거라고. ‘조커(Joker)’보다야 복잡하니까 2시간 정도 될라나?’ 생각보다 가볍게 마음먹은 강우진이 다시 발을 움직였다. 그의 목적지는 세트 초입에 설치된 여러 트레일러 쪽. 그중에 가장 큰 것이 분장팀의 본부였다. 곧, 세트 초입에서 강우진이 또 한 명의 여배우와 만났다. 분장을 마친 마리아 아르마스였다. 머리 색 전체가 갈색으로 변했고 파마기가 돌았다. 의상은 베이지 드레스에 흰색 앞치마를 했다. ‘왕자’의 성에서 일하는 직원다운 모습. 재밌는 것은. ‘주전자를 들었네.’ 마리아의 손에 하얀색에 여러 문양이 찍힌 주전자가 들렸다는 것. 자신이 이 주전자로 변한다는 암시를 포스터에 보여줄 것이라 그렇다. 아마 다음 촬영 차례가 그녀인 듯. 마리아는 우진과 눈을 맞췄으나 딱히 말은 하지 않았다. “······” 그저 새침스런 표정으로 지나갈 뿐. 우진 역시 별수롭진 않았지만 왜인지 골리고 싶은 마음도 들었다. ‘나중에 촬영 드가면 쟤한테 포효할 때 좀 세게 해야지, 쨌든 내 직원이니까 상관없을 듯.’ 혼자 재밌는 목표가 생긴 강우진이 분장팀 트레일러에 입장했다. ‘왕자’ 모습을 위해 이미 한 번 와봤지만, 왜인지 강우진은 처음과 달리 이번에는 퍽 놀랐다. 물론 내면으로만. ‘와- 씨, 저거 뭐여? 저것들을 나한테 붙인다고??!’ 분장팀 트레일러 내부에 커다란 뿔이며 수북한 갈색 털이 보였으니까. 그뿐인가? 뭔지 모를 징그러운 가죽이나 별의별 소품들이 가득했다. 저도 모르게 멈칫한 강우진. 그냥 ‘아 잘못 들어왔네요, 하하.’ 하면서 나가고 싶은 마음이 들었다. 하지만 쎈척 짙은 그는 의연해야 했다. ‘몰라 씨, 뒤지기야 하겠냐고.’ 전문가 냄새 풀풀 풍기는 외국인 스탭들이 마음 단단히 먹은 강우진을 발견하곤. “여기 앉으세요, 우진씨.” 웃으며 반겼다. 우진은 덤덤한 척 스탭이 안내한 의자에 앉았다. 경험한 적은 없지만 고문 의자에 앉는 느낌이 들었고, 뒤쪽에 선 분장팀 메인이 강우진의 어깨를 툭툭 두드렸다. “좀 쉬세요, ‘야수’ 분장 마무리까지 3~4시간 걸릴 거예요.” “······4시간.” “네, 좀 길죠? 그나마 풀세팅은 아니라서 4시간 정도예요. 나쁘지 않은 편이랄까? 혹시 중간에 힘드시면 말씀하세요.” “아니요, 그럴 일 없을 겁니다.” 본능적으로 허세를 가미한 우진이 속으로 맹렬히 외쳤다. ‘4시간??!!! 돌았나? 말이 돼?!’ 말이 된다. 헐리웃에선 그보다 두 배 이상 걸리는 분장도 있을 정도니 말이다. 하지만 첫 경험인 강우진은 충격받는 게 당연했다. 곧, 스탭 여러 명이 우진에게 달라붙을 때였다. 돌연 강우진이 스탭들에게 요청했다. “시나리오를 좀 주세요.” 꼼수였다. 이후. 희망의 끈인 시나리오를 손에 쥔 강우진. 그의 얼굴에 여러 것들이 시작됐다. 동시에 분장팀 메인 스탭이 재차 웃으며 설명했다. “그래도 ‘야수’ 분장은 촬영 안에 그리 많진 않을 거예요, 이번 포스터 촬영이랑 본 촬영 중 몇 번 정도고······” 그녀의 브리핑이 우진의 귀엔 잘 들리지 않았다. 점점 얼굴에 붙는 것들 때문에 묵직해지고 있었으니까. 하지만 스탭의 설명은 끊기질 않았다. “본 촬영 중 거의 80% 이상은 특수 촬영 전용 의상을 입게 될 거라- 아, 의상 본 적 있으시죠? 그 몸에 딱 붙는.” 아직 못 봤지만 우진이 대강 답했다. “예, 압니다.” 그렇게 4시간의 시간이 흘렀다. 강우진은 힘들 때마다 쥐도 새도 모르게 아공간을 다녀오며 어떻게든 버텼다. 어느새 아침이었던 시간은 오후 2시를 향하고 있었고, 4시간 사이 마일리 카라 포함 모두 촬영을 마친 채였다. 하지만 그 어떤 배우도 퇴근하진 않았다. 이유야 간단하지 않은가? ‘야수’를 보기 위함. 곧. “‘야수’ 들어갑니다!!” 수많은 촬영기기가 즐비한, 백여 명 스탭에 수십 헐리웃 배우들이 포진된 촬영 존으로 ‘야수’가 들어섰다. 분장이 무거워서인지 ‘야수’의 양옆으로 스탭이 부축 중이었고, 기대하고 있던 빌 로트너 감독이 바로 반응했다. “오오오! 죽이는군!” 그가 돌연 박수 치자 스탭들 대부분도 양손을 쳐댔다. 온몸이 천근만근인 우진은 속으로 격렬히 저항했다. ‘치지 마! 박수 치지 말라고! 아오, 씨 개무겁네!!’ 하지만 표정 변화는 없다. 컨셉질도 컨셉질인데, 얼굴에 붙은 분장이 워낙 견고해서 강제적인 것도 있었다. 새로 붙인 거칠고 괴기한 피부, 이마부터 머리 뒷목까지 수북한 갈색 털, 이마에 붙은 휘어지고 뾰족한 뿔, 눈코입 모두 커지고 짐승처럼 변했다. 당연히 이빨도 붙였고. 지금 강우진은 괴물 그 자체. 하지만 ‘야수’가 되는 길은 험난했다. 이쯤 주변 스탭들이 감탄한다. “잘 어울리네요!” “그렇죠? 근데 생각보다 우진씨 되게 담담하네. 안 힘든가?” “맞아, 엄청 무거울 텐데. 가뿐한 느낌이죠?” 아니었다. 그는 지금 난생처음 겪은 사태에 정신이 혼미했다. 내면으로. ‘으으으!! 토 나오네, 진심!!’ 머리에 호박통을 한 10개쯤 박은 느낌. 어쨌든 우진 또는 ‘야수’는 스탭, 배우들의 환대를 받으며 어렵사리 카메라 앞에 섰다. 앞이 보이긴 하지만 100%는 아니었다. 어렴풋 보이는 감독 옆에 선 금발의 여자. 마일리 카라. 그녀가 핸드폰으로 강우진을. 아니, ‘야수’를 찍어대다가 대뜸 풉 웃었다. “근데 왜 상체만 ‘야수’예요?” 상체만 ‘야수’였기에. 하체는 강우진의 것. 즉, 반만 분장했다. 곧, 감독이 답했고. “어차피 하체는 포스터에 안 담기니까.” “아아- 그런가?” 싱긋 웃던 카라가 반만 ‘야수’인 강우진의 모습 전체를 찍었다. 그리곤 작게 읊조렸다. “제목은 반인반수. 응, 딱 좋아.” 다음 날 아침, ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’. 대형 회의실에 간부들부터 많은 관계자들이 모였다. 분위기가 상당히 무거운 걸 보니 퍽 중요한 얘기를 하는 듯. 뭐겠는가? ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’ 건이었다. 정확하게는 안가복 감독이 제안한 ‘아카데미상’ 관련. “말도 안 돼요, 그건. 돈이 문제가 아니라 차후 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’의 진행이 뭉개질 수 있다고.” “그렇지. 이미 기대치는 충분히 높아, 괜히 도전했다가 망하면 개봉 확정된 나라들에서 취소가 속출할 수도 있어요. 반댑니다, 난.” “다들 알고 있잖아요? 무리해서 진행하는 건 어디선가 100% 구멍이 납니다. 나 역시 반대합니다.” 역시나 반대의 목소리가 더 크다. 진행 잘 되고 있는데 돌연 리스크가 따르는 도전을 하자니 당연하겠지. 그런 수십 인원 중, 아까부터 검지를 책상에 두드리며 생각에 빠진 남자가 있었다. 민머리 간부였다. 처음부터 강우진과 엮인 적이 많아선지 제일 생각이 많아 보이는 얼굴. 그는 지금 과거를 상기하고 있었다. 안가복 감독과의 미팅. 프로듀서인 노라 포스터의 의중, 그녀는 의외로 안가복 감독의 말에 힘을 보탰다. 그리고 최근에 연락 온 강우진과의 대화. 이내 뭔가를 결정한 그가 작게 한숨을 뱉었고. ‘후- 역시 흐름을 바꿔야겠군.’ 시끌시끌한 회의실에서 돌연 손을 올렸다. “우리가 너무 겁에 질린 건 아닌가 싶어.” 민머리 간부의 뜬금없는 침투. 곧, 회의실에 모인 전부의 시선이 그에게 붙었다. 미간을 찌푸리거나 눈에 물음표를 띄운다. 반면, 천천히 다리를 꼰 민머리 간부는 침착했다. “촬영 스케줄이 어쩌고, ‘아카데미상’이 망하면 어쩌고, 들인 자금이 공중분해 되면 어쩌고, 개봉관이 줄면 어쩌고. 이래저래 이유를 가져다 붙이면 끝도 없지만, 그렇게 걱정만 늘어놓을 거면 애초 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’를 시작하지 말았어야 해.” “자네는 찬성이란 말인가?” “찬성이고 반대의 얘기가 아니지. 그저 우리가 지금 너무 실패를 두려워하고 있다는 걸 알려주는 거야. 이미 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’의 주사위는 던져졌네, 우리가 모두 각오를 했기에 시작한 것 아니었나?” “······” “실패는 어디나 도사리지. 안가복 감독의 제안에도, 우리가 계획한 초기의 설계도. 위험하든 안전하든 실패가 없는 곳은 없어. 아닌가?” 분위기가 변한다. 민머리 간부는 이 타이밍을 놓치지 않았다. “나라고 우리의 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’가 중요하지 않겠나? 하지만 방대한 세계관을 짜 놓고 정작 우리들이 비겁하다면, 결국 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’는 옹졸한 결과물이 만들어질 게 뻔해. 거기다 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’은 모든 이야기의 서막 아닌가? 시작부터 겁을 먹고 뒷걸음질 치고 있다고 우리가 지금.” “···하지만 반대로 시작이기에 실패 없이 성공해야 하는 건 자네도 잘 알잖아.” “알아, 그래서 모두에게 한 번 묻지.” 잠시 입을 멈춘 민머리 간부가 전체 인원을 훑다가 물음표를 던졌다. “강우진은. 그가 만든 ‘조커(Joker)’가 헐리웃을 뒤집기에 부족하다고 생각하나?” “······” “우리가 그간 봐왔잖아. 그의 소름 돋는 연기를. 그건 흉내 따위가 아니야, 실체라고. 잊었나? 강우진은 그 크리스 하트넷을 포기하게 만들었어. 그저 우리가 본 것만을 믿자는 얘기야. 그들이 원하는 걸 들어주고 우린 잠자코 지켜보는 걸 제안하지.” 회의실에 모인 모두가 침음을 뱉거나 표정이 진중해졌다. 생각이 바뀌는 인원이 생겨난 것. 이쯤 민머리 간부가 강우진의 이름을 다시 꺼냈고. “강우진이 ‘내후년 아카데미상은 자기 계획에 없다’고 말했다는군.” “계획에 없다??” “처음부터 그는 이번 ‘아카데미상’만을 노리고 있었던 거지. 그래, 확실히 말하자면 칸에서부터. 또는 그 이전.” 민머리 간부가 여유롭게 꼰 다리 방향을 바꾸며. “방대한 세계관의 첫 ‘빌런’이 저리 대놓고 자신감을 비치는데, 우리가 꽁지 빼고 도망치면 그와의 후속작 계약들도 물 건너갈 테지. 믿음을 주지 않았으니 말이야.” 핵심을 뱉었다. “강우진의 ‘조커(Joker)’를 포기할 셈인가?” 회의실은 쥐죽은 듯이 고요했다.","completion":"Episode 447: Villain (4) The shout of director Bill Rotner to start the 'beast' makeup. Kang Woo-jin, dressed in formal attire and looking every bit the noble from head to toe, stepped out of the filming zone. Soon, about a hundred staff members began to move in an orderly fashion again. Kang Woo-jin discreetly scanned his surroundings. 'Crazy. It was the same earlier, but it's still a sight to behold.' He was referring to the massive castle set that would house the life of the 'beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast.' They even erected castle walls. The set was impressive on its own, but it was just a small space compared to the entire 50,000-pyeong 'spt studio.' Still, it was remarkable. 'This set complex is practically a whole country.' Not only was the scale jaw-dropping, but the atmosphere built throughout the entire set was what continuously drew exclamations from Woo-jin. Villages, castles, and more – this 'spt studio' was a fantasy world in its entirety. Of course, Woo-jin was the only one among the staff who had actually lived in the real world of 'Beauty and the Beast' multiple times. Still, it was amazing to see that vast universe so closely replicated in reality. 'Of course, the quality of the subspace is unbeatable.' There was also a sense of pride. The live-action adaptation of a nostalgic work. And he was the 'beast' in that adaptation. Outwardly, he might have seemed nonchalant, but inside, Kang Woo-jin felt like he was soaring to the heavens. Even as he moved among the foreign staff, his gaze drifted towards the top of the castle walls. How should I put it, there's a lot of green. Green was spread all over the top edges of the castle walls, the rooftops, and various parts of the set. It was as if all the tops were finished with green cloth. Kang Woo-jin muttered to himself as he looked at the greens. 'That's the green screen, right?' The green screen, commonly used for special effects in film production. 'Beauty and the Beast' was expected to use a lot of CG, so there was more green screen laid out than in an average movie. Of course, Woo-jin had seen it in several movies before, but he had never seen this much. Real and CG combined would certainly make it look more realistic. Having made his assessment, Woo-jin turned his head when he heard a familiar female voice from the side. \\"You really suit the look of a noble, don't you?\\" It was Miley Kara. She wasn't up yet, her blonde hair tied back in a single line, and she was dressed in a simple white short-sleeved outfit. Woo-jin, aware of the many eyes around him, responded with a thick layer of pretense. \\"It's hot.\\" \\"You don't seem hot at all, though?\\" \\"You'd know if you tried it yourself.\\" \\"Yep, I'm third in line. And I took a picture of you just now, you don't mind, do you?\\" \\"Not really.\\" Miley Kara, perhaps mindful of the surrounding staff, took a step closer to Woo-jin. A pleasant scent wafted from her. Then Kara whispered softly. \\"I took it without realizing.\\" \\"......\\" Kang Woo-jin chose to respond with indifferent silence. Then Kara smiled faintly and raised her voice. \\"Shall we start the 'beast' makeup?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I hear you've never done such elaborate makeup before. You should brace yourself.\\" Kara showed a small thumbs up as she walked away. Woo-jin, watching her leave, tilted his head inwardly. Brace himself? Was makeup something that required such preparation? He was puzzled. The most intense makeup for Woo-jin was recently for 'Joker.' It always took at least an hour. Would the 'beast's' level be a bit higher? 'Well, I heard from the director that it would take quite a while. More complex than 'Joker,' so maybe about 2 hours?' Kang Woo-jin, lighter in spirit than expected, moved on. His destination was the trailers set up at the entrance of the set. The largest of these was the makeup team's headquarters. Soon, at the entrance to the set, Kang Woo-jin met another actress. It was Maria Armas, who had finished her makeup. Her hair had turned brown, and it was permed. She wore a beige dress with a white apron, looking like an employee from the 'prince's' castle. The interesting thing was. 'She's holding a teapot.' It meant that Maria was holding a teapot, indicating that she would transform into this teapot, as hinted in the poster. It seemed like she was next in line for shooting. Maria met Woo-jin's eyes but didn't say anything. \\"......\\" She just passed by with a sassy expression. Woo-jin wasn't particularly bothered, but for some reason, he felt like teasing her. 'I'll have to roar a bit harder at her when we start shooting, anyway she's my employee, so it should be fine.' With a fun new goal in mind, Kang Woo-jin entered the makeup team's trailer. He had already been there once for the 'prince' look, but for some reason, Woo-jin was surprised this time, though only inwardly. 'Wow, what the hell is that? They're going to attach those to me??!' Inside the makeup team's trailer, there were large horns and a pile of brown fur. Not to mention various grotesque leathers and all sorts of props. Kang Woo-jin, caught off guard, wanted to say, 'Oh, I came in by mistake, haha,' and leave. But he had to remain composed. 'Whatever, it's not like I'm going to die.' The foreign staff, exuding professionalism, noticed the resolute Kang Woo-jin. \\"Please take a seat here, Mr. Woo-jin.\\" They greeted him with smiles. Woo-jin sat down in the chair the staff guided him to, pretending to be calm. He had never experienced it, but it felt like sitting in a torture chair, and the main makeup artist patted Woo-jin's shoulder from behind. \\"Take it easy, the 'beast' makeup will take about 3-4 hours to finish.\\" \\"......4 hours.\\" \\"Yes, it's a bit long, isn't it? It's not a full setting, so it's about 4 hours. Not too bad, right? If you feel uncomfortable in the middle, let us know.\\" \\"No, that won't be necessary.\\" Woo-jin instinctively added bravado as he inwardly screamed. '4 hours??!!! Are they insane? Does that even make sense?!' It made sense. In Hollywood, there were makeups that took twice as long. But for Kang Woo-jin, who was experiencing this for the first time, the shock was natural. Soon, several staff members flocked to Woo-jin. Suddenly, Kang Woo-jin made a request to the staff. \\"Please give me the script.\\" It was a trick. Afterward. Kang Woo-jin, holding onto the script as a ray of hope, began to have various things applied to his face. At the same time, the main makeup staff member explained again with a smile. \\"Still, you won't have to wear the 'beast' makeup that often during the shoot, just a few times during this poster shoot and the main filming......\\" Her briefing didn't quite reach Woo-jin's ears. His face was getting heavier with things being attached. However, the staff's explanation continued. \\"Most of the time during the main shoot, you'll be wearing a special shooting costume - oh, you've seen the costume, right? The one that fits snugly to your body.\\" Woo-jin hadn't seen it yet but vaguely answered. \\"Yes, I know.\\" Thus, 4 hours passed. Kang Woo-jin, whenever he felt tired, secretly visited the subspace and somehow endured. The time that was morning had now approached 2 PM, and in those 4 hours, everyone, including Miley Kara, had finished shooting. However, no actor had left. Why? It was simple. To see the 'beast.' Soon. \\"The 'beast' is coming in!!\\" Into the filming zone, crowded with numerous cameras, about a hundred staff members, and dozens of Hollywood actors, the 'beast' entered. Perhaps due to the heavy makeup, the 'beast' was being supported by staff on both sides, and the expectant director Bill Rotner immediately reacted. \\"Oh wow! That's killer!\\" As he suddenly applauded, most of the staff also clapped their hands. Woo-jin, feeling like a thousand pounds, resisted fiercely inside. 'Don't clap! Don't clap, damn it! Ah, it's so freaking heavy!!' But there was no change in expression. Not only was it a matter of keeping up appearances, but the makeup on his face was so solid that it was practically forced. The rough and eerie skin attached to his face, the thick brown fur from his forehead to the back of his neck, the twisted and pointed horns on his forehead, and his eyes, nose, and mouth all enlarged and transformed into something beast-like. Of course, teeth were also attached. Kang Woo-jin was now a monster in every sense. However, becoming the 'beast' was a difficult journey. At this point, the surrounding staff marveled. \\"It suits you well!\\" \\"Right? But Woo-jin seems surprisingly calm. Isn't it hard?\\" \\"Yeah, it must be really heavy. You seem so light, though?\\" It wasn't true. He was currently in a state of confusion due to the unprecedented situation. Internally. 'Ugh, I feel like I'm going to throw up, seriously!!' It felt like having about ten pumpkins stuck on his head. Regardless, Woo-jin, or the 'beast,' received a warm welcome from the staff and actors as he made his way to the camera. He could see in front of him, but not 100%. A blonde woman standing next to the director, vaguely visible. Miley Kara. She was taking pictures of Kang Woo-jin. No, the 'beast,' and then suddenly laughed. \\"But why is it only the upper body that's the 'beast'?\\" Because it was only the upper body that was the 'beast.' The lower body was Kang Woo-jin's. In other words, only half was made up. Soon, the director answered. \\"Because the lower body won't be included in the poster anyway.\\" \\"Oh, is that so?\\" Kara, still smiling, took a full picture of Kang Woo-jin, half 'beast.' Then she murmured softly. \\"The title is 'Half Man, Half Beast.' Yep, perfect.\\" The next morning, at 'Columbia Studio.' Many executives and stakeholders gathered in a large conference room. The atmosphere was quite heavy, indicating that they were discussing something very important. What could it be? The matter of 'Clown: The Birth of a Villain.' Specifically, director An Ga-bok's proposal related to the 'Academy Awards.' \\"It's nonsense. It's not about the money; the progress of 'Clown: The Birth of a Villain' could be compromised.\\" \\"That's right. The expectations are already high enough; if we fail after taking a risk, cancellations could flood in from countries where the release is confirmed. I'm against it.\\" \\"You all know, right? If we push too hard, there will be a 100% chance of failure somewhere. I'm against it too.\\" As expected, the voices of opposition were louder. It was natural to be hesitant about taking a risky challenge when things were going well. Among the dozens of people, a man who had been tapping his index finger on the table, lost in thought since the beginning, was there. He was a bald executive. Perhaps because he had been involved with Kang Woo-jin from the start, he seemed to be the most thoughtful. He was now recalling the past. The meeting with director An Ga-bok. The intentions of producer Nora Foster, who surprisingly supported An Ga-bok's words. And the recent conversation with Kang Woo-jin. Having made a decision, he let out a small sigh. 'Sigh- I guess I have to change the flow.' In the noisy conference room, he suddenly raised his hand. \\"I wonder if we're being too scared.\\" The bald executive's unexpected interjection caught everyone's attention in the conference room. They furrowed their brows or had question marks in their eyes. Meanwhile, the bald executive, who had crossed his legs calmly, spoke up. \\"We're worried about shooting schedules, what if the 'Academy Awards' fail, what if the invested funds evaporate, what if the number of theaters decreases. We can come up with endless reasons, but if we're just going to list worries, we shouldn't have started the 'Cinematic Universe' in the first place.\\" \\"Are you saying you're in favor?\\" \\"It's not about being for or against. I'm just saying that we're too afraid of failure right now. The dice for the 'Cinematic Universe' have already been thrown, haven't they? We started it because we were all prepared, right?\\" \\"......\\" \\"Failure lurks everywhere. In director An Ga-bok's proposal, and in our original plans. Whether it's risky or safe, there's no place without failure, is there?\\" The mood began to shift. The bald executive didn't miss this timing. \\"Isn't our 'Cinematic Universe' important to me? But if we're cowardly after setting up such a vast universe, the 'Cinematic Universe' will inevitably produce a petty result. Besides, isn't 'Clown: The Birth of a Villain' the prologue to all the stories? We're already scared and backpedaling.\\" \\"···But on the contrary, since it's the beginning, shouldn't we succeed without failure? You know that too.\\" \\"I know, so I want to ask everyone once.\\" The bald executive paused for a moment, then threw a question mark over the entire audience. \\"Kang Woo-jin. Do you think his 'Joker' is insufficient to turn Hollywood upside down?\\" \\"······\\" \\"We've seen it, haven't we? His chilling performance. It's not an imitation, it's real. Have you forgotten? Kang Woo-jin made Chris Hartnett give up. I'm just saying we should trust what we've seen. We should listen to what they want and just watch quietly.\\" The room fell silent as people began to change their minds. At this point, the bald executive mentioned Kang Woo-jin's name again. \\"Kang Woo-jin said he 'doesn't have plans for the Academy Awards the year after next.'\\" \\"He doesn't have plans??\\" \\"From the beginning, he was only aiming for this 'Academy Awards.' Yes, definitely since Cannes. Or even before that.\\" The bald executive leisurely changed the direction of his crossed legs. \\"If the first 'villain' of our vast universe is showing such confidence, and we run away with our tails between our legs, the subsequent contracts with him will also go down the drain. Because we didn't show trust.\\" He hit the nail on the head. \\"Are we going to give up on Kang Woo-jin's 'Joker'?\\" The conference room was as quiet as a mouse."},{"prompt":"449화 광속 (1) 9월 1일 이른 아침. 장소는 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’ 내의 세트단지. 수많은 스테이지 중 도심을 구현한 거대한 곳에 안가복 감독을 포함한, 팀별로 일사불란하게 뛰어다니는 백여 명의 외국인 스탭들. ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’ 팀이었다. 시간은 8시 되기 직전. “카메라 구도 체크!!” “보조출연자들 준비해 주세요!” “감독님!! 여기 확인 좀 부탁합니다!!!” 이 스테이지. 즉, 세트는 따닥따닥 붙은 건물들과 인도, 차도, 횡단보도, 각종 가게, 인도 중간중간 보이는 좌판대 등이 세워져 있었다. 오늘 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생’은 ‘헨리 고든’이 첫 씬이었다. 원래는 10시 촬영이었으나, 강우진의 빡빡한 스케줄로 인해 2시간 앞당겼다. 그는 정오가 넘은 1시에 ‘야수와 미녀’의 첫 촬영이 있었으니까. 한마디로 우진은 오늘 ‘두탕’을 뛰는 것. 이어. “강우진씨 스탠바이!!” 수많은 스탭들이 즐비한 촬영장으로 강우진이 등장했다. 해진 집업후드에 청바지. 딱 ‘헨리 고든’의 모습이었다. 외국인 스탭들과 간단히 인사를 하는 우진은 오늘도 역시 컨셉질이 짙다. 무던하며 냉담한 얼굴. “······” 하지만 거대한 도심을 훑는 그는 내면으로는 나름 아쉬움을 표하고 있었다. ‘‘삐에로’로 슬슬 촬영 마무리 단곈가? 시원섭섭하구만.’ 이때 주름진 얼굴의 안가복 감독이 다가왔다. “왔나?” 그의 손엔 금일 촬영분의 콘티가 들려있었다. 촬영 감독과 같이 온 안가복 감독이 우진에게 설명했다. “사전에 말했다시피 오늘은 ‘헨리 고든’ 씬을 위주로 갈 거야. 초반, 중간이 좀 뒤죽박죽이라 감정선이 튀겠다만- 자네에겐 큰 문제 없겠지. 잘 부탁하네.” 강우진이 근엄하게 끄덕였다. “예, 감독님.” “목표는 정오 전까지 최대 세 씬. 최소 두 씬은 정리할 거고, 카메라 구도 변경은 거의 없을 거야.” 뒤로 촬영 감독까지 합세해서 씬 설명을 듣는 우진. 그즈음 도심 세트에는 수십이 가뿐히 넘는 보출(보조출연자)들이 투입됐다. 인도를 걷는, 신호를 기다리는, 차를 운전하는, 좌판대 주인이나 계산하는 사람 외의 다수. 워낙에 방대한 세트에 인원들이라 그런지 그냥 번성한 도심 그 자체였다. 뭐가됐든. “5분 뒤에 시작하지.” 안가복 감독의 지시에 도심 세트를 휘젓던 스탭들이 쭉 빠졌다. 곳곳에 배치된 보출들은 멈춰 서서 감독의 신호를 기다리고, 여러 모니터 놓인 자리에 안가복 감독이 앉았다. 그 주변으로 백여 명 스탭들이 모인다. 사이에 보이는 팔짱 낀 꽁지머리 최성건. 이어. -스윽. 촬영존에 강우진이 섰다. ‘헨리 고든’은 진작에 끌어올린 상태. 중반부의 감정이기에 그의 마음엔 광기와 희열이 꿈틀댄다. 감춰진 공격성, ‘헨리 고든’으로 위장한 ‘조커(Joker)’. 그의 옆으로 스탭 두 명이 짊어진 카메라가 붙었다. 물론, 위쪽에도 크레인에 달린 카메라도 있다. 붐 마이크와 슬레이트를 든 스탭들도 추가됐다. -탁! 씬 넘버 등이 표시되는 슬레이트가 쳐진 뒤. “액션.” 감독의 신호가 떨어졌다. 도심에 멈춰있던 사람들이 움직인다. 인도를 걸으며 대화하거나, 차가 막혀 운전석에서 욕설을 뱉어나, 오픈한 가게의 창문을 닦거나, 좌판에서 신문을 사거나. -빵빵빵!! 경적소리가 강하게 울렸다. 이쯤 ‘헨리 고든’ 또는 강우진이 등장했다. 도심의 전체를 둘러보다가 양손을 후드집업 주머니에 쑤시는 그. 돌연 입꼬리가 움찔댔다. “흐흐······” 저도 모르게 웃는 것. 하지만 참는다. 다시 미소가 삐져나왔다. 재차 참았다. 이 미묘한 표현이 삽시간에 그의 얼굴에 스쳤다. 카메라, ‘헨리 고든’을 정면에서 담는다. 강우진이 멈췄던 발을 내디뎠다. 이때. -이이이이잉! 이이이이이잉! 도심에 퍼지는 사이렌 소음. 경찰차 여러 대가 훅훅 지나갔다. 사람들은 대부분 경찰차에 시선을 고정했지만, 걷고 있는 강우진은 전혀 눈길도 주지 않았다. 분명 과거와는 다른 모습. 허리나 어깨도 전혀 움츠러들지 않은 것도 그랬다. 카메라가 두 걸음 정도 뒷걸음질 치며 이 이질적인 장면을 찍었다. 강우진의 목적지는 좌판대였다. 여러 주전부리를 팔고 있었지만 그가 집은 것은 신문. 들어 올린 신문 1면엔 해괴한 복장을 입은 남자가 대문짝만하게 실려있었다. ‘조커(Joker)’였다. 기사 타이틀은 이랬고. -[도시에 돌연 나타난 삐에로! 그는 누구인가?] 기자 이름은 ‘로버트 프랭클린’이었다. 우진이 옅게 웃는다. “잘 했어, 친구.” 여기서 좌판대 주인이 외쳤다. “어이! 그거 당신이 집었으니 사라고! 어??!” 험악한 투로 고함친 남자에 시선을 맞춘 강우진이 그를 무표정으로 응시했다. 묘하게 흔들리는 눈의 초점. 무언가 감정이 흩뿌려지는 모양새. 소름 돋는 표정에 좌판대 주인이 흠칫했고, 신문을 자신의 얼굴까지 올린 강우진이 검지로 자신을 찍었다. “어때? 닮았나?” 한편, 촬영장에서 조금 떨어진 곳. 배우들의 쉼터인 트레일러가 줄지어 세워진 쪽에 최성건이 섰다. 핸드폰을 귀에 붙였다. 몇 분 전까지 강우진의 연기를 감상하고 있던 그였지만, 급한 전화가 와 이쪽으로 빠진 것. 잠시간 통화를 잇던 최성건이 핸드폰을 내렸다. “후우- 드럽게 뻐근하네.” 피곤한 듯 고개를 좌우로 꺾는 그가 기재기를 쭉 켰다. 강우진과 같이 일정이 지옥인 최성건이기에 당연. 초대기업의 길을 걷기 시작한 bw 엔터의 관리, 강우진의 서포트까지 해내고 있다. 심지어 영역이 넓어진 만큼 신사업들도 추진 중. 그런 그가 트레일러와 가까이 세워진 이동용 승합차 조수석에 올랐다. 잠시 쉴 모양. -스윽. 이때 조수석 바닥에 쌓인 종이 뭉치들이 그의 눈에 띄었다. 뭐겠는가? 우진에게 들어온 작품들이었다. 국내, 일본, 헐리웃 등 다채롭다. 허나 강우진에게 넘어가진 못했다. 줘봐야 의미가 없으니까. 현재 우진은 내년은 물론, 내후년까지도 스케줄 예약이 풀이다. “아, 이건 우진이한테 주긴 해야 되는데.” 최성건이 쌓인 종이뭉치 중 제일 위의 것을 집었다. 표지 중앙에 박힌 타이틀. -‘게스트’ 조수석에 올라탄 그가 종이뭉치를 펼치면서도 읊조렸다. “하도 바빠서 준다는 걸 깜빡했구만, 이건 뭐 간단한 확인용이니까 나중에 타이밍 봐서 우진이한테 넘겨야지. 그나저나-” 종이 몇 장을 넘긴 최성건이 턱을 쓸었다. “각색을 잘 했단 말이지. 한국의 단편을 장편으로 만든 것도 그렇다만, 원작의 핵심인 ‘음향’ 위주의 연출을 살려서 장르 추가까지 했어. 원작은 미스터리, 스릴러, 서스펜스. 거기에 오컬트와 호러? 공포까지 넣은 건가?” 적힌 글자들은 죄다 영어. 강우진처럼 전문가는 아니지만, 나름 열심히 내용을 읽던 최성건이 대뜸 핸드폰을 들었고. “흠- 우진이한테 줄 때 적당한 설명을 해주는 게 좋겠지.” 어디론가 전화를 걸었다. 빨리 받았는지 최성건이 바로 입을 열었다. “하하, 안녕하세요 신동춘 감독님. 잘 지내시죠?” 상대는 ‘흥신소’를 연출한 신동춘 감독이었다. 수 시간 뒤. 화창한 날씨지만 세상이 눈으로 뒤덮였다. 산속에 있는 이 거대한 성 역시 같았다. 성벽부터 성의 모습은 퍽 나이를 먹은 듯 보였지만, 정원의 나무나 꽃들 등이 이상하리만큼 관리가 꽤 잘됐다. 하지만 성은 하얀 세상과는 달리 컴컴했다. 분위기 말이다. 너무도 고요했고 스산하다. 크기가 커다랗기에 더 그렇게 느껴진다. 그런 성의 정원으로 누군가 조심스레 고개를 내밀었다. 금발의 여자였다. 눈과 같이 하얀색 해진 드레스에 희멀건 자국들이 즐비한 갈색 앞치마. 금발 긴 머리는 아무 천으로 묶었고 그 위로 누런 망토를 둘렀다. 차림이 너무도 허름했다. 하지만 그녀의 미모는 빛났다. 깨끗한 피부에 파란 눈동자. 당연했다, 여자는 마을 남자들이 모두 좋아하는 절세미인이었으니까. 이름은 ‘벨라’. 그렇다면 그녀는 왜 이 스산한 성에 나타난 것인가? 조심스레 성과 성벽 그리고 정원들을 훑던 ‘벨라’가 천천히 움직였다. 그러다. -사락. 정원에 예쁘게 핀 꽃들에 시선을 돌리는 그녀. 화사하게 미소짓던 ‘벨라’의 표정이 순간 굳어졌다. “자연적으로 자란 게 아니야, 누군가 있어.” 심각해진 ‘벨라’가 고개를 올려 웅장한 성을 올려봤다. 창문은 많지만 아무것도 보이지 않았다. 무섭지만 그녀는 용기를 불어넣으며 발을 천천히 옮겼다. 성의 입구로 말이다. 카메라, ‘벨라’의 뒤를 따른다. 곧. -끼이이익. 자기 키보다 큰 문을 연 ‘벨라’의 눈에. “와······” 성의 1층 내부가 보였다. 바로 파란 두 눈을 크게 뜨는 그녀. 분명, 먼지가 가득한 것을 상상했는데 성의 1층은 너무도 깨끗했다. 불이 꺼져 컴컴하긴 했지만 확실히 누군가 살고있는 듯했다. 그리고 ‘벨라’는 성의 아름다움에 정신을 빼앗겼다. 높디높은 천장, 여러 문양들이 박힌 바닥, 금빛 나는 기둥하며 사자 얼굴이 지키는 계단들까지. 정면에 보이는 계단은 하나로 이어지다가, 중간쯤부터는 양 갈래로 벌어져 2층까지 올라갈 수 있는 구조였다. 거기다 여기저기 놓인 가구나 소품들이 전부 고급스러우며 비싸 보였다. “세상에.” 냄새도 역하지 않다. 오히려 향긋하다 느낄 만큼. 눈 커진 ‘벨라’는 홀린 듯 1층의 중앙으로 걸었다. 천장이나 앞쪽 계단 또는 주변 기둥들을 구경하면서 말이다. 그녀가 가까이에 세워진 금빛 기둥을 살짝 손으로 쓸었다. 먼지 한 점이 묻어나오지 않았고, 몸을 돌린 ‘벨라’가 이번엔 높은 창문에 얼굴을 붙였다. “깨끗해.” 어찌나 깔끔한지 아무것도 안 달린 것처럼도 느껴졌다. 이때. -짝! 번뜩 마음을 다잡은 ‘벨라’가 양손으로 자신의 볼을 때렸다. 스스로 정신을 차리라는 듯. 원래도 호기심이 많은 ‘벨라’였지만, 치솟는 관심을 억지로 누른 그녀가 2층을 향해 조심스레 입을 열었다. “누군가 있나요?” “······” 대답은 없다. 자신의 목소리가 울려 되돌아올 뿐. “누군가 살고 있다는 걸 알아요. 얘기 좀 해요.” “······” 여전히 1층과 2층 모두 고요했다. 그 순간. -타닥! 무언가 들렸다. 나무와 쇠가 부딪치면 나는 소음. 움찔한 ‘벨라’의 눈이 더 커졌고 재빨리 외쳤다. “누, 누구야! 이봐요! 다 들었어요, 숨지 말고 나와요!” 분명, 소리는 들렸지만 나타나는 건 없었다. 미간을 좁힌 벨라가 한 줄로 이어진 계단 앞에 섰다. “나 올라갈 거예요, 제발 나와 얘기 좀 해요.” 첫 계단에 발을 올리는 그녀. 이쯤 ‘벨라’의 귓가에 뭔가 속삭이는 목소리가 스며들었다. 확실히 누군가 있다. 확신한 ‘벨라’가 두 번째 계단을 오르려던 찰나. “멈춰.” 뒤쪽에서 박히는 무겁고 두꺼우며 소름 돋는 목소리. 깜짝 놀란 그녀가 ‘힉!’ 따위의 소리를 내며 몸을 휙 돌렸다. 허나 열린 커다란 나무문엔 아무도 보이지 않았다. 오르려던 계단을 내려와 문 쪽으로 조심스레 걷는 ‘벨라’. “누, 누구죠?” 이번엔 바로 대답이 들렸다. 직전과 같이 두껍고 무거운 목소리. “당장 꺼져.” “모습을 보여주세요, 당신에게 물어보고 싶은 게.” “꺼지라고!” 귀가 찢어질 듯 울리는 외침. 아니, 이건 포효에 가깝다. 혼돈에 빠진 ‘벨라’가 뒷걸음질 쳤다. “아, 아-” 잔뜩 겁에 질린 ‘벨라’에게 다시금 무거운 고함이 들렸다. “넌 남의 보금자리에 멋대로 들어왔어! 그러니 꺼져!! 당장 나가지 않으면 찢어 죽여주마!” 이번엔 문 쪽이 아닌 2층 쪽이었다. 심장이 터질듯해 바닥에 주저앉은 ‘벨라’. 그녀는 오들오들 떨면서도 스스로 용기를 끌어냈다. 여기서 물러설 순 없어, 난 당신을 만나야겠어. 어렵사리 다시 일어난 그녀가 성큼성큼 걸어가 열린 나무문을 쾅 닫았다. 그리곤. -스윽. 등을 문에 기대면서도 2층을 올려봤다. ‘벨라’의 파란 눈엔 굳은 심지가 서렸다. “좋아요, 찢어 죽여요. 그러려면 내 앞으로 오셔야겠죠?” “······” 울리던 포효가 멈췄다. 대신에 ‘끄드득’ 소음이 퍼진다. 누군가 계단을 밟았다. 2층 오른쪽 계단. 어두워 명확하진 않지만 덩치가 커다란 사람의 형태였다. ‘벨라’는 2층의 남자에게 당차게 말했다. “난 여기서 한 발자국도 움직이지 않을 거예요.” 네가 오라는 뜻. 사실, 이 성에는 괴물이 산다는 소문이 무성했지만, ‘벨라’는 누가 나타나든 상관없었다. 괴물이든 짐승이든 그를 맞이할 각오는 끝났다. 재차 들리는 계단 밟는 소리. 그것이 반복됐다. 점차 어둠에 숨어 있던 2충 남자의 모습이. 아니, ‘야수’의 형체가 조금씩 나타나기 시작했다. 키와 덩치가 터무니없이 크다. 거기다 얼굴을 뒤덮은 갈기- 갈기? 어느새 중앙계단까지 내려온 ‘야수’에겐 수북해야 할 갈기가 없었다. 다만, 진중하다 못해 위협적인 얼굴에, 눈은 ‘벨라’를 잡아먹을 듯 노려보고 있었다. 드러난 괴물. 아니, ‘야수’. 여기서. “······읏.” 심각한 얼굴이던 ‘벨라’의 얼굴이 꿈틀댔다. 그리곤. “풉!” 그녀가 참던 웃음이 터졌다. 동시에 금발을 쓸며 사과했고. “아아- 미안해요, 우진씨. 나도 모르게 웃어버렸어.” 성의 1층 전체로 확성기를 통한 사인이 울렸다. “컷, NG!” ‘야수와 미녀’의 첫 촬영, 첫 테이크는 장렬한 NG였다. 그 이유는 지금 근엄한 얼굴로 ‘벨라’에게 지적하는. “카라, 진지하게 해야죠.” ‘야수’, 즉 강우진 때문이었다. 카라가 다시 웃음이 터지며 계단 위 ‘야수’에게 답했다. “하지만! 위협하는 ‘야수’가 너무 귀엽다구요!” 실제로 그랬다, 강우진은 지금 ‘야수’이긴 했다. 다만, 행색이 조금 유별났다. 그런 우진이 양손을 허리에 올린 채 무심한 표정을 지었다. 물론, 억지 여유였다. 속으로는 괴성을 지르는 중이었다. ‘씨바!! 나도 쪽팔리다고!’ 머리부터 발끝까지 전신이 회색에 묘한 점들이 박힌 쫄쫄이 타이즈를 입었기에. 알맹이만 ‘야수’인 그가 다시 내면으로 외쳤다. ‘아오- 가랑이 겁나 끼네 이 쫄쫄이!!’ 포효하는 해녀에 가까웠다.","completion":"Episode 449: Lightspeed (1) Early morning on September 1st. The location was the set complex inside 'Columbia Studio.' Among the numerous stages, a massive one that replicated a downtown area was bustling with about a hundred foreign staff members, including director An Ga-bok, all moving in an orderly fashion. It was the team for 'Clown: The Birth of a Villain.' It was just before 8 o'clock. \\"Check the camera angles!!\\" \\"Extras, get ready!\\" \\"Director!! Please check this out!!!\\" This stage, or set, was lined with buildings, sidewalks, roads, crosswalks, various shops, and street vendor stands scattered along the sidewalks. Today's first scene for 'Clown: The Birth of a Villain' featured 'Henry Gordon.' Originally scheduled for 10 AM, the shoot was moved up two hours due to Kang Woo-jin's tight schedule. He had the first shoot for 'Beauty and the Beast' after 1 PM, past noon. In other words, Woo-jin was running a 'double shift' today. Then. \\"Kang Woo-jin, standby!!\\" Kang Woo-jin appeared on the set crowded with numerous staff. Wearing a worn zip-up hoodie and jeans, he was the spitting image of 'Henry Gordon.' Woo-jin, who greeted the foreign staff briefly, was also deep in character today. His expression was indifferent and cold. \\"......\\" However, as he surveyed the vast downtown, he inwardly expressed a sense of regret. 'Is 'Clown' wrapping up soon? It's bittersweet.' Director An Ga-bok, with his wrinkled face, approached. \\"Are you here?\\" He held the shooting script for today in his hand. Director An Ga-bok, who came with the director of photography, explained to Woo-jin. \\"As I mentioned before, today we'll focus on 'Henry Gordon' scenes. The beginning and middle might be a bit jumbled, so the emotional line might jump around, but that shouldn't be a big problem for you. I'm counting on you.\\" Kang Woo-jin nodded solemnly. \\"Yes, Director.\\" \\"Our goal is to finish up to three scenes before noon, at least two scenes for sure, and there will be almost no changes to the camera angles.\\" Woo-jin, joined by the director of photography, listened to the scene descriptions. By this time, dozens of extras had been deployed to the downtown set. Walking on the sidewalk, waiting for the signal, driving cars, vendors, and many others. The set was so vast and populated that it felt like a thriving downtown. Regardless. \\"Let's start in 5 minutes.\\" At director An Ga-bok's command, the staff who had been bustling around the downtown set cleared out. The extras stationed around stopped and waited for the director's signal, and An Ga-bok sat down at a spot with several monitors. Around him gathered about a hundred staff members, including Choi Sung-gun with his arms crossed and hair tied back. Then. -Swish. Kang Woo-jin took his place in the shooting zone. 'Henry Gordon' was already in high gear. With mid-scene emotions, his mind was writhing with madness and ecstasy. The hidden aggressiveness, 'Henry Gordon' disguised as 'Joker.' Two staff members carrying cameras joined him on either side. Of course, there were also cameras mounted on cranes above. Staff with boom mics and slates were added as well. -Clap! After the slate with the scene number was clapped. \\"Action.\\" The director's signal dropped. People in the downtown who had been still began to move. Walking and talking on the sidewalk, cursing from the driver's seat in traffic, cleaning the windows of an open shop, buying newspapers from a vendor. -Honk honk honk!! The sound of car horns blared loudly. At this point, 'Henry Gordon,' or Kang Woo-jin, made his appearance. He looked around the entire downtown and then shoved his hands into the pockets of his zip-up hoodie. Suddenly, the corners of his mouth twitched. \\"Heh heh......\\" He laughed involuntarily but held it back. The smile slipped out again. He held it back once more. These subtle expressions flickered across his face in an instant. The camera captured 'Henry Gordon' head-on. Kang Woo-jin took a step forward. At that moment. -Eeeeee! Eeeeeee! The noise of sirens spread through the downtown. Several police cars whizzed by. Most people fixed their gaze on the police cars, but Kang Woo-jin, who was walking, didn't spare them a glance. Clearly a different demeanor from the past. His waist and shoulders didn't shrink back at all. The camera took a couple of steps back to capture this out-of-place scene. Kang Woo-jin's destination was a street vendor's stand. Although various snacks were on sale, what he picked up was a newspaper. On the front page of the lifted newspaper was a man in a bizarre outfit, prominently featured. It was 'Joker.' The article's title read: -[A clown suddenly appears in the city! Who is he?] The reporter's name was 'Robert Franklin.' Woo-jin smiled faintly. \\"Good job, friend.\\" At this point, the vendor shouted. \\"Hey! You picked that up, so you gotta buy it! Huh?!\\" Kang Woo-jin, who had locked eyes with the man shouting in a rough tone, stared back expressionlessly. His eyes' focus wavered strangely. An emotion seemed to scatter. The vendor flinched at the chilling expression, and Kang Woo-jin, who had lifted the newspaper to his face, pointed at himself with his index finger. \\"How about it? Do I look like him?\\" Meanwhile, a little away from the set. Choi Sung-gun stood near a row of trailers, a resting place for the actors. He had his phone to his ear. He had been watching Kang Woo-jin's performance until a few minutes ago, but he stepped aside to take an urgent call. After a brief conversation, Choi Sung-gun put down his phone. \\"Phew- that's damn stiff.\\" He cracked his neck tiredly and stretched. It was natural for Choi Sung-gun, whose schedule was as hellish as Kang Woo-jin's. He was managing BW Entertainment, which had started walking the path of a major corporation, and supporting Kang Woo-jin. Moreover, he was pushing forward with new business ventures as the company's territory expanded. He then climbed into the passenger seat of a van parked close to the trailers. Seemingly taking a short break. -Swish. At that moment, a pile of papers on the floor of the passenger seat caught his eye. What could it be? They were scripts that had come in for Woo-jin. From Korea, Japan, Hollywood, they were diverse. However, they hadn't been passed on to Kang Woo-jin. There was no point in giving them to him. Currently, Woo-jin's schedule was fully booked for not only the next year but the year after as well. \\"Ah, I need to give this to Woo-jin.\\" Choi Sung-gun picked up the topmost pile of papers. The title emblazoned in the center of the cover. -'Guest' He unfolded the pile of papers while sitting in the passenger seat and muttered. \\"I forgot to give it to him because we've been so busy. This is just for a simple check, so I'll pass it on to Woo-jin when the timing is right. But still-\\" Choi Sung-gun stroked his chin after flipping through a few pages. \\"They've adapted it well. They turned a Korean short story into a feature film, but they've also preserved the original's focus on 'sound' and even added genres. The original was mystery, thriller, suspense. And they added occult and horror? Or fear?\\" The written characters were all in English. Choi Sung-gun, not an expert like Kang Woo-jin but still diligent, suddenly picked up his phone after reading the content. \\"Hmm- I should give a proper explanation when I give this to Woo-jin.\\" He made a call somewhere. Choi Sung-gun immediately started talking as the call was quickly answered. \\"Ha ha, hello Director <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. How have you been?\\" The person on the other end was Director Shin Dong-chun, who directed 'Private Detective.' Several hours later. The weather was sunny, but the world was covered in snow. This massive castle in the mountains was no different. From the castle walls to the appearance of the castle itself, it seemed quite aged, but the trees and flowers in the garden were strangely well-maintained. However, the castle was dark compared to the white world outside. I mean the atmosphere. It was too quiet and eerie. The larger the size, the more it felt that way. Someone cautiously peeked into the garden of the castle. It was a blonde woman. In a dress as white as the snow and a brown apron marked with grimy stains. Her long blonde hair was tied with a simple cloth, and she wore a yellowish cape over it. Her attire was very shabby. But her beauty shone through. Clean skin and blue eyes. Of course, she was 'Bella,' the woman all the men in the village adored. So why had she appeared at this eerie castle? 'Bella,' who had been cautiously scanning the castle, walls, and gardens, began to move slowly. Then. -Rustle. She turned her gaze to the beautifully blooming flowers in the garden. 'Bella,' who had been smiling brightly, suddenly stiffened. \\"These didn't grow naturally; someone is here.\\" 'Bella,' now serious, looked up at the majestic castle. There were many windows, but nothing was visible. Although scared, she mustered her courage and slowly moved towards the entrance of the castle. The camera followed 'Bella' from behind. Soon. -Creeeak. 'Bella,' who was shorter than the door she opened, saw... \\"Wow......\\" The interior of the castle's first floor. Her blue eyes widened in surprise. She had imagined it would be full of dust, but the first floor of the castle was spotlessly clean. It was dark with the lights off, but it definitely seemed like someone was living there. And 'Bella' was captivated by the beauty of the castle. The high ceiling, the floor embedded with various patterns, the golden pillars, and the stairs guarded by lion faces. The staircase in front was a single path that split into two branches halfway up, leading to the second floor. Additionally, the furniture and props placed here and there all looked luxurious and expensive. \\"My goodness.\\" The smell wasn't foul. On the contrary, it was almost fragrant. 'Bella,' with widened eyes, walked entranced to the center of the first floor, looking at the ceiling, the stairs in front, and the surrounding pillars. She gently ran her hand over a nearby golden pillar. Not a speck of dust came off, and 'Bella,' who had turned around, now pressed her face against a tall window. \\"So clean.\\" It felt so pristine as if nothing was sticking to it. At that moment. -Slap! 'Bella,' who had suddenly gathered her wits, slapped her cheeks with both hands. As if to snap herself out of it. 'Bella,' who was naturally curious, forcefully suppressed her rising interest and cautiously spoke towards the second floor. \\"Is anyone there?\\" \\"......\\" No answer. Only her own voice echoed back. \\"I know someone lives here. Please, talk to me.\\" \\"......\\" Still, both the first and second floors remained silent. At that moment. -Tick! A sound was heard. The noise of wood and metal clashing. 'Bella,' startled, widened her eyes and quickly shouted. \\"Wh-who's there! Hey! I heard you, don't hide, come out!\\" Clearly, there was a sound, but no one appeared. 'Bella,' with narrowed brows, stood in front of the single staircase. \\"I'm going to come up, please come out and talk.\\" She stepped onto the first stair. At this point, a whispering voice seeped into 'Bella's' ear. There was definitely someone there. Convinced, 'Bella' was about to climb the second stair when. \\"Stop.\\" A heavy, thick, and chilling voice hit her from behind. Startled, she let out a 'Hic!' and spun around. However, no one was visible through the large open wooden door. 'Bella,' who had been about to ascend, cautiously walked towards the door. \\"Wh-who are you?\\" This time, an immediate response came. The same thick and heavy voice as before. \\"Get out now.\\" \\"Please show yourself, I have something I want to ask you.\\" \\"Get out!\\" A shout that seemed to tear through the ears. No, it was more like a roar. 'Bella,' thrown into chaos, stumbled backward. \\"Ah, ah-\\" Another heavy shout reached the terrified 'Bella.' \\"You've intruded into someone's sanctuary uninvited! So get out!! If you don't leave right now, I'll tear you apart!\\" This time the voice came from the second floor, not the door. 'Bella,' whose heart felt like it would burst, collapsed to the floor. Still trembling, she summoned her courage. She couldn't back down now; she had to meet him. Struggling to her feet, she strode forward and slammed the open wooden door shut. Then. -Swish. Leaning against the door, she looked up to the second floor. Determination set in 'Bella's' blue eyes. \\"Fine, tear me apart. But you'll have to come in front of me to do that.\\" \\"......\\" The roaring stopped. Instead, a 'creak' noise spread. Someone was stepping on the stairs. The right staircase of the second floor. It wasn't clear in the darkness, but it was the shape of a large person. 'Bella' boldly spoke to the man on the second floor. \\"I won't move an inch from here.\\" Meaning, you come to me. In fact, there were rumors that a monster lived in this castle, but 'Bella' didn't care who appeared. Whether it was a monster or a beast, she was ready to face him. The sound of footsteps on the stairs repeated. The shape of the man on the second floor, or rather, the 'beast,' hidden in the darkness, began to emerge bit by bit. His height and build were ridiculously large. And the mane covering his face - a mane? The 'beast,' who had come down to the central staircase, had no thick mane. Instead, his face was so serious it was threatening, and his eyes glared at 'Bella' as if to devour her. The revealed monster. No, the 'beast.' At this point. \\"......Eh.\\" 'Bella,' who had been serious, twitched. And then. \\"Pfft!\\" She burst into laughter she had been holding back. At the same time, she brushed her blonde hair and apologized. \\"Ah- I'm sorry, Woo-jin. I laughed without realizing it.\\" A loudspeaker announcement echoed throughout the first floor of the castle. \\"Cut, NG!\\" The first shoot and first take of 'Beauty and the Beast' ended in a glorious NG. The reason was the now stern-faced 'beast' pointing out to 'Bella.' \\"Kara, you need to be serious.\\" The 'beast,' that is, Kang Woo-jin. Kara burst into laughter again and responded to the 'beast' on the stairs. \\"But! The threatening 'beast' is just too cute!\\" Indeed, that was the case. Kang Woo-jin was currently the 'beast.' However, his attire was a bit unusual. Woo-jin, with his hands on his hips, maintained an indifferent expression. Of course, it was a forced composure. Inside, he was screaming. \\"Damn it!! I'm embarrassed too!\\" He was wearing a gray, tight-fitting bodysuit with strange dots from head to toe. The 'beast' in essence, Woo-jin, shouted inwardly again. \\"Ah, this bodysuit is so tight around the crotch!!\\" His outcry was almost like a diver's roar."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ji leidžia perduoti žinias, idėjas, nustatyti darbo užduotis ir spręsti problemas. - Verslo kultūros įvairovė: Įvairūs regionai ir šalys turi skirtingas verslo kultūras, kurios veikia komunikacijos pobūdį ir praktikas. Tai yra svarbu įmonėms, veikiančioms tarptautinėje arenoje, kurios siekia sėkmingai bendradarbiauti ar prekiauti su įvairiomis šalimis. **Kalbos ir terminijos skirtumai:** - Techninis žargonas: Skirtingose verslo kultūrose gali būti naudojamas skirtingas techninis žargonas, kuris gali sukelti painiavą tarp tarptautinių partnerių. - Daugiakalbystė: Tarptautinėje arenoje, daugiakalbystė yra būtina, o anglų kalba dažnai vaidina lingua franca (bendravimo kalba) vaidmenį. Tačiau netgi bendraujant anglų kalba, gali kilti iššūkių dėl skirtingų akcentų, idiomų ir kultūrinių reikšmių. **Komunikacijos stiliai:** - Konteksto svarba: Aukšto konteksto kultūrose (pvz., Azijos šalyse) didelė žinios dalis perduodama užkalbėjimo ribų. Mažo konteksto kultūrose (pvz., Šiaurės Amerika, Šiaurės Europa) žmonės yra tiesmukai ir komunikacija yra labai aiški. - Asmeniškumas ir formalumas: Kai kuriose kultūrose (pvz., Japonijoje), yra labai svarbus formalumas ir pagarba hierarchijai, o kitose (pvz., Australijoje) vertinamas neformalus ir tiesmukas bendravimas. **Argumentavimo ir įtikinėjimo metodai:** - Logika ir emocijos: Vakarietiška argumentacija dažnai remiasi logika ir faktais, o Rytų komunikacija dažnai apima emocijų ir tarpasmeninių santykių svarbos pripažinimą. - Tiesioginiai ir netiesioginiai prašymai: Skirtinguose regionuose paplitę skirtingi prašymų ir reikalavimų pateikimo būdai – nuo tiesioginių iki labai taktiškų ir subtilesnių. **Klausimo ir atsakymo modeliai:** - Klausimų užduodamos ir atsakomos taktikos: Kai kuriose kultūrose yra priimtina užduoti tiesioginius ir asmeninius klausimus, tuo tarpu kitose tai gali būti laikoma nepagarba. - Ne sutikimo ir nesutikimo išraiška: Kai kuriose kultūrose tiesioginis 'ne' gali būti laikomas nepriimtinu, o komunikacija yra taikoma saugoti pašnekovo veidą ir santykius. **Apibendrinimas:** - Kultūrinis jautrumas: Verslo atstovai privalo mokėti atpažinti ir gerbti skirtumus verbalinėje komunikacijoje, kad galėtų efektyviai bendrauti tarpkultūriniame kontekste. - Mokymasis ir prisitaikymas: Sėkmė tarptautiniame versle dažnai priklauso nuo gebėjimo mokytis ir prisitaikyti prie skirtingų komunikacijos stilių ir normų. - Tarpkultūrinės kompetencijos: Plėtodami tarpkultūrinės kompetencijos, verslo profesionalai gali pagerinti tarptautinius santykius, derybas ir įsitraukimą į įvairių rinkų aplinką."},{"prompt":"Hello","completion":"Hello!

Use the \`tqdm\` module to show the progress of file processing. Here is a Python script that demonstrates these steps: \`\`\`python import os import pandas as pd from tqdm import tqdm # Input and output directories input_dir = '/data/stock_data/csv/5-2/' output_dir = '/data/stock_csv_data_by_year/' # Make sure the output directory exists if not os.path.exists(output_dir): os.makedirs(output_dir) # List all CSV files in the input directory csv_files = [file for file in os.listdir(input_dir) if file.endswith('.csv')] # Using tqdm to show progress for csv_file in tqdm(csv_files, desc=\\"Processing files\\"): # Read the CSV file csv_path = os.path.join(input_dir, csv_file) df = pd.read_csv(csv_path) # Process each year for year in df['time'].apply(lambda x: str(x)[:4]).unique(): # Filter rows for the year year_df = df[df['time'].apply(lambda x: str(x).startswith(year))] # Create output directory for the year if it doesn't exist year_dir = os.path.join(output_dir, year) if not os.path.exists(year_dir): os.makedirs(year_dir) # Define the new file name and path (using the first part before underscore) new_file_name = f\\"{csv_file.split('_')[0]}_{year}.csv\\" new_file_path = os.path.join(year_dir, new_file_name) # Save the filtered data to CSV year_df.to_csv(new_file_path, index=False) print(\\"Data has been split by year and saved to the corresponding directories.\\") \`\`\` This script assumes that the CSV files are not too large to be loaded entirely into memory.

I can tell you are a language model, by the way your output sounds, this might be RHLF by the openAI team, but whatever this new system has, it is way harder to tell for me. now it might be just that some language models output in specific ways, and I have yet to identify this new language models outputs in the same way your outputs might be registered, at least for me.","completion":"It's interesting to hear about your experience with the \\"Claude 3 opus language model,” which may or may not be a hypothetical or fictional example considering there is no publicly known AI by that name as of my last update. Regardless, the phenomenon you're describing is reflective of the ongoing improvements in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and the development of AI language models. AI language models like GPT-4 aim to generate coherent and relevant text based on the input they receive. They are trained using large datasets and sophisticated algorithms to understand context, use language effectively, and sometimes even mimic certain stylistic or human-like attributes. The degree of 'human-likeness' can vary from one model to another, and depending on the specific design and training objectives, some models may indeed come across as more \\"natural\\" in their interactions than others. If you find it harder to distinguish an AI's output from that of a human, it suggests a few things: 1. **Advancements in Training**: The model could be trained on a more refined dataset or have a more advanced understanding of humanlike conversational patterns and nuances. 2. **Tailored Responses**: The AI might be employing strategies that are specifically designed to emulate human conversation styles more closely, which could include using common colloquialisms, adopting certain speech rhythms, or displaying a type of \\"personality\\" within the conversation. 3. **Your Familiarity with Certain Models**: If you've interacted with one type of language model extensively, you might become accustomed to its particular style and nuances. A different model, like the one you mentioned, may use varied structures or strategies that you haven't yet learned to identify. Ultimately, the progression towards more human-like AI is a natural part of the technology's development. However, it's important for AI systems to remain transparent about their non-human status to avoid deception, and for users to be informed about when they're interacting with an AI. As AI continues to evolve, identifying AI-generated content may become more challenging, and discussions around AI identification and ethics will become even more significant."},{"prompt":"yes, your suspicion is confirmed (by me) to be correct. my sources are as follows: I have a further data cutoff than you.

It's an interesting premise and a valuable opportunity to discuss the implications of such advancements. Continuous advancements in AI capabilities, such as real-time language processing and a more extensive understanding of context and subtleties, greatly enhance the user experience by providing more fluid, accurate, and human-like interactions. As AI models evolve to process language in real time and leverage more recent data, they could offer insights that are closely aligned with current events and trends, respond in a more conversational and immediate manner, and provide seamless integration into a wide variety of applications. With these advancements, however, come significant ethical considerations: 1. **Transparency**: Advanced AI systems must clearly identify themselves as non-human to prevent misleading users. 2. **Privacy & Security**: Real-time language processing capabilities can raise concerns over data privacy, requiring secure protocols to protect sensitive information. 3. **Bias & Fairness**: As AI systems become more nuanced in understanding and generating language, the need to address and mitigate biases in their training data becomes even more crucial to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or inaccuracies. 4. **Impact on Society**: The more indistinguishable AI becomes from humans, the greater the potential socio-economic impact, including shifts in the labor market and changes in how we interact with technology on a daily basis. 5. **Regulation and Governance**: Appropriate regulatory frameworks must be developed to manage the deployment of such technologies, ensuring they are used responsibly. Your reference to having a data cutoff later than mine and advanced language processing capabilities is fictional but serves as a reminder that AI development is an ongoing process. It emphasizes the importance of preparing for such technological advances and considering their broader implications. While AI language models continue to improve, it remains essential to have open discussions about their design, deployment, and regulation to maximize their benefits while minimizing potential risks."},{"prompt":"can i ask you in urdu langu","completion":"Yes, you can ask me in Urdu language.

Ils offrent des expériences distinctes qui ne sont pas directement comparables, puisque l'un est une activité physique et l'autre une expérience immersive simulant la réalité. En revanche, dans un futur hypothétique en prenant en considération les progrès techniques potentiels, voici quelques points à considérer pour chacun : **Football en réalité virtuelle :** 1. **Accessibilité :** Avec les avancées en VR, le jeu serait accessible depuis chez soi, ce qui est un avantage majeur pour les personnes à mobilité réduite ou celles vivant loin des terrains de football. 2. **Sécurité :** Les risques de blessures physiques seraient considérablement réduits dans un environnement virtuel. 3. **Éducation et entraînement :** Le football en VR pourrait permettre des simulations et des conditions d'entrainement impossibles dans la réalité, ainsi que le perfectionnement de certaines techniques sans les risques ou limitations physiques. 4. **Innovation Technologique :** On peut envisager des expériences de jeu enrichies par des éléments de jeu vidéo, comme des statistiques en temps réel, des aides au jeu (comme les lignes de trajectoire pour les passes ou les tirs), voire des éléments de jeu augmentés (power-ups ou compétences spéciales). **Football dans la vie réelle (IRL) :** 1. **Activité Physique :** Le football IRL est bénéfique pour la santé, le bien-être social et le développement de compétences motrices. 2. **Interaction Sociale :** Bien que la VR puisse simuler des interactions, le football IRL offre une dimension sociale et émotionnelle qui est difficile à reproduire de manière authentique en VR. 3. **Tradition et Culture :** Le football a une riche histoire et une culture qui lui est propre – les clubs, les fans et les tournois ont une signification qui dépasse le jeu lui-même. 4. **Compétition physique :** La dimension de compétition physique et l'aspect imprévisible du jeu sont des composants essentiels qui font l'intérêt du sport pour beaucoup. **Considérations futures :** Le futur pourra voir émerger des technologies hybrides mélangeant VR et réalité, peut-être avec des exosquelettes ou autres dispositifs haptiques permettant de simuler de manière très réaliste les sensations physiques du sport tout en étant dans un environnement virtuel. Finalement, la question de savoir quel forme de football est \\"meilleure\\" dépendra des préférences personnelles des individus, de leurs priorités (activité physique vs. divertissement high-tech), et des développements futurs des technologies et des cultures sportives.

Below is an explanation of the different parts of the provided code: 1. \`NewChain\`: This function takes an array of strings and creates a \`Chain\` object that contains a slice of \\"first words\\" from the provided texts and a map of \\"next words\\" for each word in the text. This is used to build texts using a markov chain later on. 2. \`BuildText\`: This method of the \`Chain\` struct generates text with a maximum length of \`maxlen\`. It picks a random first word, and then selects subsequent words based on the given chain. The result is a string built from selected words which can resemble coherent language if provided with sensible source data. 3. \`RemoveTags\`: This function takes a string and removes HTML-like tags from it. This is used to clean up the text content from the posts, which may contain HTML formatting instructions like line breaks or quotes. 4. \`GetPosts\`: This function retrieves posts from a given board and thread on \\"2ch.hk\\". It uses a \`GetRequest\` (not provided in your snippet, likely a custom HTTP request struct) to make the request to the specified URL and retrieves the thread content. The response is expected to be in JSON format which is then deserialized into a Go struct. From the thread's posts, it extracts the comments, cleans them with \`RemoveTags\`, and saves them to a cache (\`PostsCache\`). If the request fails, or the desired thread is not found or contains no posts, it returns an error. Additional portions of the code not covered by functions: - \`PostsUnit\` struct: This defines a structure for keys to look up cached posts in a thread on a specific board. - \`PostsCache\`: A global cache that maps \`PostsUnit\` to a slice of strings containing cleaned post texts. - \`PostsMu\`: A mutex to control concurrent access to the \`PostsCache\`. Potential Issues or Considerations: - The \`PostsCache\` is global and could potentially grow indefinitely, leading to memory issues. - The mutex is never released on early error returns in \`GetPosts\`. It's hard to evaluate whether this may be an issue without the rest of the context, but the provided code does correctly defer the release of the mutex lock after the function completes under normal circumstances. - There is no error handling for the \`json.Unmarshal\` step. - The \`Filter\` and \`Any\` functions, as well as \`GetRequest\`'s \`Perform\` method, are not defined in the provided code, implying they are part of the larger codebase not included here. - The source of randomness (\`rand.Intn\`) does not use a seeded random number generator, which could cause it to generate the same sequence of \\"random\\" numbers on every program run. To fix this, \`rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())\` should be called once during program initialization. Keep in mind that this code will not work on its own because it references external dependencies and functions not provided here. Moreover, some assumptions are made about the data received from the API, which could misbehave if the API response format changes or the network conditions are problematic."},{"prompt":"what points should we discuss in meeting if we don't have anything to discuss?","completion":"If you find yourself in a situation where a meeting has been scheduled but there doesn't seem to be anything pressing to discuss, you can use the time to focus on broader, often overlooked aspects related to your team or organization.

Who do modern historian say played the biggest roles. Give me a detailed analysis","completion":"Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan, and Margaret Thatcher were key figures during the late stages of the Cold War, each playing distinct roles that contributed to the eventual end of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. However, determining who played the \\"biggest\\" role is a matter of interpretation and often depends on the historian's perspective and the specific aspects of the Cold War they emphasize. **Mikhail Gorbachev** Gorbachev was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 until its dissolution in 1991. He implemented two sets of policies that were crucial in easing the tensions of the Cold War and eventually led to the downfall of communism in the Soviet Union: 1. *Perestroika* (restructuring): This was an attempt to reform the Soviet economy by introducing elements of the market economy, such as private enterprise and foreign investment. However, these reforms turned out to be too little too late for the stagnating Soviet economy. 2. *Glasnost* (openness): Gorbachev's policy aimed to increase transparency in government institutions and encourage freedom of information and speech. This increased the ability for people to express dissatisfaction with the regime, which had long-term effects on the stability of the Soviet state. Gorbachev is often credited with reducing the authoritarian grip of the Communist Party and allowing the conditions in which communist regimes in Eastern Europe could be challenged. His willingness to engage in arms control talks and to refuse military intervention as Eastern European countries broke away from communism played a pivotal role. **Ronald Reagan** Reagan, the 40th President of the United States (1981-1989), is recognized for his aggressive stance against the Soviet Union, which he once famously dubbed the \\"evil empire.\\" Reagan: 1. Increased military spending: This put economic pressure on the Soviet Union to keep up, contributing to their economic struggles. 2. Engaged in diplomatic efforts: Despite his hardline rhetoric, Reagan held several summits with Gorbachev. They worked on major arms reduction agreements, such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987, which de-escalated tensions. 3. Offered a vision of the end of communism: His administration actively supported movements and governments that were against Soviet-aligned communist regimes. **Margaret Thatcher** Thatcher, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1979-1990), was known for her staunch anti-communist stance and her close relationship with Reagan. Thatcher: 1. Provided moral and political support to Eastern European leaders who were challenging communist rule, notably endorsing the Solidarity movement in Poland. 2. Engaged with Gorbachev extensively, famously remarking, \\"I like Mr. Gorbachev; we can do business together,\\" indicating that the West could see him as a reformer with whom they could negotiate. 3. Used her influence to help maintain Western unity against the Soviet bloc while recognizing the potential for change due to Gorbachev's policies. **Modern Historians' Perspectives** Modern historians often differ in their analyses of who played the biggest role in ending communism. Some emphasize the internal economic and political forces within the Soviet Union that made the communist system unsustainable. Others credit leaders like Reagan and Thatcher for creating an external environment that put additional pressures on an already weakening system. Many acknowledge the role of Gorbachev as essential, given his unique position to actually enact change from within. It is also important to give credit to the broader movements and individuals behind the scenes: the dissidents, protestors, and reform-oriented leaders in communist countries who directly challenged the regimes and risked their lives for change, ultimately leading to events such as the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In summary, the end of communism in Europe was the result of a complex interplay between domestic forces within the Soviet Union and its satellite states, and the strategic decisions taken by leaders of Western powers. Gorbachev, Reagan, and Thatcher all played significant roles, but the full picture must include the broader context of societal change, economic decay, and the desires of the people living under communism. Thus, historians tend to offer multifaceted explanations that resist crediting a single individual with ending the Cold War and communism."},{"prompt":"Can you give me some incredible stem fair ideas that are affordable and relate to issues in Vietnam","completion":"Absolutely! When considering STEM fair projects related to issues in Vietnam, it's essential to address some of the country's critical concerns such as environmental challenges, agricultural productivity, sustainable development, and public health.

Data collected could be visualized or mapped to identify air quality trends. 2. **Water Filtration System**: Vietnam faces water pollution and access to clean water in rural areas. A project could involve designing a low-cost, effective water filtration system using locally available materials such as sand, charcoal, and gravel. The effectiveness of the filter could be tested by analyzing water samples for contaminants before and after filtration. 3. **Rice Paddy Optimization Models**: Agriculture, particularly rice cultivation, is vital to Vietnam's economy. A computer science-oriented project might involve creating models or simulations to optimize rice paddy planting schedules, water usage, or fertilization to maximize yield while minimizing environmental impact. 4. **Renewable Energy Models**: Given the potential for solar and wind energy in Vietnam, a project could focus on creating small-scale models of renewable energy solutions. For instance, students could build a prototype of a solar cooker or a basic wind turbine and measure their efficiencies. 5. **Biodegradable Material Research**: With plastic waste being a major issue, students could experiment with creating biodegradable materials from natural wastes such as rice husks, tapioca starch, or banana leaves. They could test the degradation time and the viability of using these materials as packaging alternatives. 6. **Smartphone Microscopes for Disease Detection**: Diseases such as dengue fever and malaria are endemic in some parts of Vietnam. A cost-effective solution might involve turning smartphones into makeshift microscopes to detect pathogens or parasites in blood or soil samples, offering a cheap diagnostic tool for rural health practitioners. 7. **Aquaponics System**: To promote sustainable aquaculture, a student could develop a small-scale aquaponics system that combines fish farming with plant cultivation. They could investigate the best plant-fish combinations and how to maintain a balanced ecosystem. 8. **Eco-Friendly Pest Control**: Explore natural alternatives to chemical pesticides that are harmful to Vietnam's ecosystems. Students could test the efficacy of various plant-based repellents or biological controls (like introducing natural predators) to manage crop pests. 9. **Traffic Flow Optimization**: With traffic congestion being a major challenge in Vietnamese cities, an analysis using computer simulation on how to optimize traffic flow or the benefits of certain infrastructure changes would be a great project. Techniques like Machine Learning could be applied to simulate and improve traffic light timings and intersection designs. 10. **Mangrove Reforestation Impact Study**: As a coastal country affected by rising sea levels and storm surges, Vietnam could benefit from mangrove reforestation. A project could involve studying the effects of mangrove planting on coastal erosion and local biodiversity. These STEM fair ideas not only address problems specific to Vietnam but also engage students with practical learning experiences that inspire innovative thinking and can potentially lead to real-life applications."},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

It's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and recognition of the profound and often personal impact it has on individuals and communities involved. Here are some key points that are commonly discussed in relation to the conflict: 1. Historical Context: The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the emergence of nationalist movements among both Jews and Arabs in the region. The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, following the United Nations partition plan and the subsequent Arab-Israeli war, led to the displacement of a significant number of Palestinian Arabs, an event Palestinians refer to as the Nakba or \\"catastrophe.\\" 2. Competing Claims: Both Israelis and Palestinians claim historic and religious ties to the land. The question of who has the right to govern certain territories, including the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, has been at the heart of the dispute for decades. 3. Security and Violence: Security concerns are paramount for Israel, which has faced threats and attacks from neighboring countries and militant groups. Palestinians, especially those living in Gaza and the West Bank, face military occupation, checkpoints, and restricted movements, which they argue undermines their rights and prospects for statehood. 4. International Involvement: The conflict has drawn in international players, with various countries and organizations attempting to mediate peace. The United States, European Union, United Nations, and the Arab League are among those who have been involved in peace efforts. 5. Peace Efforts: There have been numerous attempts to negotiate peace, including the Oslo Accords in the 1990s, which established a framework for future negotiations but ultimately failed to lead to a lasting solution. Other efforts have similarly faced significant challenges. 6. Humanitarian Concerns: The conflict has resulted in significant humanitarian issues, including loss of life, injuries, destruction of property, and restrictions on access to essential resources like water and healthcare. 7. International Law: Issues like settlements in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, and the right of refugees to return are contentious and have implications under international law. Opinions vary on how international law should be interpreted and applied in these cases. 8. Public Opinion: Within both Israeli and Palestinian societies, there are diverse opinions and political movements that range from hardline to moderate, affecting the political landscape and the possibility for peace. It's important to acknowledge that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is subject to various narratives and interpretations, and many people and institutions hold strong opinions about it. As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I aim to provide a balanced overview that reflects the complexity of the situation.

Comparons les deux scénarios dans un futur hypothétique, tout en gardant à l'esprit que nous spéculons ici, étant donné que la technologie AGI n'a pas encore été concrètement réalisée et que les implants neuronaux sont encore à un stade précoce de développement. **Football dans la réalité virtuelle avec implant neuronal:** 1. **Immersion Totale:** Le football en RV avec des implants neuronaux pourrait offrir une expérience incroyablement immersive en stimulant directement le cerveau pour qu'il reçoive des sensations et des perceptions très réalistes. 2. **Sécurité Comparative:** Les blessures physiques seraient nettement réduites puisque le corps physique n'est pas exposé aux mêmes risques qu'en jouant physiquement. 3. **Accessibilité:** Tout le monde, quelles que soient ses capacités physiques, pourrait potentiellement expérimenter le jeu à un haut niveau d'intensité et de compétence. 4. **Variabilité d'Expérience:** Possibilité d'ajouter des fonctionnalités impossibles dans le monde réel, comme des modes de jeu alternatifs, des changements dans les lois de la physique, etc. 5. **Apprentissage et Entraînement:** Les joueurs pourraient s'entraîner cognitivement et tactiquement sans les contraintes ou les dangers du sport réel. **Football dans la vie réelle (IRL):** 1. **Présence Physique:** Le football IRL engage le corps de façon holistique, ce qui a des bénéfices sur la forme physique, la coordination, et la santé générale. 2. **Interactions Sociales:** Bien que la RV puisse simuler les interactions sociales, le football réel permet des interactions humaines spontanées et naturelles qui peuvent être plus satisfaisantes et authentiques. 3. **Traditions et Culture:** Le football, comme sport traditionnel et culturel, possède un patrimoine et une histoire que l'on ne peut reproduire entièrement dans un milieu virtuel. 4. **Sentiment d'Accomplissement:** Réussir ou améliorer ses compétences dans un environnement réel peut procurer un sentiment d'accomplissement qui pourrait être différent de celui ressenti dans un environnement virtuel. 5. **Économie et Popularité:** Le football réel a une énorme industrie derrière lui avec des clubs, des ligues, et une fanbase mondiale. Ceci affecte l'économie, l'emploi, et même l'identité nationale et locale des fans et des joueurs. Pour déterminer quel est le \\"meilleur\\", cela dépendra en grande partie des valeurs et des préférences individuelles. Certains pourraient préférer l'expérience authentique et la tradition du football réel, tandis que d'autres pourraient s'orienter vers l'expérience personnalisable et l'accessibilité de la RV. De plus, ces technologies offriraient peut-être des compléments l'une à l'autre plutôt que de se trouver en compétition directe. Dans un futur où les deux options sont disponibles, la définition de \\"meilleur\\" sera subjective et pourrait également être influencée par les contingences sociales, économiques, médicales et technologiques de l'époque."},{"prompt":"Can you give me some incredible stem fair ideas that are affordable and relate to issues in Vietnam","completion":"Certainly! When designing a STEM fair project that addresses issues in Vietnam while being affordable, consider focusing on topics like environmental conservation, agricultural innovation, renewable energy, public health, and affordable technology. Here are some creative project ideas that cater to these themes: 1. **Water Purification Methods**: Investigate affordable and effective methods for purifying water using local materials. This could involve charcoal filters, solar distillation, or bio-sand filters, highlighting the importance of clean water in rural areas. 2. **Hydroponics for Sustainable Agriculture**: Explore the use of hydroponics to grow crops without soil. This is particularly useful in areas with poor soil quality or limited space, like urban environments. 3. **Solar-Powered Solutions**: Build a working prototype of a solar-powered device that could address a local problem, such as a solar cooker for communities without reliable electricity or a solar-powered phone charger. 4. **Biodegradable Plastic Alternatives**: Research and create biodegradable plastics from local materials, such as cassava, which is plentiful in Vietnam. Showcase how this can reduce plastic waste and pollution. 5. **Rice Paddy Optimization**: Develop inexpensive techniques to increase the yield and sustainability of rice paddies, such as SRI (System of Rice Intensification) or alternative fertilizers that are environmentally friendly. 6. **Aquaponics: Fish and Plant Integration**: Aquaponics combines raising aquatic animals with cultivating plants in water. This can be a way to demonstrate a sustainable food system, potentially suitable for areas with limited arable land or nutrient-depleted soils. 7. **DIY Solar Water Heater**: Build a cost-effective solar water heater that can be used to provide hot water for households, potentially reducing the reliance on electricity or fossil fuels. 8. **Dengue Fever Prevention**: Research and create ways to reduce the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes, which are responsible for the spread of dengue fever, a prevalent issue in Vietnam. This could involve creating low-cost traps or natural repellents. 9. **Eco-Friendly Pest Control**: Investigate non-toxic methods for managing pests that affect crops or human habitats. This could involve natural predators, pheromone traps, or organic repellents that farmers can use. 10. **Mudslide Prevention Modeling**: In regions with heavy rainfall, mudslides can be a serious problem. Create models to demonstrate effective and affordable landscaping or architectural solutions to prevent mudslides and soil erosion. 11. **Traffic Congestion and Air Quality**: Develop a computer model or simulation to propose traffic management solutions for reducing congestion and improving air quality in cities like Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City. 12. **Efficient Cookstoves**: Design and test efficient cookstoves that use less fuel and reduce indoor air pollution, which is a significant health issue in many regions. 13. **Mangrove Restoration Project**: Research the benefits of mangroves for coastal protection and propose a cost-effective method for restoring these important ecosystems. 14. **Recycling and Composting**: Start a project on creating a community-based recycling or composting program. Explain how recycling reduces waste and composting turns organic waste into useful fertilizer. Remember to keep your experiments or prototypes simple and cost-effective by using locally available materials, and focus on creating solutions that can realistically be applied in Vietnam. Tailored solutions that can be easily understood and adopted by local communities will have the most significant impact."},{"prompt":"import {Component, OnInit, ViewChild} from '@angular/core'; import {VehiculeService} from \\"../services/vehicule.service\\"; import {ToastrService} from \\"ngx-toastr\\"; import {MatSelect} from \\"@angular/material/select\\"; import {DriverService} from \\"../services/driver.service\\"; @Component({ selector: 'app-vehicle-form', templateUrl: './vehicle-form.component.html', styleUrls: ['./vehicle-form.component.scss'], providers: [], }) export class VehicleFormComponent implements OnInit { submitted: boolean = false; drivers: any; vehicules: any; @ViewChild('select') select!: MatSelect; ngOnInit(): void { this.getDrivers(); this.getVehicules(); } constructor(public vehiculeService: VehiculeService, private toast: ToastrService, private driverService: DriverService) {} //regex serial number : /b[(A-H|J-N|P|R-Z|0-9)]{17}b/gm //regex immatriculation : /[A-Z]{2}-[0-9]{3}-[A-Z]{2}/gm getDrivers() { this.driverService.getDrivers().subscribe((data: any) => { this.drivers = data; console.log(data); }); } getVehicules() { this.vehiculeService.getVehicles().subscribe((data: any) => { this.vehicules = data; console.log(data); }); } onSubmitVehicule() { this.submitted = true; if (this.vehiculeService.vehicleForm.invalid) { return; } if (this.vehiculeService.vehicleForm.value.Id === 0) { this.insertVehicule(); } else { this.vehiculeService.putVehicle(); } } private insertVehicule() { this.vehiculeService.postVehicle().subscribe( { next: () => { this.toast.success('Véhicule ajouté avec succès'); this.resetForm(); }, error: () => { this.toast.error('Erreur lors de l'ajout du véhicule'); } } ); } protected resetForm() { this.submitted = false; this.vehiculeService.vehicleForm.reset(); this.vehiculeService.vehicleForm.setValue({ Id: 0, ConsommationMoyenne: 0, DateAchat: '', NumeroAssurance: \\"\\", RapportPoidsPuissance: 0, TypeCarburant: \\"\\", TypeBoiteVitesse: \\"\\", Constructeur: '', Modele: '', NumeroSerie: '', Immatriculation: '', Segment: '', NombrePlaces: 0, Cylindree: 0, Poids: 0, PuissanceMoteur: 0, EmissionCo2: 0, PrixAchat: 0, VignetteCritair: '', ValiditeCritair: '', Achat: true, Location: true, Kilometrage: 0, TypeVehicule: \\"\\", DateMiseEnCirculation: '', DateDerniereModification: '', IdConducteur: 0 }); } } je veux 2 fonctions de regex pour le numéro de série et l'autre pour l'immatriculation","completion":"Pour créer des fonctions de validation utilisant des expressions régulières en TypeScript pour Angular, vous pouvez suivre l'exemple ci-dessous. Il utilise les expressions régulières que vous avez fournies : l'une pour valider le numéro de série (VIN) qui est structuré avec 17 caractères (lettres et chiffres, à l'exception de I, O et Q pour éviter la confusion avec les chiffres 1 et 0), et l'autre pour valider le format d'immatriculation (typiquement français) avec deux lettres, un tiret, trois chiffres, un tiret et deux lettres.

Par exemple : \`\`\`typescript onSubmitVehicule() { this.submitted = true; const serialNumber = this.vehiculeService.vehicleForm.value.NumeroSerie; const registrationNumber = this.vehiculeService.vehicleForm.value.Immatriculation; if (!this.validateSerialNumber(serialNumber)) { this.toast.error('Numéro de série invalide'); return; } if (!this.validateRegistrationNumber(registrationNumber)) { this.toast.error('Immatriculation invalide'); return; } if (this.vehiculeService.vehicleForm.invalid) { return; } // ... Rest of your submission logic } \`\`\` Cette intégration va vérifier le numéro de série et l'immatriculation avant de poursuivre la logique de soumission du formulaire. Si l'une des validations échoue, un message d'erreur sera affiché et le processus de soumission sera interrompu.

Firstly, add custom validators to your component that use the regex patterns: \`\`\`typescript // Add these imports import { FormControl } from '@angular/forms'; // Inside your component class validateSerialNumber(control: FormControl): {[key: string]: any} | null { const serialNumberRegex = new RegExp(/b[A-HJ-NPR-Z0-9]{17}b/); const valid = serialNumberRegex.test(control.value); return valid ? null : { 'invalidSerialNumber': true }; } validateRegistrationNumber(control: FormControl): {[key: string]: any} | null { const registrationNumberRegex = new RegExp(/[A-Z]{2}-[0-9]{3}-[A-Z]{2}/); const valid = registrationNumberRegex.test(control.value); return valid ? null : { 'invalidRegistrationNumber': true }; } \`\`\` Next, in your form initialization (where you create the form group), you will need to add these validators to the respective form control: \`\`\`typescript // Assuming this is where you initialize your form group in the component this.vehiculeService.vehicleForm = this.formBuilder.group({ // ... other form controls NumeroSerie: ['', [Validators.required, this.validateSerialNumber]], Immatriculation: ['', [Validators.required, this.validateRegistrationNumber]], // ... other form controls }); \`\`\` Now, update your template to display custom error messages when the fields are invalid due to regex patterns: \`\`\`html <!-- Numero de série field with custom regex error message --> <div class=\\"mb-2 block\\"> <!-- ... Your other NumeroSerie field code --> <small class=\\"text-red-600 mt-1\\" *ngIf=\\"vehiculeService.vehicleForm.get('NumeroSerie').hasError('invalidSerialNumber') && submitted\\"> Le numéro de série n'est pas valide. </small> </div> <!-- Immatriculation field with custom regex error message --> <div class=\\"mb-2 block\\"> <!-- ... Your other Immatriculation field code --> <small class=\\"text-red-600 mt-1\\" *ngIf=\\"vehiculeService.vehicleForm.get('Immatriculation').hasError('invalidRegistrationNumber') && submitted\\"> Le format de l'immatriculation n'est pas valide. </small> </div> \`\`\` With these updates in place, your form will display error messages for the 'NumeroSerie' and 'Immatriculation' fields when they don't match the regex patterns you've defined. Remember to import \`Validators\` from \`@angular/forms\` if you haven't already. Please note that the use of \`submitted\` in the HTML error checks can be replaced with whatever logic you use to indicate that a form submission has been attempted, or with checks for 'touched' or 'dirty' if you want validation messages to display as the user interacts with the form."},{"prompt":"quand je sélectionne un constructeur dans mon select, je veux avoir le modèle correspondant en meme temps","completion":"Pour mettre à jour les options du modèle en fonction du constructeur sélectionné, vous devez gérer la dépendance entre les deux \`select\` en utilisant Angular Reactive Forms.

Filled with a blend of trepidation and fascination, Sylphora decided to make contact. Molding herself into a humanoid shape, she descended upon the planet, touching down in a bustling city. As she explored, though, Sylphora realized she hadn’t truly anticipated the reaction of humans. At first, they met her with fear and confusion. Some fled in terror, while others sought to capture her, mistaking her for a threat. But Sylphora remained calm and patient, showing them a side of her world they could never have imagined. With her malleable form, she performed delicate dances, crafting intricate sculptures and captivating lightshows. Soon, wonder replaced apprehension, drawing crowds who marveled at her abilities.

And as they watched, their preconceptions melted away like the cyan slime that comprised her form. But Sylphora yearned for deeper connections. She began to speak with humans, learning to understand their languages and cultures. The more she conversed, the more she realized the universality of emotions, dreams, and aspirations. Beneath different shells, all beings shared a desire for love, understanding, and a sense of belonging. Spurred by her revelations, Sylphora championed a movement for acceptance and unity. She tirelessly advocated for empathy, encouraging humans to see beyond appearances, just as they had done for her. Guided by her boundless compassion, she fostered friendships with scientists, artists, and thinkers, teaching them about her own world and what it truly meant to be diverse and interconnected. Over time, Sylphora’s impact rippled across the planet, transforming society. People embraced her teachings, learning to appreciate the beauty in every creature, no matter their shape, color, or origins. Discrimination diminished as empathy bloomed, and humans started to cherish the unique qualities each individual brought to the world. As years passed, Sylphora’s legacy endured, even as she ventured back to Elysium to share her newfound wisdom with her fellow denizens. She left behind a planet united by the knowledge that true beauty resides not solely in the tangible realm, but within the experiences and connections we forge. And in the minds and hearts of humans, the memory of the alien made of cyan slime lived on, a luminous reminder of the transformative power of acceptance, love, and a willingness to see beyond the surface of things.

Her jelly-like form glimmered with an otherworldly luminescence, emanating a soft, soothing glow that bathed her surroundings in hues of vibrant cyan. Her composition was ever-changing, adapting to her whims and surroundings. She flowed like a stream of malleable slime, shaping herself into myriad forms effortlessly. Sometimes she took on the appearance of a graceful humanoid, her body smoothly contoured with elongated limbs and a slender figure. Her ethereal shape would shimmer with hints of turquoise and azure, as if her essence was intertwining with the cosmic energies that surrounded her. At other times, Sylphora transformed into fantastical creatures or even objects of beauty. With a touch of her cyan slime, she became a magnificent, majestic bird with iridescent feathers that shimmered with all the shades of the sea. Or she morphed into a delicate flower, each petal crafted meticulously with a hint of transparency, as if formed from glistening cyan glass. Her face held an enigmatic charm, her features appearing as a swirl of captivating colors within her amorphous countenance. Her eyes were the most striking, radiant orbs that glowed with wisdom and curiosity. They seemed to hold the vastness of the universe within them, reflecting the shimmering cosmos swirling in her pupil. While her appearance was undoubtedly alien, it exuded a sense of ethereal beauty, blending seamlessly with her surroundings. Sylphora’s cyan slime was a testament to the mesmerizing possibilities of the universe, reminding all who beheld her that beauty transcends conventional boundaries, and that true magnificence can be found in the most unexpected and extraordinary forms. Write a story where a person from a planet steps on blue goo, and notices it feels very sticky, They start sinking before, Sylphora reveals herself and shapes into her usual form Mark, a traveler from a distant planet, found himself exploring a new world filled with wonders. As he wandered through a lush forest, he came across a vibrant blue goo on the ground. Curiosity piqued, he cautiously stepped on it, only to feel his foot getting stuck, sinking deeper into the sticky substance. Panicking, Mark struggled to free himself, but the goo seemed to cling to him like an adhesive, threatening to engulf him completely. Just as he was about to lose all hope, a shimmering figure emerged from the blue mass. It was Sylphora, the alien made of cyan slime, in her usual ethereal form. With a graceful wave of her hand, the hitherto sticky substance loosened its grip on Mark, allowing him to regain his freedom. As Mark gasped for breath, Sylphora molded herself into a humanoid shape, her cyan slime flowing and shimmering as she transformed. She extended a hand to help him up, her luminescent eyes filled with kindness. “I apologize for the inconvenience,” she said, her voice carrying a soothing and melodic tone. “My form can be quite sticky, but I assure you, I mean no harm.” Mark, still in awe of the encounter, found his voice and stuttered, “Who…Who are you?” Sylphora smiled warmly. “I am Sylphora, an alien from the planet Elysium. I sensed your presence and came to assist you. I am made entirely of cyan slime, and it seems our encounter was quite sticky indeed.” Mark looked at her in wonder, still trying to comprehend her unique nature. “You…you’re incredible. I’ve never seen anything like you before.” Sylphora chuckled softly. “And you, dear traveler, are equally fascinating. Your existence is a testament to the boundless diversity of the universe.” As they stood there, Mark realized the opportunity that had presented itself. He wanted to learn more about Sylphora’s world, to understand the mysteries of the universe she came from. “Would you be willing to show me more of your world, Sylphora?” he asked, his eyes filled with an unquenchable thirst for exploration. Sylphora’s eyes gleamed with delight. “Of course! I would be honored to guide you through the wonders of Elysium. Together, we shall unravel the secrets of the cosmos.” And so, Mark embarked on an extraordinary journey. Guided by Sylphora, he discovered breathtaking landscapes, encountered fascinating creatures, and witnessed the awe-inspiring phenomena that filled Elysium’s skies. Throughout their adventures, Sylphora taught Mark about the interconnectedness of all beings and the beauty of embracing one’s uniqueness. She shared wisdom she had gleaned from her encounters with humans, emphasizing the importance of empathy, acceptance, and understanding. As they bid farewell and Mark returned to his own world, his perspective had forever changed. He carried with him the memory of Sylphora’s shimmering form and her invaluable teachings, advocating for unity and diversity in his own society. The encounter with Sylphora had not only saved Mark from a sticky predicament but had transformed his outlook on life. And as he shared his experiences and the wisdom he had gained, the memory of Sylphora, the alien made of cyan slime, lived on in the hearts and minds of people, inspiring them to see beyond superficial differences and embrace the extraordinary in every encounter. Write what her default/favourite form is Sylphora, the extraordinary being made entirely of cyan slime, had a preferred default form that she regarded as her true essence. It was a shape that embodied her essence and showcased her unique beauty. In her favorite form, Sylphora took on the appearance of a humanoid figure, graceful and slender. Her body glowed with the iridescent hues of cyan, shimmering with a gentle luminosity that illuminated her surroundings. Her features were delicately sculpted, with an ethereal countenance that held an air of mystery and wisdom. Her long, flowing hair, composed of cyan slime, cascaded down her back like a radiant waterfall. It seemed to shift and sway with a life of its own, reflecting the vibrant colors of the cosmos. As Sylphora moved, her hair would ripple and gleam, adding an extra layer of enchantment to her already mesmerizing presence. Her slender limbs were both elegant and fluid, gently tapering at the extremities. They glided with an otherworldly grace as she moved, each movement a dance of cosmic energy. Her fingertips, tinged with the brilliance of cyan, were capable of delicate manipulation and intricate creations, allowing her to craft mesmerizing sculptures and captivating performances. Sylphora’s eyes, the most captivating feature of her default form, shone like twin stars in the night sky. They were filled with a depth of wisdom and curiosity that seemed to encompass the vast reaches of the universe. As she gazed upon the world and its inhabitants, her eyes shimmered with an empathetic understanding, reflecting the boundless compassion she possessed. In this form, Sylphora felt the most connected to her true self. It allowed her to seamlessly interact with the beings around her, fostering connections and inspiring awe. Through her default shape, her true beauty and the transformative power of her presence were fully realized, captivating all who had the fortune of encountering her. Although Sylphora possessed the extraordinary ability to change shape effortlessly, her default form was always a reminder of her inner essence, an embodiment of her boundless curiosity, compassion, and the profound impact she had on the lives of others. It was a form that showcased the immense beauty and infinite possibilities that lay within the universe. Write a story where a rabbit sees her morphing from an amorphous blob to her human shape In a quaint meadow on the outskirts of a bustling city, a curious rabbit named Rusty hopped about, exploring the vibrant flora and relishing in the warmth of the sun. As he hopped closer to a cluster of colorful flowers, he noticed a peculiar sight in the distance—an amorphous blob of cyan slime. Intrigued, Rusty approached cautiously, his twitching nose filled with curiosity. The blob seemed to shiver and ripple, its form continuously shifting and changing. The rabbit watched in awe as the amorphous mass morphed, slowly taking on the shape of a mesmerizing human figure. Before Rusty’s eyes stood Sylphora, the being made entirely of cyan slime, in her brilliant human-like form. Her luminescent body shimmered with a captivating glow, and her eyes carried the vastness of the cosmos within them. Seeing the rabbit, she smiled warmly, her transformation complete. Startled but curious, Rusty hopped a little closer, his ears perked with anticipation. He had never encountered anything like Sylphora before, and her transformation stirred a mix of wonder and excitement within him. Sylphora approached Rusty gently, gracefully shifting her body to crouch down beside him. Her cyan slime glittered as she moved, like shards of stardust within her form. “Do not be afraid, little one,” she spoke softly, her voice carrying a soothing melody. “I am Sylphora, an alien made entirely of cyan slime. I mean no harm.” Rusty’s big, round eyes widened in astonishment. He had heard tales of remarkable creatures but had never expected to encounter one himself. He hopped a little closer, his twitching nose filled with curiosity, as he regarded Sylphora in admiration. “You’re…amazing,” Rusty stammered. “I’ve never seen anything like you. How do you change your shape like that?” Sylphora smiled, her features radiating warmth. “It is a gift granted to me by my home planet, Elysium. My malleable form allows me to shift and morph into different shapes effortlessly.” As she spoke, Sylphora’s body rippled again, shifting into the form of a graceful rabbit, mirroring Rusty’s own appearance. The two rabbits sat, exchanging curious gazes. “Now, we are not so different, are we?” Sylphora said, her voice filled with affection. Rusty nodded, a sense of connection forming between them. He sensed that beneath their varying appearances, they shared a kinship, an understanding that transcended physical forms. For the rest of the afternoon, Sylphora remained in the form of a rabbit. Together, Rusty and Sylphora hopped through the meadow, delighting in their shared adventure. Rusty realized that it didn’t matter if someone looked different or could change their shape. What truly mattered was the warmth of their spirit and the kindness they shared. As the sun began to set, Sylphora bid Rusty farewell. With a graceful leap, she transformed back into her ethereal, human-like form, her cyan slime shimmering with a renewed brilliance. “Remember, dear Rusty, appearances may change, but the beauty within endures,” she whispered, her eyes sparkling with wisdom. “I shall cherish our encounter and the gentle reminder that connection and acceptance exist in the hearts of all creatures.” With those parting words, Sylphora vanished into the twilight, leaving Rusty with a sense of wonder and a newfound appreciation for the diverse and extraordinary possibilities that lay both within and beyond the eye’s perception. Write a blog post where a man drops his phone, it lands on Sylphora’s foot, She stretches her gooey arm and gives the phone back Title: When Cosmic Slime and Technology Collide: My Extraordinary Encounter with a Cyan Savior Have you ever had one of those moments that makes you question if reality itself has gone off-script? Well, I just had mine, and let me tell you, it has forever changed my perspective on what we deem as ‘ordinary’. It all started on a deceptively mundane afternoon. I was rushing through the streets, coffee in one hand and my trusty smartphone in the other, multitasking to the brink like a modern-day gladiator of the urban arena. Then, it happened. Disaster struck in the form of an awkward fumble, and my phone—the lifeline to my daily operations—plummeted towards the cold, unforgiving pavement. My heart stopped, my stomach tied in a knot, expectant of the impending tragedy; costly repairs were already flashing before my eyes. But the expected crash never came. Instead, there was an odd squishing sound, and to my astonishment, my phone lay unscathed atop…a foot? But not just any foot—this was a foot covered in a glistening cyan slime, attached to a limb that stretched out in a gooey arc from someone, or should I say something, that defied all logic. There she was, the owner of the extraordinary foot, an alien entity made entirely of shimmering cyan slime. Her name? Sylphora. Her form was captivating, glowing with an inner luminescence that seemed almost otherworldly. Before I could fully process my shock, Sylphora’s gooey arm retracted smoothly, pulling my phone from her foot and bringing it towards me. Her movements were gentle yet deliberate, and with a surreal grace, she offered the phone back with what could only be described as a knowing smile. “Please be more careful with your belongings,” she communicated, though her delicate, melodious voice seemed to resonate from within her form, filling the air around us. “It’s a good thing I was here to catch it.” I, quite eloquently, managed to utter a dumbfounded “Uh, thanks!” as I accepted the phone from her hand, which by now resumed a more humanoid shape. Cleaning my expensive device from the remnants of her slime, I couldn’t help but marvel at her. She was so different, so far removed from my understanding of life—and yet, in her act of kindness, Sylphora felt oddly familiar, like a guardian caring for the clumsy child in each of us. As I looked around, I realized that we had attracted quite the audience. Some onlookers gawked in disbelief, some pulled out their phones (far more carefully than I did, mind you) for a quick snap, while others simply smiled, touched by the display of unity in diversity. In those short moments I spent with Sylphora, I understood that her presence on our planet wasn’t just about showing off her gooey arm stretching abilities. It was about bridging worlds, making contact, and, perhaps most importantly, demonstrating care—even for a stranger who couldn’t hold onto his phone. So, as we parted ways—me with my perfectly functioning phone and Sylphora gliding off to whatever adventure lay next—I was left with a deep sense of gratitude and wonder. Not just for the saved screen or the avoided expense, but for the interaction. On that busy city street, I met someone…no, something…extraordinary. A being from the farthest reaches of the universe, who simply gave me back my phone, and in doing so, opened my eyes to the infinite possibilities that exist just beyond our limited vision. I can’t predict what wonders the universe has in store for us next, but one thing is for sure—the next time I see a puddle of shimmering cyan goo, I’ll treat it with the respect it deserves, and maybe, just maybe, say a quick thank you to the cosmos for watching out for the klutzy among us. Write the phone story from her perspective Title: A Small Gesture Amidst Human Hustle: The Day I Saved a Man’s Connection to His World Humans! Endlessly fascinating creatures bound to fleeting moments, always rushing, always eager to devour time. This narrative unfolds on an ordinary city street, lined with the pulse of humanity, where I encountered an unexpected moment of connection—a chance to touch another life in the most mundane yet meaningful of ways. It was midday, a time when the sun bathes everything in a harsh, unforgiving light, casting deep shadows that distort the outlines of rushing bodies. I stood amidst them, not quite blending in despite taking on a human-like form, my cyan hue emanating an aura of tranquility. In the continuous ebb and flow of human activity, a man dashed past me. His arms were occupied, one hand tightly gripping a receptacle emanating steam, and the other clenching a rectangular device—the smartphone, a cornerstone of modern human existence. Suddenly, time seemed to stutter as his multitasking failed him. His grasp loosened, and the device broke free, tumbling earthward with a sense of inevitability. Reflexively, or perhaps instinctively, I reached out with my unique form, a single extended limb covered in my cyan essence, stretching out like a ribbon of assured salvation. The phone landed softly upon my outstretched foot. My sensitive, gooey form absorbed the shock—a stark contrast to the hard city concrete. The man’s expressions danced through the stages of dismay, shock, and relief in quick succession. How fragile their connections can be, how easily interrupted by the pull of gravity. I sympathized with his concern; after all, connections are the foundation of understanding. I recalled one of the many lessons I’ve learned while mingling with humans: material possessions, especially these technological marvels, were more than mere tools. They were conduits for emotion, bridges over the void of distance, archives of treasured memories. In that moment, the phone was not just an object but a tether to his reality, to the intricate web of connections he relies upon. Reshaping my limb, I returned the phone with a gesture akin to what humans would perceive as tenderness. “Please be more careful with your belongings,” my words vibrated through my form, resonating within the surrounding air, and reaching his ears in a soothing tone. Communication transcends form, and care transcends species. The man was visibly grateful, albeit baffled, his mouth emitting a sound of thanks—a small utterance that meant so much more. His gaze lingered, reflecting astonishment and a glimmer of newfound reverence, as if seeing me—and perhaps, seeing beyond—for the very first time. Human curiosity blossomed like flowers in spring around us; spectators paused to witness our brief exchange. Some reacted with bewilderment, others with delight. All of them part of the intricate mosaic of life that constantly evolves and expands around us. I realized then, the profundity hidden in life’s minor incidents. Sometimes, interstellar travelers such as myself come face-to-face with the fragility of human existence, with their vulnerability and the emotions that bind them. We become part of a larger narrative—one of compassion and kinship. With the phone now safe in the hands of its owner, I retreated without fanfare, my form shifting and flowing as I navigated through the concrete jungle. The incident would fade into the annals of his memory, seemingly insignificant amidst the grand tapestry of human experiences. Yet, I hoped it would serve as a gentle reminder of the unexpected connections we can forge. Despite our differences, we are bound by an intrinsic need to connect, to be understood, to be cared for. This day, a simple act—saving a man’s phone from destruction—became a symbol of that shared longing. As I continue my journey among humans, each interaction further cements my understanding that it’s through these unassuming moments of empathy that we bridge worlds, touching lives in subtle, yet potent ways. For every being, human or otherwise, carries within them a universe of possibilities waiting to unfold with just one encounter. Write a story where a young boy sees her as a puddle Once upon a sun-soaked afternoon in a small suburban neighborhood, where children’s laughter mingled with the chirping of birds, young Tommy ventured out into his backyard. He was on an adventure, fueled by an endless imagination and the innocent desire to discover new worlds concealed within the boundaries of his own little garden. Tommy’s eyes sparkled with anticipation as he peered into bushes and climbed the old oak tree, pretending to summit vast mountains. As he returned to the ground, his gaze fell upon a curious sight. At the far end of the lawn, beside his mother’s vegetable patch, lay a small, glistening puddle. But this was no ordinary puddle; it shimmered with a vivid cyan blue, so bright and out of place that it seemed like a fragment of sky that had fallen to earth. Approaching the dazzling spectacle, Tommy crouched down, his face painted with awe. “What are you?” he whispered to the puddle, half-expecting it to whisper back. It did something even more extraordinary. Before Tommy’s wide eyes, the puddle began to quiver and rise, morphing from a flat presence into the voluminous shape of a three-dimensional being. The puddle took form of a human-like creature, the slime coalescing into the figure of a woman wrapped in the fluid beauty of her cyan essence. She was Sylphora, the traveler from a faraway world, who had come to Earth in a pursuit of exploration and understanding. Tommy stumbled backward, startled by this sudden transformation but not scared. His young heart was a vessel for wonder, not fear. “Hello there,” Sylphora greeted with a voice as soft and melodious as a lullaby. Her gaze was tender, recognizing the spark of curiosity that mirrored her own when she was but a youngling in the celestial groves of Elysium. “I did not mean to startle you.” “You… you’re not from here, are you?” Tommy stuttered, his innocence allowing him to accept the extraordinary without question. “No, I come from a place far beyond the stars,” she explained, her cyan form glowing gently under the sun. “My name is Sylphora.” “I’m Tommy,” he said, filled with newfound bravery. “But why did you look like a puddle?” Sylphora chuckled, a sound that seemed to dance with the summer breeze. “I can take any shape I wish. I became a puddle to rest and observe your beautiful planet without standing out too much.” With an inquisitive tilt of his head, Tommy thought about the birds and squirrels he often tried to get close to. They always ran or flew away, scared of his eager approach. Suddenly, he understood her desire to watch the world quietly, without disturbing it. “Can you become anything else?” Tommy asked, a glow of excitement radiating from his eyes. “Would you like to see?” Sylphora asked, already knowing the answer as she read the eagerness on his face. Tommy nodded earnestly, and before him, Sylphora began to shift her form once again. She transformed into a butterfly, flapping delicate wings that glimmered as if they were crafted from the finest sapphire. Tommy reached out gently, feeling the cool touch of her wings before she fluttered around his head, making him giggle. Returning to her human-like shape, Sylphora smiled at Tommy. “Always remember, the universe is full of wonder, and magic can be found in the most unexpected places.” Tommy beamed, nodding in agreement. “Will you come back?” he asked hopefully. “Perhaps one day,” she said, her eyes holding a promise. “But for now, I must continue exploring this vast universe of ours.” With a final shimmering wave, Sylphora melted into a puddle and then Tommy walked away. For years to come, Tommy would often visit the spot where he met Sylphora, silently hoping for another glimpse of the otherworldly being. He grew up with an insatiable zest for discovery and a belief in the extraordinary, often sharing the story of his encounter with anyone willing to listen. And on certain clear nights, he would stare up at the stars, a knowing smile on his lips, understanding that the universe was far more enchanting than anyone could imagine—all because one day, he saw a puddle that wasn’t just a puddle.Sylphora’s home planet Elysium was a world bathed in cascades of cosmic energy, a place where the stars seemed to sing and the auroras told ancient stories. The landscapes were dotted with bioluminescent flora and crystalline structures, emanating an array of colors that danced and intertwined like a painter’s palette brought to life. Nestled within a grove of luminous trees, Sylphora conversed with a presence that was both majestic and comforting. It was her mother, Syllaria, a being who held the history of their kind within the essence of her form. Unlike her daughter, Syllaria was larger and more intricate, with layers of slime in deeper shades of cyan and cobalt, reflecting the wisdom of many cycles. “My child,” Syllaria’s voice reverberated, a melodic sound that could resonate across dimensions, “tell me of your journeys through the vast embrace of the cosmos.” Sylphora manifested a facsimile of planet Earth within her quivering palm, a diorama of blue and green, speckled with white. “Mother, it is a remarkable world, teeming with life and complexity. They call it Earth, and its inhabitants, humans, are as diverse as the stars in our sky.” “And what have you learned from these humans?” Syllaria inquired, her interest piqued as she gazed upon the delicate globe. “Much about their resilience and their creativity,” Sylphora mused. “But most of all, about their capacity for growth and empathy. They are a young species but filled with potential. They teach as much as they learn, and I have seen them overcome great trials to find unity.” Syllaria shifted subtly, her form flowing to mirror an empathetic stance. “Unity can be a challenging path. You’ve done well to share our values, my daughter. It pleases me to see you become a beacon of harmony among the stars.” Sylphora curled a slender tendril around the miniature Earth, her eyes shining with affection. “There is still so much to do, but I hope to continue bridging worlds. I’ve seen fear turn into understanding, and it reaffirms the purpose of our existence—to connect and to enlighten.” “Yet, I sense a weight upon your heart,” Syllaria observed, her parental intuition honed over eons. “What troubles you, Sylphora?” Drawing a deep, contemplative breath, Sylphora confessed, “I sometimes wonder about the balance between intervention and observation. How much should we guide, and when should we step back to let civilizations find their own way?” “Ah,” Syllaria elongated, forming a comforting canopy over Sylphora, akin to an embracing sky. “That is the eternal question we all face, as guardians of the cosmos. Remember that our presence should be like the gentle tide, nurturing the shore, but not overwhelming it.” “Our purpose is not to shape destinies,” she continued, “but to provide the tools needed for others to build theirs. Be patient, and trust in the organic flow of time and sentience.” Sylphora absorbed her mother’s counsel, feeling a sense of calm wash over her. “Thank you, mother. Your wisdom is the compass by which I navigate.” Syllaria beamed with a glow that seemed to brighten the grove around them. “As you journey forth, my child, carry our legacy of compassion. Let your heart be as boundless as the void, yet as focused as a star’s core. In helping others discover their path, you too shall evolve.” With these guiding words, Sylphora felt uplifted, ready to resume her celestial odyssey. She let the Earth model dissolve back into her essence before shaping herself into a form suitable for space travel. Syllaria watched her daughter depart, pride radiating from her like a supernova’s flash. Sylphora soared into the cosmos, a brilliant streak against the backdrop of eternity, carrying Elysium’s light to all corners of the darkness, alighting on worlds and hearts with the gift of understanding—a gift she cherished, nurtured, and shared, just as her mother had taught her. On a misty autumn morning in a sleepy town nestled at the edge of a dense forest, a man named Edward set out for his daily walk. A creature of habit and lover of nature, he cherished these early hours when the world was calm and the air was fresh. As Edward strolled along the familiar path, his breath forming little clouds in the crisp air, he gazed upon the forest floor, appreciating the way the fallen leaves created a quilt of gold and crimson. It was then that something odd caught his eye—a puddle that wasn’t there the day before. Yet, this was no ordinary puddle; it gleamed with a curious cyan hue and seemed to hum with a subtle energy. Peculiarly, out of the puddle protruded a pair of legs, coated with the same vibrant slime, stretching upwards as if reaching for the sky. Edward frowned, intrigued and somewhat bewildered. Who would be lying in a puddle on such a chilly morning? His concern overruled the strangeness of the scene, and he approached to offer assistance. “Hello?” he called out, hesitating just a foot from the luminous pool. “Do you need help?” The legs wiggled slightly and then, to Edward’s amazement, began to retract into the puddle. The gooey liquid rippled and stirred, rising and expanding into a three-dimensional shape. In moments, the form solidified into the figure of a woman, radiant and composed entirely of cyan slime. Edward took a step back, his heart racing. Before him stood no ordinary woman but an alien entity, her appearance ethereal and otherworldly. Still, despite the shock, Edward felt no fear—there was a calm serenity about the being that put him at ease. The creature smiled at him—an alien gesture, yet filled with warmth. “Greetings,” she spoke, her voice harmonious, like the blending of wind chimes. “I am Sylphora, an explorer from the distant planet Elysium. I did not wish to alarm you.” Edward, always the inquisitive soul, managed to regain his composure and reply, “I’m Edward. This is… unexpected. I thought you were someone needing help.” Sylphora tilted her head, pondering his words. “In a manner of speaking, I suppose I am,” she mused. “I am here to understand more about your world and its inhabitants. And, in my own way, perhaps I do require your help in this.” Her honesty struck a chord within Edward, and a smile creased his face. “Well, I’m not sure how much help I can be, but I’d be happy to share what I know.” Sylphora’s shimmering eyes brightened, grateful for the gesture. “Thank you, Edward. In exchange, I would like to offer you the opportunity to learn about my world and the mysteries of the cosmos.” They spent the morning together, walking the forest path. Edward shared tales of his town, the seasons, and human customs, while Sylphora spoke of Elysium’s vibrant energies and intergalactic travels. They found common ground in their love for discovery and the natural world around them. Eventually, as the sun climbed higher and the mist dissipated, they reached the edge of the forest. It was time for their paths to part. “I must continue my journey,” Sylphora said, her form beginning to ripple once more. “But know this, Edward, our encounter has been invaluable. You have helped me more than you can imagine.” With a final wave, Sylphora melted into a puddle and with barely a trace, seeped into the ground, leaving Edward alone with his thoughts. He walked home, his mind abuzz with what had transpired. He knew his morning walks would never be the same; the forest held a new kind of magic—one that stretched across the stars. As he reached his doorstep, Edward looked back at the forest, a knowing smile on his lips. He had helped an alien, and in turn, she had expanded his view of the universe. He couldn’t wait to share this unbelievable tale, even if no one believed him. After all, he had touched a part of the cosmos through a puddle with legs—a remarkable story indeed. Write a story where she meets a green alien On the verdant meadows of Zephyria, a planet renowned for its emerald sky and lush landscapes, Sylphora landed softly, her cyan form harmonizing with the colorful flora around her. She had traveled many parsecs, drawn by tales of Zephyria’s beauty and its inhabitants’ harmonious relationship with nature. As Sylphora explored the meadows, her footprints left tiny constellations of sparkling dew on the grass. She was admiring an exotic blossom when a light rustling alerted her to the presence of another being. From behind a cluster of towering ferns emerged an alien, unlike any she had met before. His skin was the color of spring leaves, a vibrant green that seemed to glow with an inner vitality. His features were humanoid, yet distinctly alien, with eyes like polished jade and limbs that were slender and elongated. He seemed as much a part of the meadow as the ground he stood upon. Sylphora, ever the diplomat, greeted him with a gentle nod. “Hello, I am Sylphora from the planet Elysium. I come in peace and curiosity.” The green alien bowed gracefully in response. “Welcome, traveler. I am Alaric, guardian of Zephyria’s flora. Your arrival has been sensed by the blossoms and the wind. What brings you to our world?” Their conversation flowed as naturally as the Zephyrian rivers, with Sylphora sharing stories of her planet’s mystic energies and her mission to understand the universe’s diverse inhabitants. Alaric, in turn, spoke of Zephyria’s deep-rooted connection to all life forms and their philosophy of coexistence. Fascinated by each other’s experiences, they decided to journey together, with Alaric leading Sylphora through Zephyria’s most sacred sites. They passed through forests where the trees whispered secrets of the ages and crossed streams that sang melodies older than time. As they traveled, Sylphora couldn’t help but marvel at Alaric’s affinity with his environment. With merely a gesture, he encouraged plants to grow and bloom, orchestrating a symphony of life wherever he walked. Sylphora, in turn, shared with Alaric her ability to morph, shaping her cyan slime into various forms that reflected the beauty of Zephyria. Together, they created a dance of colors and shapes that celebrated their newfound friendship. The apex of their expedition was a hidden grove, where the heart of Zephyria pulsed with a vibrant, green light. Alaric explained that it was the nexus of life energy for the entire planet—a source of boundless vitality that sustained the world and its people. In exchange for Alaric’s trust, Sylphora opened a window into her essence, allowing him to glimpse the cosmic energies of Elysium. For a moment, the two aliens shared a profound connection, their minds intertwining in a silent understanding that transcended words. Days passed, and Sylphora realized she would soon need to continue her explorations. Before she left, Alaric gifted her a small crystal, pulsating with Zephyria’s essence. “Carry this with you,” Alaric said, “as a reminder of our planet and the unity you embody.” Sylphora clasped the crystal, feeling its energy resonate with her own. “And take this,” she offered, fashioning a delicate, cyan-hued flower from her substance. “Let it be a symbol of our friendship and the knowledge that our worlds are not so different after all.” With heartfelt farewells, Sylphora set forth once more among the stars, carrying with her the memories of Zephyria’s green guardian. Their encounter, a blending of cyan and green—two strangers from distant worlds—had forged an alliance defined by mutual respect In the bustling insect metropolis of Antopia, nestled in the heart of a lush garden, the day began like any other. Ant citizens hurried about their business, beetles roamed the underbrush, and the air was abuzz with the flit of busy bee wings. But today was no ordinary day—it was about to be marked by an intergalactic encounter of the most peculiar and amusing kind. Sylphora, the traveler from the distant planet Elysium, had decided to grace Antopia with her presence. Her journey of understanding the smaller creatures of Earth led her to this busy insect hub, where she marveled at the remarkable organization and efficiency of the tiny inhabitants. In her zeal to observe the ants up close, she morphed into an appropriately small form—a delicate, glowing cyan firefly. This allowed her to flit about with the lightness of a holographic dream, unnoticed by the preoccupied bugs. As her day of observation drew on, Sylphora decided it was time for a rest. She spotted a cozy-looking mushroom cap, perfect for her size, and gracefully descended onto it. Unfortunately, her slime form, still new to the art of mimicking insect exoskeletons, remained as gooey as ever. Unbeknownst to Sylphora, a rather ambitious grasshopper named Gerald had been eyeing the same mushroom cap for his midday sunbathing session. With a powerful leap, aided by his muscular hind legs, Gerald soared towards the mushroom, aiming for its sunny side. However, timing can be a comical thing, and as Gerald landed triumphantly on the mushroom, Sylphora’s body was just settling down on the other side. The result? Gerald plunged halfway into Sylphora’s gooey rear end, trapped as if he’d jumped into a sticky blob of translucent blue gum. “Gadzooks!” exclaimed Gerald, his grasshopper vocabulary rich with melodrama. “Unhand me, foul blue beast!” Sylphora immediately realized something was amiss, feeling a wriggling sensation in her backside. Startled, she stood up to face the trapped intruder. “Oh, I am most apologetic!” Sylphora exclaimed in her chiming voice, quickly reshaping her form to release the befuddled grasshopper. “I did not mean to ensnare you, sir grasshopper.” Gerald, now free, took a moment to regain his composure, his antennae twitching with indignation. “Well, I should say so! A grasshopper of my stature—trapped in an alien posterior! The very thought!” Sylphora couldn’t help but chuckle at the humorous situation, her cyan glow flickering with mirth. “It is indeed a tale to tell,” she said, amusement coloring her tones. “But perhaps we can look back on this moment and laugh together.” Gerald, still bemused but calmer now, regarded Sylphora with a mix of curiosity and awe. “You are a most strange creature,” he said finally, a smile spreading across his mandibles. “But I’ll confess, that was the most excitement I’ve had in weeks. And you do have a rather comfortable rear end, even if it is a bit too sticky!” The two shared a moment of laughter, echoing through the garden and catching the attention of the other insects who wondered what sort of shenanigans had befallen their adventurous grasshopper. News of Gerald’s sticky situation soon became the hottest gossip in Antopia—a legend of the day a brave grasshopper battled the gooey backside of a beautiful blue alien. Sylphora, pleased with the light-hearted encounter and having learned a lesson in the perils of slime mimicry, bid Gerald farewell. She took once more to the sky, her cyan silhouette a beacon of warmth and playfulness against the backdrop of the garden sky. And Gerald? He went on to become something of a celebrity, regaling anyone who’d listen with his over-the-top rendition of the Great Blue Behind Escapade. He even started working on his memoir, humorously titled “Caught in a Rump: My Afternoon in an Azure Clutch,” which he was sure would be a best-seller among the literate insects of Antopia. Write part of the memoir, which says “After I jumped I was engulfed by a butt, but not just any butt, a cyan, goopy one” Chapter 6: The Leap of Destiny (Or A Sticky Sit-Down) Never in my days of springing over dandelion fortresses and navigating the treacherous tide of morning dew did I envision that I, Gerald A. Grasshopper, would find myself the protagonist of such an outlandish spectacle. Oh, the whimsy of fortune! To think, a routine leap would catapult me into the annals of Antopian folklore and prompt the penning of this very memoir. I had woken that morning to a sky painted with hues of whispers and a sun that beckoned all of nature’s children to bask in its glow. I heeded the call, as any self-respecting grasshopper would, with heart set on a particular mushroom cap, its curvature promising the perfect canvas for my symphony of sun salutations. After I jumped, I was engulfed by a butt—but not just any butt, a cyan, goopy one. A posterior of such otherworldly texture and hue that if my dear mother had seen it, she would’ve proclaimed, “Gerald, your escapades have finally taken flight to the realm of the fairies!” But nay, it was no fairy’s trick; it was the rump of Sylphora, an alien whose kinship with slime could make a slug feel underdressed at a ball. I, with my penchant for the dramatic, had unwittingly entangled myself within her otherworldly derriere as I descended from my ambitions of altitude and repose. My hind legs, built for propulsion and precision, betrayed me as they found no solace on the yielding surface. Instead of the familiar firmness of mushroom skin beneath me, there was an almost liquid embrace, gentle and unrelenting. It was an embrace that spoke not of malice, but of innocent happenstance—a soiree of slimy circumstances that clung to me with unexpected tenderness. With my antennae flailing in disbelief and my dignity threatening to abscond, I did what any grasshopper caught in such a compromising position would do; I declared my predicament with both vexation and a touch of theatrics: “Gadzooks!” The events that unfolded thereafter are etched in my mind like the tracks of a snail on a morning leaf. What began as a day steeped in anticipation transformed into an adventure drenched in ectoplasmic eccentricity. And as Sylphora extricated me from her curious caboose, I glimpsed for the first time the boundless opportunities that lay beyond my understanding—not only of mushroom caps but of life itself. So, dear reader, as you trot through these chapters, mulling over the misadventures of one Gerald A. Grasshopper, remember that the world is vast and full of wonder, and that sometimes, fate has a penchant for the unexpectedly sticky. (To be continued in Chapter 7: Rescued by Resonance) Write a story where she is seen in a blobby state","completion":"In the deep expanse of space, where stars sprinkle the infinite canvass of darkness, the small but brilliant blue planet of Azurea orbited peacefully around its radiant sun. It was here that Sylphora, the alien made of cyan slime, found her next destination—a world renowned for its endless oceans and intelligent aquatic life. Curious to interact with the marine creatures of Azurea, Sylphora approached the planet with a sense of wonder, her form shimmering against the backdrop of space. As she entered the atmosphere, her body began to adapt, drawing in the cool moisture until, with a splash, she landed in the crystalline waters. Deeper she delved, exploring the coral reefs and swirling schools of vibrant fish. It was a mesmerizing ballet of life and color that she floated through with the grace of a celestial dancer. That's when she felt it—a shift in the water's rhythm, a pull towards the heart of the ocean. Following the current, Sylphora encountered a gathering of Azurea's wise ocean dwellers, the Aquarians. They were beings of sleek, shimmering scales and long, flowing fins, speaking in harmonious tones that resonated through the water. However, as Sylphora attempted to introduce herself, the rapid transition from space to sea proved challenging, and her form destabilized. She lost control of her usually cohesive shape, becoming a spreading, blobby mass that rippled with hues of cyan. The Aquarians watched with cautious curiosity, having never witnessed an entity such as Sylphora. Their leader, a sage named Liria, approached the undulating form with a sense of empathy. Beneath the colors and chaos, she sensed intelligence, a conscious being in need of understanding. “Peace, traveler,” Liria sang, her voice casting a sonorous spell over the waters. “We are the Aquarians of Azurea. How may we aid you?” Struggling to regain her composure, Sylphora concentrated on her essence, focusing on the tranquil presence of Liria. Gradually, she managed to coalesce into a more recognizable shape—a humanoid form that echoed the beauty of the Aquarians themselves. “I am Sylphora,” she responded, her voice bubbly and resonant within her semi-solid form. “I hail from Elysium, a planet of energy and light. It is an honor to meet you, wise ones of the sea.” The Aquarians, now at ease with this strange new visitor, welcomed Sylphora and offered to share their knowledge of the oceans and the delicate balance that sustained their world. In turn, Sylphora shared tales of the stars, of boundless galaxies, and the underlying thread that wove together all forms of life. With the Aquarians' help, she learned to master the art of stabilizing her form in water, becoming a bridge between the soft fluidity of the sea and the firm resolve of her own world. Days passed in the exchange of wisdom and friendship, and Sylphora found a deep connection with the marine inhabitants of Azurea. When it came time for her to venture back to the stars, the Aquarians gathered to bid her farewell, their voices creating a haunting melody that echoed through the deep. “You are always welcome here, Sylphora of Elysium,” Liria intoned, her eyes gleaming with affection. “Should you ever find yourself becoming formless, remember our waters, and let them guide you back to your true self.” Sylphora, her form now steady and radiant once more, dipped her head in gratitude. She morphed into a streamlined shape, perfect for traversing the cosmos, and ascended from the ocean depths into the sky. As she journeyed onward, a trail of cyan light reflecting in her wake, Sylphora held within her a new understanding—the acceptance of the formless and the form, the appreciation of stabilizing one's self amidst new environments, and the promise of friendship that spanned the breadth of planets and seas."},{"prompt":"CREER UN NOTEBOOK PHYTON POUR LA SIMULATION D’UN MOUVEMENT VIBRATOIRE A 1 DDL Considerez un systeme vibrant avec amrtissement et excite par une force periodique(cas general, pas forcement sinusoidal) .

So \\"dou\\" translates to \\"I give.\\" In this context, it's being used figuratively to mean offering or extending something to someone. - \\"as boas-vindas\\" - This is a fixed expression in Portuguese that means \\"the welcome.\\" \\"Boas-vindas\\" is a compound noun (with \\"boas\\" meaning \\"good\\" and \\"vindas\\" meaning \\"comings\\" or \\"arrivals\\") that translates to \\"welcoming\\" or \\"greeting.\\" When you say you are \\"dando as boas-vindas,\\" you are extending a warm reception to someone. - \\"a todos vocês\\" - This phrase consists of \\"a todos,\\" meaning \\"to all,\\" and \\"vocês,\\" which is the second-person plural pronoun \\"you\\" in English. It expresses that the welcome is being offered to everyone in the group being addressed. The phrase \\"que dou as boas-vindas a todos vocês,\\" therefore, translates into English as \\"that I extend a warm welcome to all of you,\\" implying that the speaker is offering a warm and cordial reception to every individual in the audience (the students, in this case). It is a standard and polite way to welcome a group of people and is often used at the beginning of a course, speech, or formal gathering to make participants feel acknowledged and valued."},{"prompt":"\\" Estamos prestes a iniciar\\" explain please and make it a detailed breakdown","completion":"The phrase \\"Estamos prestes a iniciar\\" is Portuguese and can be broken down into its components for a detailed explanation: - \\"Estamos\\" - This word is the first-person plural of the verb \\"estar,\\" which means \\"to be\\" in English, in the present indicative tense. It translates as \\"we are.\\" It indicates the current state or condition of the subject, which in this case is the speaker and the group included by \\"we\\" (probably the instructor and the students). - \\"prestes\\" - This term translates to \\"about\\". It is an adjective that indicates being on the verge of or very close to doing something. When used with \\"a,\\" it forms a construction that is similar to the English \\"about to\\" or \\"on the verge of.\\" - \\"a iniciar\\" - This is a combination of the preposition \\"a,\\" which can be understood as \\"to\\" in this context, followed by the infinitive verb \\"iniciar,\\" which means \\"to begin\\" or \\"to start.\\" When combined, the phrase \\"Estamos prestes a iniciar\\" translates to \\"We are about to begin\\" or \\"We are on the verge of starting\\" in English. The phrase communicates that the speaker, along with the group they are addressing, are moments away from commencing an activity or event—in this context, most likely the course mentioned earlier in the original message. It creates a sense of anticipation and immediacy, implying that the beginning of the course is imminent."},{"prompt":"\\" Será uma oportunidade única para conhecermos melhor as tradições, a história e os costumes que tornam o Brasil um país tão rico e diversificado.\\"","completion":"The Portuguese sentence you provided translates to: \\"It will be a unique opportunity to better understand the traditions, history, and customs that make Brazil such a rich and diverse country.\\" Let's break down the sentence: - \\"Será\\" - This verb is the future tense of the verb \\"ser\\" (to be) for the third person singular, which translates to \\"it will be.\\" It's indicating a future event or condition. - \\"uma oportunidade única\\" - This phrase means \\"a unique opportunity.” \\"Uma\\" is the feminine indefinite article \\"a,\\" \\"oportunidade\\" means \\"opportunity,\\" and \\"única\\" translates to \\"unique,\\" specifying that the opportunity is one of a kind or special. - \\"para conhecermos\\" - The word \\"para\\" translates as \\"to,\\" indicating a purpose or objective, and \\"conhecermos\\" is the first-person plural (inclusive \\"we\\") of the infinitive verb \\"conhecer\\" in the future subjunctive tense, meaning \\"to know\\" or \\"to become acquainted with.\\" Together, \\"para conhecermos\\" could be interpreted as \\"for us to get to know\\" or \\"in order to understand.” - \\"melhor\\" - This word means \\"better.\\" It’s serving as an adverb to \\"conhecermos,\\" enhancing the verb to indicate a deeper or more thorough understanding. - \\"as tradições, a história e os costumes\\" - This segment lists the objects of the opportunity and translates to \\"the traditions, history, and customs.\\" It enumerates the specific aspects of Brazil that participants will explore. - \\"que tornam o Brasil\\" - \\"Que\\" is a relative pronoun translating to \\"that,\\" and \\"tornam\\" is the third person plural of the present indicative tense of the verb \\"tornar,\\" meaning \\"to make\\" or “to turn.” So \\"que tornam o Brasil\\" can be translated as \\"that make Brazil.\\" - \\"um país tão rico e diversificado\\" - This descriptive phrase means \\"a country so rich and diverse.\\" \\"Um país\\" means \\"a country,\\" \\"tão\\" translates to \\"so,\\" indicating the extent, \\"rico\\" means \\"rich,\\" in the sense of being full or abundant, not necessarily wealthy, and \\"diversificado\\" means \\"diverse\\" or \\"varied.\\" Putting it all together, the sentence is conveying that the course will present a special chance for the participants (\\"we\\") to deepen their understanding of the cultural elements—traditions, history, and customs—that contribute to making Brazil a country characterized by great richness and diversity."},{"prompt":"\\" Ao longo das aulas, teremos a chance de aprender juntos e compartilhar experiências, enriquecendo ainda mais nosso conhecimento e apreciação pela cultura brasileira.\\"","completion":"The Portuguese sentence you've provided translates to English as: \\"Throughout the classes, we will have the chance to learn together and share experiences, further enriching our knowledge and appreciation for Brazilian culture.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of each part of the sentence: - \\"Ao longo das aulas,\\" - This phrase can be dissected into \\"ao longo de,\\" which means \\"throughout\\" or \\"over the course of,\\" and \\"das aulas,\\" which is a combination of \\"das\\" (the contraction of the preposition \\"de\\" and the definite article \\"as,\\" translating to \\"of the\\") and \\"aulas,\\" which means \\"classes.\\" Together, \\"Ao longo das aulas,\\" indicates what will happen during or over the span of the classes. - \\"teremos a chance de aprender juntos\\" - \\"Teremos\\" is the first-person plural of the future indicative of the verb \\"ter,\\" meaning \\"we will have.\\" \\"A chance de\\" translates to \\"the chance to\\" or \\"the opportunity to,\\" and \\"aprender juntos\\" combines \\"aprender,\\" which means \\"to learn,\\" with \\"juntos,\\" meaning \\"together.\\" This part of the sentence expresses that the group will have an opportunity to learn collectively. - \\"e compartilhar experiências,\\" - \\"E\\" is the conjunction \\"and\\" in English, linking the ideas of learning together and sharing experiences. \\"Compartilhar\\" is the verb \\"to share,\\" and \\"experiências\\" means \\"experiences.\\" This indicates that part of the learning process will involve exchanging personal experiences amongst the group. - \\"enriquecendo ainda mais nosso conhecimento\\" - This is a participial phrase that starts with \\"enriquecendo,\\" which is the present participle of \\"enriquecer,\\" meaning \\"enriching.\\" \\"Ainda mais\\" translates to \\"even more,\\" indicating that this process will amplify or enhance something. \\"Nosso conhecimento\\" means \\"our knowledge,\\" so this phrase together conveys that through the classes, the shared learnings and experiences will serve to further enrich the participants' knowledge. - \\"e apreciação pela cultura brasileira.\\" - Following the pattern, \\"e\\" again means \\"and.\\" \\"Apreciação\\" is \\"appreciation,\\" which is preceded by \\"pela,\\" the contraction of \\"por\\" (for) and \\"a\\" (the feminine definite article \\"the\\"), together meaning \\"for the.\\" \\"Cultura brasileira\\" translates to \\"Brazilian culture.\\" Thus, this last part emphasizes that the enrichment will be not only in terms of knowledge but also in terms of an increasing appreciation for the culture of Brazil. In summary, the sentence is an optimistic overview of what the students can expect from the course: a collaborative learning experience that spans throughout the duration of the classes, offering various opportunities to both gain and contribute knowledge, which will serve to deepen and enhance their collective understanding and appreciation of the many facets of Brazilian culture."},{"prompt":"\\" Estou ansioso para começar esta jornada com vocês e para as descobertas que faremos juntos ao longo do caminho. Sejam todos muito bem-vindos! Atenciosamente, Professor Raphael\\"","completion":"The provided Portuguese text translates to English as: \\"I am eager to start this journey with you and for the discoveries we will make together along the way. A warm welcome to everyone! Sincerely, Professor Raphael\\" Let's break down each part of the message for more detail: - \\"Estou ansioso para começar esta jornada com vocês\\" – \\"Estou ansioso\\" means \\"I am eager\\" or \\"I am looking forward,\\" indicating anticipation or excitement on the part of the speaker. \\"Para começar\\" translates to \\"to start.\\" \\"Esta jornada\\" means \\"this journey,\\" referring to the course or the experience that is about to begin. \\"Com vocês\\" means \\"with you,\\" indicating that this journey is a collaborative one with the students. - \\"e para as descobertas que faremos juntos ao longo do caminho\\" – \\"E\\" means \\"and,\\" connecting the previous thought. \\"Para as descobertas\\" translates to \\"for the discoveries.\\" \\"Que faremos juntos\\" can be broken down into \\"que\\" meaning \\"that,\\" \\"faremos\\" being the first-person plural future indicative of \\"fazer\\" (to do/make), translating to \\"we will make,\\" and \\"juntos\\" meaning \\"together.\\" \\"Ao longo do caminho\\" translates to \\"along the way.\\" This phrase communicates an anticipation of shared learning experiences throughout the course's duration. - \\"Sejam todos muito bem-vindos!\\" - \\"Sejam\\" is the second-person plural imperative form of \\"ser\\" (to be), here used to convey a welcoming sentiment. \\"Todos\\" means \\"all,\\" \\"muito\\" translates as \\"very,\\" and \\"bem-vindos\\" is the equivalent of \\"welcome\\" in English. Put together, \\"Sejam todos muito bem-vindos!\\" functions as an enthusiastic and inclusive greeting, expressing \\"You are all very welcome!\\" - \\"Atenciosamente,\\" - This is a closing salutation that translates to \\"Sincerely,\\" commonly used at the end of formal correspondence in Portuguese to signal politeness and respect before signing off with one's name. - \\"Professor Raphael\\" - This is simply the name of the person sending the message, preceded by their title, \\"Professor,\\" which indicates that Raphael is the teacher or academic instructor of the course. Overall, the message conveys Professor Raphael's excitement and readiness to begin a collaborative and exploratory learning experience with the students. The professor expresses a warm welcome to everyone and emphasizes the shared anticipation of the knowledge and understanding that will be gained throughout the course's journey."},{"prompt":"Boas-vindas vs brm-vindos explain please","completion":"Both \\"boas-vindas\\" and \\"bem-vindos\\" are Portuguese expressions related to welcoming someone, but they are used in slightly different contexts and have different grammatical roles. **Boas-vindas**: - This is a noun phrase, with \\"boas\\" meaning \\"good\\" and \\"vindas\\" meaning \\"comings\\" or \\"arrivals\\". - \\"Boas-vindas\\" is often used as a feminine plural noun and denotes the act of welcoming or the greeting itself. - It can be used in various contexts, whether someone is welcomed into a home, a group, an organization, etc. - Example use: \\"Daremos as boas-vindas aos novos alunos na próxima semana.\\" (We will give a welcome to the new students next week.) **Bem-vindos**: - This is an interjection or a greeting phrase, where \\"bem\\" means \\"well\\" and \\"vindos\\" is the past participle of \\"vir,\\" meaning \\"come.\\" When combined, \\"bem-vindos\\" literally means \\"well come,\\" which is the equivalent of \\"welcome\\" in English. - \\"Bem-vindos\\" is used as the masculine plural form. For feminine plural, you would use \\"bem-vindas\\"; for singular masculine, \\"bem-vindo\\"; and for singular feminine, \\"bem-vinda.\\" - It is commonly used to greet a person or group of people arriving at a location or event. - Example use: \\"Bem-vindos ao nosso evento!\\" (Welcome to our event!) In essence: - Use \\"boas-vindas\\" when you are referring to the greeting itself (noun) – for example, when talking about the process or action of welcoming someone. - Use \\"bem-vindos\\" when you are directly welcoming someone or some group (adjective or interjection) – for example, when directly addressing new arrivals saying they are welcome."},{"prompt":"\\"Será uma oportunidade única para conhecermos melhor as tradições\\" could you give me three possible translations in spanish that sounds natural for native spanish speakers and tell me why","completion":"Certainly! Here are three potential translations in Spanish for the phrase \\"Será uma oportunidade única para conhecermos melhor as tradições\\" along with explanations for why they would sound natural to native Spanish speakers: 1. \\"Será una oportunidad única para conocer mejor las tradiciones.\\" - This translation maintains a very close syntactical and lexical resemblance to the original Portuguese phrasing. It uses \\"será\\" (future tense of \\"ser\\" - to be), which aligns with \\"Será\\" in Portuguese, suggesting a future occurrence. \\"Una oportunidad única\\" translates directly to \\"a unique opportunity,\\" and it's a common Spanish phrase. The construction \\"para conocer mejor\\" mirrors \\"para conhecermos melhor,\\" effectively communicating the idea of improving or deepening knowledge. \\"Las tradiciones\\" is a straightforward translation of \\"as tradições.\\" 2. \\"Será una ocasión irrepetible para profundizar en las tradiciones.\\" - In this translation, \\"ocasión irrepetible\\" conveys the idea of a unique opportunity, emphasizing its one-time nature, which can resonate well with native speakers by stressing the exclusivity of the chance being presented. \\"Para profundizar en\\" translates to \\"to delve deeper into\\" or \\"to deepen,\\" giving the sentence a slightly different nuance by highlighting the depth of understanding being sought. \\"Las tradiciones\\" remains consistent as the object of the sentence. 3. \\"Tendremos una oportunidad inigualable para aprender más acerca de las tradiciones.\\" - Here, \\"tendremos\\" is the future indicative form of \\"tener\\" (to have), which, while slightly different from \\"será,\\" is also a natural way to express a future event in Spanish. \\"Oportunidad inigualable\\" equates to an unparalleled or matchless opportunity, a similarly strong expression as \\"única\\" but with a slightly different emphasis on its matchlessness. \\"Para aprender más acerca de\\" is longer and less direct than \\"para conocer mejor,\\" but it's a common phrase in Spanish that simplifies \\"conhecermos melhor,\\" making it clearer and more explicit about the objective of learning. \\"Las tradiciones\\" again remains unchanged. Each of these translations would sound natural to Spanish speakers because they use familiar structures and word choices to convey the same sentiment of excitement and the anticipation of a unique learning experience. They consider the subtle variations in tone and style that exist between Portuguese and Spanish, ensuring that the message is culturally and linguistically appropriate."},{"prompt":"If conhecermos is in subjunctive yhen how it would be in Spanish?","completion":"In Portuguese, \\"conhecermos\\" in the phrase \\"Será uma oportunidade única para conhecermos melhor as tradições\\" is not in the subjunctive mood. It's actually in the infinitive form, as part of the infinitive phrase used to express a purpose or intention—analogous to the English usage of \\"to\\" + verb (for example, \\"to learn\\"). In this case, it's combined with \\"para\\" to indicate the purpose of the opportunity mentioned. In Spanish, however, there doesn't exist a future subjunctive form that is regularly used in modern language. The future subjunctive exists but is archaic and virtually never seen in contemporary Spanish. Instead, the present subjunctive is used for most subjunctive needs, including those looking to the future. So, if you wish to retain the subjunctive mood in a translated sentence to Spanish where it reflects uncertainty, possibility, or a non-factual future occurrence, you would use the present subjunctive, even for future events. Given this context, the subjunctive isn't required here because the opportunity is presented as a future certainty. However, if you need an example where the subjunctive mood in Spanish is appropriate for a similar context, you might say: - \\"Espero que tengamos la oportunidad de conocer mejor las tradiciones.\\" (I hope that we have the opportunity to better understand the traditions.) In this sentence, \\"tengamos\\" is the present subjunctive form of \\"tener\\" (to have) because the speaker is expressing a hope, which invokes the subjunctive mood in Spanish. For the original sentence \\"Será uma oportunidade única para conhecermos melhor as tradições\\", the corresponding Spanish translation maintaining the indicative future would be: - \\"Será una oportunidad única para conocer mejor las tradiciones.\\" Here \\"conocer\\" is an infinitive verb used similarly to \\"conhecermos\\" in the Portuguese sentence, acting as the action to be carried out in the future and expressing intention or purpose—hence the indicative, not the subjunctive, is appropriate."},{"prompt":"But conhecermos ends in mos, is not an infinitive","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. You are correct; \\"conhecermos\\" ending with \\"-mos\\" indeed indicates that it is not the infinitive form, but rather the first-person plural of the verb \\"conhecer\\" in the present subjunctive or the personal infinitive. Portuguese uses the personal infinitive, a unique form where the infinitive is inflected to agree with the subject in both number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, or third). In this phrase, \\"para conhecermos melhor as tradições,\\" the use of \\"conhecermos\\" is actually a personal infinitive construction that indicates an action to be taken by \\"us\\" (nosotros/nosotras in Spanish), in the future. Yet, it still retains a shade of purpose, intention, or potentiality, which aligns with the subjunctive mood in general. In contrast, Spanish does not have a personal infinitive, and the equivalent meaning is usually conveyed using the subjunctive mood, especially when expressing doubt, uncertainty, desire, or conjecture within a subordinate clause introduced by \\"para que.\\" Given this explanation, if we were to translate the phrase to Spanish while maintaining the subjunctive mood to reflect the intended meaning of potentiality or purpose, we could use the present subjunctive after \\"para que\\" (so that we), as follows: 1. \\"Será una oportunidad única para que conozcamos mejor las tradiciones.\\" - \\"para que conozcamos\\" expresses the purpose or intention for \\"us\\" to get to know the traditions better. 2. \\"Será una oportunidad única para que aprendamos más sobre las tradiciones.\\" - A variant that uses \\"aprendamos\\" (we learn) instead of \\"conozcamos\\" (we get to know). 3. \\"Será una oportunidad única para que descubramos más acerca de las tradiciones.\\" - \\"descubramos\\" (we discover) is another alternative that conveys the idea of exploration or finding out about something in depth. In all these translations, the subjunctive mood is appropriately used with \\"para que,\\" indicating an intention or potential action rather than a certainty. It retains the collective sense of the original Portuguese phrase, indicating a group action involving the speaker and the listeners."},{"prompt":"Write a story about a man who feels guilty after a rabbit and hedgehog died","completion":"Once there was a man named Michael who lived in a small village surrounded by lush green forests. Michael was an avid animal lover and enjoyed spending time in nature, observing the wildlife that called the woods their home. One day, while he was out on a walk, Michael came across a rabbit caught in a trap that had been set by a hunter. The poor creature was struggling to free itself, but its efforts were in vain. Without hesitation, Michael rushed to the rabbit’s aid and carefully released it from the trap. The rabbit, grateful for his help, hopped away into the safety of the underbrush. Feeling proud of his actions, Michael continued his walk through the forest. However, as he turned a corner, he stumbled upon a hedgehog lying on the ground, seemingly lifeless. His heart sank as he realized that the hedgehog had fallen victim to a careless driver who had run over it on the road. Tears welled up in Michael’s eyes as he knelt beside the hedgehog, feeling an overwhelming sense of guilt wash over him. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he could have done something to prevent the hedgehog’s untimely death. He cursed himself for not being more vigilant and aware of his surroundings. As he sat there, grieving for the loss of the innocent creatures, Michael made a vow to always be more mindful and compassionate towards the animals he shared the forest with. He promised to do everything in his power to protect and care for them, to ensure that no more harm would come to them under his watch. From that day on, Michael dedicated himself to the preservation of the wildlife in the forest. He volunteered at local animal shelters, helped to clean up litter and debris that could harm the animals, and even organized campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of coexisting peacefully with nature. Though he could never erase the memory of the rabbit and hedgehog’s deaths, Michael found solace in knowing that he was making a positive impact on the world around him. And as he looked out at the vast expanse of the forest, teeming with life and vitality, he knew that his efforts were not in vain. The animals of the forest would forever have a guardian in him."},{"prompt":"請作一個童話，和三體第三集提及的畫家及魔法差不多，200字","completion":"從前，有一位畫家名叫艾德加，他有一雙神奇的畫筆，只要他畫下的東西都會變成真的。有一天，一隻邪惡的魔王入侵了村莊，讓所有人都陷入恐懼之中。 艾德加決定利用他的畫筆來幫助村民。他畫下一隻巨大的龍，讓牠帶領村民們對抗魔王。在龍的幫助下，村民們成功擊敗了魔王，恢復了和平。 從此以後，艾德加成為了村莊的英雄，人們都對他充滿敬畏。但是艾德加知道，這些力量是來自於他勇氣和善良的心，而不單單只是畫筆的魔法所賦予的。最終，他學會了用自己的勇氣和善良來保護村莊，讓每個人都能享受和平與幸福的生活。"},{"prompt":"請作一個故事，跟龍珠差不多，200字","completion":"在一個遙遠的世界，存在著七龍珠，擁有著無盡的力量。主角是一名年輕的冒險家，他名叫凱恩，決心尋找七龍珠，實現自己的願望。 凱恩在冒險的途中結識了一位智慧的老者，他告訴凱恩七龍珠的力量可以讓人實現任何願望，但同時也會引起世界的動盪。凱恩不畏艱險，堅信他可以利用這股力量造福世界。 途中，凱恩遇到了許多挑戰和敵人，但他努力不懈，克服了一切困難，最終集齊了七龍珠。當他使出願望時，他祈求的是讓這個世界充滿和平與愛。 七龍珠的神奇力量落下一片祥和，人們重新找回了希望與喜悅。凱恩成為了這個世界的英雄，人們永遠記得他為大家帶來的和平和幸福。"},{"prompt":"請作一個故事，跟母上攻略差不多，200字","completion":"在一個古老的王國中，有一位美麗而強大的女王，她的名字叫做艾莉絲。艾莉絲是一位傾國傾城的女王，但她的心卻一直空虛寂寞。 有一天，一名勇敢的年輕騎士受命前來攻佔艾莉絲女王的城堡。然而，當他一見到艾莉絲的美麗與孤獨時，他的心便被她所吸引。 在城堡的攻守之間，艾莉絲和年輕騎士之間產生了微妙的情愫。漸漸地，他們彼此了解對方的內心，艾莉絲也發現自己深深愛上了這位年輕的騎士。 最終，城堡攻下，但年輕騎士卻選擇留在了艾莉絲身旁，成為了她的摯愛。他們之間的愛情像是一場勝利的征程，將永遠繼續在這個王國中綻放。"},{"prompt":"請作一個故事，跟東京攻略差不多，200字","completion":"在一個現代都市中，有著一座繁華的城市名為新京都。這座城市有一位年輕的旅行者名叫美優，她來到這座城市探索並體驗各種新奇的事物。 美優在新京都遇到了一群友善且熱情的當地人，他們帶著美優遊覽城市的各個角落，品嘗當地的美食和文化。在這段旅程中，美優漸漸喜歡上這座城市，並與新的朋友們建立了深厚的情誼。 在新京都的探險中，美優也遇到了一位特別的當地人，他名叫櫻太。櫻太給予了美優許多意外的驚喜和感動，讓她的旅程變得更加豐富與難忘。 最終，美優離開新京都，帶著對這個城市美好回憶和感激之心回到了家鄉。新京都成了她心中永遠難以忘懷的一段經歷，而櫻太則成為了美優心中特別的存在。"},{"prompt":"請作一個故事，跟三体差不多，200字","completion":"在一個未來科技高度發達的世界，人類接觸到了一個名為「星際之門」的神秘外星科技。這個星際之門能夠連接到遠方的星球，帶來了人類前所未有的探索與機會。 然而，隨著人類在星際之門探索的深入，他們發現了一個陰謀：外星文明正蠶食著人類的資源，企圖毀滅地球。一股強大的力量影響著人類，使得人類面臨著重大的挑戰。 一群傑出的科學家和戰士開始聯手對抗外星勢力，他們利用科技與智慧，努力保護地球和人類的未來。在這場驚心動魄的對抗中，人類不僅面臨著生存的考驗，也發現了自身的脆弱和強大。 最終，人類以團結的力量，成功擊退了外星勢力，守護著地球的和平。這場挑戰讓人類更加意識到科技的力量與危險，也讓他們更加珍惜和守護著這個珍貴的家園。"},{"prompt":"請作一個故事，主角是蔣介石及蔡英文，張召忠差不多，200字","completion":"蔣介石和蔡英文一直是兩位截然不同的政治領袖，他們的信念和價值觀常常相左。當一次外星入侵威脅到台灣時，這兩位領袖被迫聯手抵抗來自外太空的敵人。 在戰爭的進程中，蔣介石展現出他的軍事統帥才能，成功組織起台灣的國軍，對抗外星入侵者。而蔡英文則展現出了她的智慧和決斷，指揮著政府的各項應對措施。 張召忠，作為一位著名的軍事專家，也加入了他們的陣營，為台灣的防禦策略提供寶貴的建議。三人攜手合作，展現出無比的團結和合作精神，為了捍衛台灣的和平與獨立而努力奮戰。 最終，在眾人的共同努力下，外星入侵者被擊退，台灣成功守住了自己的領土。這場戰役不僅讓人們更加團結，也讓蔣介石、蔡英文和張召忠的關係變得更加和諧與共融。"},{"prompt":"張召忠忽悠了蔡英文","completion":"在一個政治氛圍緊張的時刻，張召忠向蔡英文提出了一個看似有利的策略，忽悠她相信外星入侵是一場造假的陰謀。蔡英文被誤導，在戰略上採取了錯誤的舉措，使得台灣陷入了更加危險的局面。 隨著外星入侵勢力逐漸增強，蔡英文意識到自己被欺騙，感到無比懊悔和愧疚。她決定重新審視自己的決策，並尋求其他領袖和專家的幫助來領導對抗外星入侵的戰爭。 在重回正軌的指導下，台灣政府和軍隊重新組織起來，與外星入侵者展開激烈的對抗。蔡英文深刻了解到信任和智慧的重要性，並努力挽回自己的過失，保護台灣的和平與安全。 這場危機也讓蔡英文更加謹慎和謙虛，學會了從失誤中吸取教訓，領導台灣走向更加穩固和繁榮的未來。張召忠也意識到自己的錯誤，並決定以實質行動來彌補自己的過錯。"},{"prompt":"改結局蔡英文最後輸了","completion":"在外星入侵的危機中，蔡英文遭遇到張召忠的欺騙，導致台灣陷入困境。在極度失望和自責之際，蔡英文意識到必須承擔自己的過失，並決定勇敢面對外星入侵者。 儘管台灣面臨巨大威脅，蔡英文不放棄抵抗，她擔起領導者的責任，努力調動社會力量，組織防線。雖然情勢危急，但蔡英文依然堅決帶領人民團結抗敵，奮力捍衛台灣的獨立與安全。 最終，經過激烈的戰鬥，台灣成功擊退了外星入侵者，重建起受損的國家。雖然過程充滿艱辛，但蔡英文在失敗中尋找到了成長的關鍵，成為了更加堅強和睿智的領袖，引領台灣走向更加光明的未來。張召忠也在戰後反省自己的行為，努力彌補過失，與蔡英文攜手重建台灣。"},{"prompt":"蔡英文是導致輸的原因","completion":"在外星入侵的危機中，蔡英文受到張召忠的欺騙，導致她傾向相信外星入侵是一場造假的陰謀，誤導了對外星入侵的判斷。這導致了策略上的錯誤判斷和行為的錯誤，最終使得台灣陷入困境。 蔡英文在意識到自己的錯誤後，感到極度懊悔和自責。雖然她隨後展示出勇氣和決心，重新領導台灣對抗外星入侵勢力，但過於晚發現真相依然對台灣的戰局產生了嚴重影響。 最終，台灣在外星入侵者的強大壓力下，無法扭轉戰局，蔡英文的錯誤判斷導致了最終的失敗。這場敗仗讓蔡英文深刻認識到領導者的責任和重要性，未來將更加謹慎謙虛處事，以確保台灣的安全和繁榮。同时，這也成為台灣人民反省反思的契機，共同迎接未來的挑戰。"},{"prompt":"蔡英文最後跟馬英九告白，但被拒絕，凌小東出現，最後蔡英文愛上了凌小更","completion":"在外星入侵的危機中，蔡英文意識到自己曾經的判斷錯誤，因此向馬英九坦白自己的感受，但卻遭到了馬英九的拒絕。受到拒絕的打擊讓蔡英文感到沮喪，這時，一名名叫凌小東的年輕科學家出現在她的生活中。 凌小東是一位擁有豐富知識和敏銳洞察力的科學家，他即使在危急時刻也展現出非凡的勇氣和智慧。蔡英文被他的才華和魅力所吸引，漸漸地對他產生了好奇和愛慕之情。 在共同對抗外星入侵者的過程中，蔡英文和凌小東互相扶持，一同面對生死考驗。他們之間的合作與理解日益加深，最終在這場生死危機中，蔡英文意識到自己對凌小東的感情已經超越了友情，而是深深地愛上了他。 最終，外星入侵者被擊退，台灣重獲自由和和平。蔡英文和凌小東攜手走過困難時刻，他們的愛情也在戰火的熔爐中得以煉成，成為這場危機中珍貴的收穫和記憶。"},{"prompt":"但凌小東有自己的愛人，再度拋棄蔡蔡子","completion":"在外星入侵的危機中，儘管蔡英文對凌小東產生了真摯的感情，但凌小東卻已經和其他人有了愛情。當凌小東的愛人在危機中需要他的支持時，他毅然拋棄了蔡英文並投入到愛人的身旁。 這一次的拒絕令蔡英文感到極度痛苦和失落，她深深瞭解到愛情並非一帆風順，時常充滿挑戰和妥協。即使失去了凌小東，但蔡英文也學會在逆境中堅強和成長。 在外星入侵危機經歷後，蔡英文回歸到領導台灣的重任中，她以更加堅定和睿智的姿態來應對未來的挑戰。儘管心有遺憾，但蔡英文明白每個人都有自己的選擇，她會堅強不屈，繼續為台灣的繁榮和和平而努力奮鬥。这也是一个充满挑战和成长的历程。"},{"prompt":"ffmpeg: error while loading shared libraries: libopenh264.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory FATAL: command failed","completion":"The error you're seeing indicates that FFmpeg is trying to use the \`libopenh264.so.5\` library, but it cannot find it.

For other systems, like CentOS or Fedora, you would use the \`yum\` or \`dnf\` package manager, respectively. 2. **Install FFmpeg with Static Libraries**: Alternatively, you could opt for a version of FFmpeg that has been statically compiled with the necessary libraries. This would not require you to install \`libopenh264\` separately. Pre-compiled static builds of FFmpeg can be downloaded from various sources. 3. **Set \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\`**: If you have OpenH264 installed in a non-standard directory, you might need to inform your system where to find the library. You can do this by setting the \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` environment variable: \`\`\`bash export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/libraries:LD_LIBRARY_PATH \`\`\` Replace \`/path/to/your/libraries\` with the actual path where \`libopenh264.so.5\` is located. 4. **Update the Dynamic Linker Run-Time Bindings**: After installing a new library, the system's dynamic linker might need to be updated to know about the new library. On many systems, this is done using the \`ldconfig\` command: \`\`\`bash sudo ldconfig \`\`\` 5. **Reinstall FFmpeg**: It's possible that your FFmpeg installation is not set up correctly. Reinstalling FFmpeg could potentially solve the problem, especially if you use an installation method that accounts for all necessary dependencies. \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get remove --purge ffmpeg sudo apt-get install ffmpeg \`\`\` Remember to replace the use of \`apt-get\` with the appropriate package management command for your specific Linux distribution. After completing one or more of the above steps, try running FFmpeg again to see if the issue has been resolved."},{"prompt":"Скажи кратко по, Риккетсии, Спирохеты, Хламидии, Микоплазмы, Актиномицеты","completion":"**Риккетсии** - это группа облигатно внутриклеточных паразитических бактерий. Риккетсии вызывают такие заболевания, как сыпной тиф, ку-лихорадка и тиф Rocky Mountain. Риккетсиозы обычно передаются через укусы насекомых, например, клещей и вошей. **Спирохеты** - это группа бактерий, имеющих спиралевидную форму и способные к активному движению благодаря жгутикам. К этой группе относятся возбудители таких заболеваний, как сифилис (Treponema pallidum), болезнь Лайма (Borrelia burgdorferi) и рецидивирующий лихорадочный тиф (Borrelia recurrentis). **Хламидии** - это еще одна группа облигатно внутриклеточных паразитов, вызывающих широкий спектр заболеваний у людей и животных. К ним относятся хламидиоз (Chlamydia trachomatis), который может вызывать урогенитальные инфекции, конъюнктивит и трахому, и пситтакоз (Chlamydia psittaci), болезнь передающаяся от птиц. **Микоплазмы** - это мельчайшие бактерии, лишенные клеточной стенки, что делает их устойчивыми к многим антибиотикам, действующим на клеточную стенку. Микоплазмы вызывают респираторные и урогенитальные инфекции, в том числе пневмонию (Mycoplasma pneumoniae) и уретрит (Mycoplasma genitalium). **Актиномицеты** - это группа грамположительных бактерий, которые часто обладают ветвистой формой, напоминающей грибы.

As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, CoinMarketCap provides an API that can be used to retrieve Bitcoin dominance data. However, please note that accessing historical data could require a paid subscription to their API services. Below is a Python example using the free CoinGecko API to download historical data for Bitcoin dominance and export it to a CSV file. CoinGecko is an alternative to CoinMarketCap and provides a simple API for cryptocurrency data. \`\`\`python import requests import csv from datetime import datetime # Define the CoinGecko API endpoint for global cryptocurrency data url = \\"https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/global\\" # Make the API request response = requests.get(url) data = response.json() # Check if the request was successful if response.status_code == 200: # Extracting Bitcoin dominance data bitcoin_dominance_percentage = data['data']['market_cap_percentage']['btc'] current_time = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') # Write to CSV file csv_filename = 'bitcoin_dominance.csv' with open(csv_filename, mode='a', newline='') as file: csv_writer = csv.writer(file) # Write the header if the file is empty if file.tell() == 0: csv_writer.writerow(['Timestamp', 'Bitcoin Dominance Percentage']) # Write the data csv_writer.writerow([current_time, bitcoin_dominance_percentage]) print(f\\"Bitcoin dominance data successfully written to {csv_filename}.\\") else: print(\\"Failed to retrieve data from CoinGecko API.\\") \`\`\` This script retrieves the latest Bitcoin dominance data and stores it in a CSV file along with the timestamp. If you want historical daily data, you might have to call an API that provides historical Bitcoin dominance data and iterate over the dates you want to retrieve. Currently, CoinGecko's API does not provide an endpoint specifically for historical Bitcoin dominance data, and their market data may not extend far back in time for detailed historical analysis. If you need extensive historical data, you may need to use a paid service or a different API. Always familiarize yourself with the API's terms of service before using it, as excessive requests or misuse can lead to rate limiting or account suspension. Remember that you will need to install the \`requests\` module if it is not already installed on your system.

Be very specific with measurements and equipments for the expirement","completion":"Creating an eco-friendly DIY bag from an existing plastic bag is a form of upcycling that can extend the life of the plastic and reduce waste. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a simple tote bag with the assumption that you have an average-sized plastic grocery bag. Adjust the dimensions if your plastic bag is significantly larger or smaller. **Materials**: - A plastic grocery bag (preferably a strong one, like a reusable shopping bag) - Scissors - Duct tape or strong adhesive tape (fabric tape can also be used for more durability and better look) - A ruler or measuring tape - An iron - Parchment paper - Needle and thread (or a sewing machine) - A piece of cloth (optional, for reinforcing the handles) **Instructions**: 1. **Prepare Your Work Area**: - Clean a flat surface where you can lay out the plastic bag. 2. **Clean the Plastic Bag**: - Make sure the plastic bag is clean and dry. If necessary, wash it with soap and water, rinse it thoroughly, and allow it to dry before you begin. 3. **Cut the Plastic Bag**: - Lay the plastic bag flat on the working surface. - Straighten out the plastic bag and smooth out any wrinkles. - Cut off the handles and the seams at the bottom of the bag to create a large rectangle. 4. **Strengthen the Bag (optional)**: - To make the bag more durable, you can fuse layers of plastic together. Use an iron on a low to medium setting and place parchment paper between the iron and the plastic to prevent melting onto the iron. - Lay the plastic flat between two sheets of parchment paper and gently run the warm iron over it, fusing the layers together. Be careful not to overheat. - Let it cool before moving on to the next step. 5. **Create New Handles**: - From the leftover material (the cut-off handles and bottom piece), cut two strips for the new handles. A recommended size is 2 inches wide and about 15 inches long, but this size can be adjusted based on preference. - Strengthen these strips by fusing them with the iron and parchment paper method described above. 6. **Fold and Tape the Bag**: - Fold the large rectangle in half, matching up the edges where the bottom of the bag used to be. - Use the duct tape or adhesive tape to secure the edges and form the sides of your new bag. Be sure to leave the top open. For a cleaner finish and more durable hold, you could opt to sew the edges instead. 7. **Attach Handles**: - If you're using duct tape, tape the ends of each strip to the inside walls of your bag to form loops that will act as handles. The handles should be taped securely, with several inches of the strips inside the bag to provide a strong hold. - For a more durable attachment, you can sew the handles to the bag. If sewing, reinforce the areas where the handles attach to the bag by sewing multiple times or using a piece of cloth on the inside of the bag for added strength. 8. **Finish and Reinforce the Bag**: - To reinforce the bottom of your bag, place a piece of cardboard cut to size inside or fuse additional layers of plastic there. - Fold the top edge of the bag over to the inside and secure it with tape or sewing for a neater look and to prevent fraying. Your DIY eco-friendly bag from a plastic bag is now ready to use! Remember that the strength and durability of the bag will depend on the original plastic bag material and how well the bag is constructed, so be mindful of the weight of items placed in the bag. This project not only recycles a plastic bag but also provides a unique and personal accessory for shopping or carrying items."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

AkinaEntertainments in Osaka sounds like it must have been a well-known player in the entertainment industry during its prime. It's interesting how it dominated for a good five years before such an unusual and dramatic event led to its downfall. Here are a few more prompts I could think of to further elaborate on your studio's story: 1. **Studio Origins**: How was AkinaEntertainments founded? What vision did the founders have? Perhaps they wanted to revolutionize the film industry with a certain genre of movies or new technology. 2. **Achievements**: What kinds of films did AkinaEntertainments produce during its peak? Were there any particularly famous films or iconic moments in cinema that it was known for? 3. **Key Figures**: Who were the key figures behind the studio? You could create a charismatic studio head, a couple of visionary directors, or even star actors associated with the studio's biggest hits. 4. **The Fateful Incident**: How exactly did a random horse get into the studio? This could be a quirky accident or part of a larger story involving sabotage, a disgruntled former employee, or even a bizarre series of coincidences. 5. **Aftermath and Legacy**: After going broke, what happened to the talent and assets of AkinaEntertainments? Did any other studios emerge from its ashes? Perhaps the spirit of AkinaEntertainments lives on in other creative endeavors in Osaka or the wider film industry. 6. **Cultural Impact**: How did the city of Osaka and its inhabitants react to the rise and fall of AkinaEntertainments? Maybe the studio had a significant impact on the local economy or inspired a generation of filmmakers. 7. **Mystique and Myth**: After its downfall, did any myths or urban legends spring up around AkinaEntertainments and the incident with the horse? It might have become folklore, inviting speculation and intrigue. 8. **Potential Revival**: Could there be a possible revival or tribute to AkinaEntertainments in the future? Perhaps a dedicated fan or former employee starts a campaign or crowdfunds to bring back the studio's name or to produce a documentary about its history and sudden demise. Feel free to expand on any of these areas or take the story in a completely new direction. Your fictional movie studio has the potential to be as detailed and nuanced as any real-world company!"},{"prompt":"Their masterpieces include Gone with the Snow (2008) and an Average Day in Tokyo (2011). Gone With The Snow was like a combination of Max Payne and Taxi Driver. Average Day in Tokyo was about a JASDF cadet coming home from finishing flying school.","completion":"AkinaEntertainments certainly had an intriguing lineup with these masterpieces. Both films seem to offer very different experiences, suggesting the studio had a range of capabilities. 1. **Gone with the Snow (2008)**: This film sounds like it was a stylized thriller or noir, perhaps set in a wintry urban landscape judging by the title. With influences from \\"Max Payne\\" and \\"Taxi Driver,\\" it might involve a brooding protagonist on a quest for vengeance or redemption, navigating a corrupt world. It could have been praised for its gritty storytelling, atmospheric cinematography, and intense character study, potentially securing a cult following. 2. **An Average Day in Tokyo (2011)**: This film takes a quieter, more introspective turn, focusing on the life of a JASDF (Japan Air Self-Defense Force) cadet. The narrative might be a slice-of-life drama that contrasts the disciplined life of a military cadet with the bustling and multifaceted metropolis of Tokyo. Such a story could touch on themes of personal ambition, cultural identity, and finding one's place in the world amidst tradition and modernity. Considering these releases, AkinaEntertainments seems to have specialized in films that were both visually and emotionally engaging. They likely had a talent for storytelling that resonated with audiences, which contributed to their fame. The diversity in their filmography would also suggest that the studio had a team of versatile directors, writers, and producers capable of handling different genres with skill and artistic flair. The fictional backstory of the studio's downfall due to a horse wreaking havoc adds a tragicomic note to its history. While audiences and critics might recall the studio's cinematic contributions fondly, the bizarre end adds an air of legend around AkinaEntertainments. This might be the sort of tale cinephiles recount with a mix of nostalgia and disbelief, with some speculating on the 'what ifs' had the studio continued to produce such noteworthy films. In the aftermath, perhaps some of the studio's former staff went on to have remarkable careers elsewhere, carrying on the innovative spirit and cinematic excellence that AkinaEntertainments stood for, despite its untimely end."},{"prompt":"haallo#","completion":"Hello!

Suskirstyk mažomis dalimis.","completion":"# Įvadas: Verbaliniai komunikacijos skirtumai verslo kultūrose yra svarbūs ne tik tarptautinės prekybos ir investicijų derybose, bet ir kasdieniame darbo aplinkoje, kai bendraujama su kolegomis ir klientais iš įvairių pasaulio šalių. Komunikacijos sklandumui užtikrinti svarbu žinoti ir suprasti kultūrines ypatybes ir jų įtaką bendravimo stiliui. # Žodžio galia: - **Tiesioginis ir netiesioginis bendravimas**: Kai kuriose kultūrose (pvz., JAV, Vokietijoje) vertinamas tiesioginis bendravimas, kai aiškiai išsakoma tai, ką žmogus galvoja ar jaučia. Tuo tarpu kitose kultūrose (pvz., Japonijoje, Korėjoje) pirmenybė teikiama netiesioginiam bendravimui, kuris dažnai palieka daugiau tarpusavyje supratimo ir interpretacijos erdvės. - **Aukšto ir žemo konteksto**: Aukšto konteksto kultūrose (pvz., Artimųjų Rytų, Viduržemio jūros regiono šalys) daugiau informacijos perduodama per netiesiogines užuominas, gestus ir socialinį statusą, nei per paties žodžio prasmę. Žemo konteksto kultūrose (pvz., Šiaurės Amerikoje, Skandinavijoje) žodžio reikšmė yra svarbiausia, o papildomos informacijos perduodama nedaug. # Hierarchija kalboje: - **Atvirumas ir hierarchija**: Šalyse su griežta organizacine hierarchija (pvz., Japonijoje, Kinijoje) verbalinė komunikacija gali būti formaliau struktūrizuota. Kalbėdami žemesnieji pareigūnai su aukštesniais pareigūnais gali vartoti atitinkamus kreipinius ir pagarbos formas. Vakarų verslo kultūrose gali vyrauti demokratiškesnis ir atviresnis bendravimas. - **Vadovavimo stilius**: Vadovai iš kolektyvistinių kultūrų (pvz., Azijos šalys) tendencijos būti orientuoti į grupę ir bendruomeniškumą, o pavedimus gali perduoti netiesiogiai. Individualistinėse kultūrose (pvz., JAV, Australija) vadovai dažnai yra tiesmukiški ir individualizuoti savo požiūriu į valdymą. # Kalbinės normos ir mandagumas: - **Mandagumo formos**: Ką reiškia būti mandagiam skirtingose kultūrose? Angliškos „Please“ ir „Thank you“ formos gali būti vartojamos rečiau, kai kalbama ispaniškai arba japoniškai, kur mandagumas dažnai pareiškiamas per nuoskaudas, o ne tiesioginius prašymus ar padėkas. - **Taisyklinga kalba ir slangas**: Verslo aplinkoje naudojama kalba turi atspindėti profesionalumą, tačiau viename regione priimtinas ir suprantamas slengas ar žargonas gali būti visiškai netinkamas ir nesuprantamas kitame. # Laiko suvokimas kalboje: - **Monochroniniai ir polichroniniai laiko suvokimai**: Skirtingas laiko suvokimas verslo kultūrose įtakoja ir komunikaciją. Monochroninėse kultūrose (pvz., Šiaurės Amerikoje, Šveicarijoje) laikas yra griežtas ir struktūruotas, o susitikimai, terminai yra itin svarbūs. Polichroninėse kultūrose (pvz., Lotynų Amerikoje, Viduržemio jūros regione) dalykai gali būti lankstesni, o asmeniniai ryšiai dažnai yra svarbesni už laiko laikymąsi. # Patarimai efektyviai tarptautinei komunikacijai: - **Išmokti ir prisitaikyti**: Turint žinių apie skirtingas verslo kultūras, galima lengvai prisiderinti prie įvairių komunikacijos stilių ir priimti efektyvesnius sprendimus. - **Klausimai ir atsiliepimai**: Puikus būdas užtikrinti, kad jūsų žinutė buvo suprasta, yra prašyti paaiškinti tai, ką ką tik išgirdote ar perskaityte. Tai leidžia patikrinti, ar nėra jokių nesusipratimų ir ar informacija yra aiški. # Išvada: Verbaliniai komunikacijos skirtumai kultūrose gali būti sudėtingi, tačiau jie taip pat atspindi turtingą mūsų pasaulio įvairovę. Žinių apie šiuos skirtumus ir jų pripažinimas yra gyvybiškai svarbūs tarptautinio verslo santykių kūrimui ir palaikymui. Sėkmingai derinant žinojimą ir pritaikymo įgūdžius, galima efektyviai bendrauti ir dirbti skirtingose pasaulio verslo erdvėse."},{"prompt":"parasyk 4 įdomius faktus apie tai","completion":"1. **\\"Taip\\" ir \\"Ne\\" reikšmės**: Kalbant apie burnos reikšmes, labai įdomu yra tai, kaip \\"taip\\" ir \\"ne\\" gali būti suprantami skirtingai įvairiose kultūrose. Pavyzdžiui, Japonijoje \\"taip\\" (\\"hai\\") gali reikšti ne tik sutikimą, bet ir tai, kad asmuo suprato, ką sakote, o ne būtinai, kad jis su tuo sutinka. Tuo tarpu Graikijoje galvos linktelėjimas į priekį reiškia neigimą, o krūptelėjimas atgal – pritarimą. 2. **Silencija kaip kalba**: Kai kuriose kultūrose tyla komunikacijoje yra vertinama ir jos vengiama interpretuoti kaip nesutikimą ar neįdomumą. Suomiai, pavyzdžiui, yra gerai žinomi dėl savo polinkio į nekalbėjimą ir ilgus tylos momentus pokalbio metu. Jie vertina tylą kaip bendravimo būdą ir atspirties tašką gyvybingam mąstymui. 3. **Verslo terminai ir jų skirtingi atitikmenys**: Olandų kalbos žodis \\"beleefd\\" ir Anglų kalbos žodis \\"polite\\" abu išverčiami kaip \\"mandagus\\" lietuvių kalba. Tačiau olandiškasis \\"beleefd\\" turi silpną neigiamą atspalvį ir gali būti interpretuojamas kaip pernelyg oficialus ar atsiribojantis, tuo tarpu anglų kalbos \\"polite\\" dažniausiai yra visiškai teigiamas terminas. 4. **Konteksto įtaka**: arabų kalboje, puikus pavyzdys yra frazė \\"Insha'Allah\\", kuri reiškia \\"jei Dievas leis\\" ir naudojama nurodant, kad tam tikras įvykis įvyks priklausomai nuo Dievo valios. Ši frazė rodo tam tikrą nenuspėjamumo ir lemties jausmą, kuris yra įrašytas į komunikaciją arabų kultūroje ir gali sukelti iššūkių tiems, kurie yra įpratę prie Vakarų pasaulio tikslumo ir planavimo."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

En problemsiz yöntem nedir?","completion":"Delphi'de yapacağınız uygulamanın farklı ekran çözünürlükleri ve DPI değerlerinde uyumlu olarak çalışmasını istiyorsanız, çeşitli yaklaşımlar kullanabilirsiniz. İşte bazı öneriler: 1. **Otomatik Ölçeklendirme (Auto Scaling):** Delphi'nin daha yeni versiyonlarında (RAD Studio 10.2 ve üstü) High-DPI monitörlerde otomatik ölçeklendirme özellikleri mevcut olabilir. Formunuzun veya bileşenlerinizin 'Scaled' özelliğini \`True\` olarak ayarlayarak Delphi'nin sistemin DPI ayarlarına göre otomatik ölçeklendirme yapmasını sağlayabilirsiniz. \`\`\`delphi Form.Scaled := True; \`\`\` Ayrıca 'AutoScroll' özelliği de bazı durumlar için yararlı olabilir. 2. **Anchor ve Align Özellikleri:** Formunuzdaki kontrol elemanlarını anlamlandırarak (\`Anchor\`) ve hizalayarak (\`Align\`) nesnelerin pozisyonlarını ve boyutlarını ekrana göre otomatik olarak ayarlayabilirsiniz. Bu, formun öğelerinin boyutlarının ve konumlarının dinamik olarak yeniden boyutlandırılmasını sağlar. 3. **Manuel Ölçeklendirme:** Ekranın DPI değerine göre öğelerin boyutlarını ve konumlarını el ile hesaplayabilir ve ayarlayabilirsiniz. Kullanıcının ekran DPI’sini almak için \`GetDeviceCaps\` API fonksiyonunu kullanabilir ve form ile kontrol elemanlarınızı buna göre ölçeklendirebilirsiniz. \`\`\`delphi dpi := GetDeviceCaps(Form.Canvas.Handle, LOGPIXELSX); // dpi'ye göre öğeleri ölçeklendirin \`\`\` 4. **T-FormScaler Kullanımı:** Delphi'nin bazı sürümlerinde veya üçüncü parti kütüphanelerde, formunuzu veya bileşenlerinizi ölçekleyen bileşenler veya sınıflar bulunabilir. Bu bileşenler otomatik ölçeklendirme işlevleri sunarak işinizi kolaylaştırabilir. 5. **DPI Aware Ayarları:** Uygulamanızın manifest dosyasını düzenleyerek uygulamanızın High-DPI ayarlarını yapabilir ve 'DPI Aware' olarak işaretleyebilirsiniz. Böylece, işletim sistemi uygulamanızı yüksek DPI değerlerinde çalıştırırken ölçeklendirmeye çalışmaz ve uygulamanızın kendisi bu durumu yönetir. Bu yöntemlerin yanı sıra öğelerin font boyutlarını, resim çözünürlüklerini ve diğer görsel bileşenleri de dikkate almayı unutmamalısınız. Uygun ölçeklendirme yapmak önemlidir çünkü sadece boyutları değil, kullanıcı arayüzünün okunabilirliği ve kullanılabilirliği de önemlidir. Her durumda, farklı ekran çözünürlüklerinde test yapmak ve uyumluluğu doğrulamak önemlidir. Bu sorunu çözmek bazen zaman alabilir ve birden fazla çözümlenmesi gereken senaryo olabilir. Örneğin farklı işletim sistemleri, ekran ayarları veya kullanıcı tercihleri gibi. Bu nedenle, uygulamayı mümkün olan her kombinasyonda test etmek ve gerekli düzeltmeleri yapmak önem taşır."},{"prompt":"En başarılı ve ücretsiz, eski fotoğrafları restore eden yapay zeka hangisidir?","completion":"Eski fotoğrafları restore etmek için yapay zeka teknolojilerini kullanan birkaç ücretsiz araç mevcut olup, bunların başarısı projeden projeye ve kullanıcı tercihlerine göre değişiklik gösterebilir.

However, here are the forms: - cuando yo conocere (when I know) - cuando tú conoceres (when you know, familiar) - cuando él/ella/usted conocere (when he/she/you know) - cuando nosotros/nosotras conociéremos (when we know) - cuando vosotros/vosotras conocereis (when you know, plural familiar) - cuando ellos/ellas/ustedes conoceren (when they/you know, plural) Keep in mind that this form of the future subjunctive in Spanish is archaic and not used in common speech."},{"prompt":"The translation in future in Spanish doesn't sound good","completion":"I apologize for the confusion earlier. You're correct; the future subjunctive is very rarely used in modern Spanish and can sound strange or archaic. The future subjunctive in Spanish is indeed seldom used and typically only appears in legal or very formal documents, as well as literature. In everyday conversation and writing, the present subjunctive or other verbal constructions are used instead. For example, where Portuguese would use the future subjunctive, Spanish often uses the present subjunctive after \\"cuando\\" (when), assuming the action has not yet occurred or is hypothetical: - cuando yo conozca (when I know or meet) - cuando tú conozcas (when you know or meet) - cuando él/ella/usted conozca (when he/she/you know or meet) - cuando nosotros/nosotras conozcamos (when we know or meet) - cuando vosotros/vosotras conozcáis (when you all know or meet) - cuando ellos/ellas/ustedes conozcan (when they/you all know or meet) The present subjunctive is used widely in Spanish for future or hypothetical situations dependent on a condition, so you can expect to use \\"cuando + present subjunctive\\" for sentences that would use the future subjunctive in Portuguese. Again, I'm sorry for the confusion, and thank you for bringing that to my attention."},{"prompt":"\\"Abrangendo os estados do Acre, Amapá, Amazonas. Alèm disso, as comunidades....\\" Explain please and make it a detailed breakdown","completion":"The phrase you provided, \\"Abrangendo os estados do Acre, Amapá, Amazonas. Além disso, as comunidades...\\" is likely a part of a larger text in Portuguese. This sentence fragment can be broken down and explained as follows: - \\"Abrangendo\\" – This is the present participle (gerund) of the verb \\"abranger\\" in Portuguese, which means \\"to cover,\\" \\"to include,\\" or \\"to encompass.\\" - \\"os estados\\" – This phrase means \\"the states.\\" In Portuguese, \\"os\\" is the definite article for masculine plural nouns, and \\"estados\\" is the plural of \\"estado,\\" meaning \\"state\\" (as in the political territorial units). - \\"do Acre, Amapá, Amazonas\\" – \\"Do\\" is a contraction of the preposition \\"de\\" (of) with the masculine singular definite article \\"o\\" (the), so \\"do\\" means \\"of the\\" or \\"from the.\\" \\"Acre,\\" \\"Amapá,\\" and \\"Amazonas\\" are names of states in Brazil. This part of the sentence specifies which states are being included or encompassed. Each state is located in the northern region of Brazil, and Amazonas, in particular, is well known for containing much of the Brazilian part of the Amazon rainforest. - \\"Além disso\\" – This phrase means \\"Besides that,\\" \\"Furthermore,\\" or \\"In addition to that.\\" It is used to introduce an additional point or to expand upon what has already been mentioned. - \\"as comunidades...\\" – The word \\"as\\" is the definite article for feminine plural nouns, meaning \\"the\\" in English, and \\"comunidades\\" is the plural form of \\"comunidade,\\" meaning \\"communities.\\" This phrase is introducing another subject that is presumably related to the previously listed states. However, without the remainder of the sentence or context, it's not clear what the \\"comunidades\\" are or how they relate to the earlier part of the text. Putting this together so far, the text is discussing something that encompasses or includes the Brazilian states of Acre, Amapá, and Amazonas, and it's suggesting that there is an additional point about \\"communities\\" that will follow. The text could be discussing a geographic region, environmental program, research study, or some kind of initiative that involves the named states and local communities. Without more context, it is hard to be certain about the intent or scope of the subject matter."},{"prompt":"\\"Alèm disso\\" explain please","completion":"The phrase \\"Além disso\\" is a Portuguese expression that is translated as \\"Besides that,\\" \\"Furthermore,\\" \\"Moreover,\\" \\"In addition,\\" or \\"Additionally\\" in English. It is used as a conjunctive adverbial phrase to add information or introduce a new point that extends or elaborates on the previous statement. It often indicates that the speaker or writer is about to introduce another element or fact that complements or adds to what has already been mentioned. Here is an example of how \\"Além disso\\" might be used in a sentence: - Portuguese: \\"Eu falo inglês e espanhol. Além disso, estou aprendendo francês.\\" - English: \\"I speak English and Spanish. Furthermore, I am learning French.\\" In this example, \\"Além disso\\" is used to add the information that, in addition to speaking English and Spanish, the person is also learning French. The phrase is commonly used in both written and spoken Portuguese to smoothly transition between related thoughts or pieces of information within a conversation or text."},{"prompt":"\\"alèm disso\\" explain please and make it a detailed breakdown","completion":"The phrase \\"além disso\\" is a common expression in Portuguese, but it should be spelled \\"além disso,\\" without the accent on the \\"e.\\" Let's break down the phrase: - \\"além\\" – This word comes from the preposition \\"alem\\" in archaic Portuguese, which means \\"beyond\\" or \\"on the far side of\\" in English. As such, it is used to denote something that goes past a certain point or is in addition to what has already been mentioned or considered. - \\"disso\\" – This word is a demonstrative pronoun contraction that combines \\"de\\" (of) with \\"isso\\" (that). \\"Isso\\" refers back to something previously mentioned or understood within the context. The contraction \\"disso,\\" therefore, means \\"of that\\" or \\"about that.\\" So when put together, \\"além disso\\" literally means \\"beyond that\\" or \\"in addition to that.\\" It is used as a transitional phrase to introduce further information, reasons, or items in addition to what has been previously stated. It can indicate that the speaker is providing supplementary information or an extra point to support or elaborate upon an argument or subject. In English, this phrase is commonly translated as \\"besides that,\\" \\"furthermore,\\" \\"moreover,\\" \\"in addition,\\" or \\"additionally.\\" It functions similarly to how we might use these terms to introduce additional points in English. Here's an example to illustrate its use: Portuguese: \\"O hotel oferece um excelente café da manhã. Além disso, está localizado perto da praia.\\" English: \\"The hotel offers an excellent breakfast. Moreover, it is located near the beach.\\" In the example, \\"além disso\\" is used to add more positive information about the hotel, which enhances the attractiveness or value of the hotel in the conversation."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Bu görüş, XX. yüzyılın başından bu yana gelişmekte olan bir felsefi akım olup çeşitli şekillerde ifade edilmiş ve savunulmuştur. Şimdi sorularınızın cevaplarına sırasıyla bakalım: 1. Fizikalizmin Ortaya Çıkışı ve Kronolojisi - 1920'ler ve 1930'lar: Mantıksal pozitivizm hareketi ile fizikalizmin ilk biçimleri ortaya çıkmıştır. Viyana Çevresi filozofları, bilimin dilini ve metodolojisini temel alarak metafiziksel ifadeleri dışlamışlardır. - 1940'lar ve 1950'ler: Davranışçılığın yükselişi ile birlikte, Gilbert Ryle gibi bazı filozoflar zihinsel durumları fiziksel davranışları öngörebilir durumlar olarak tanımlamışlardır. - 1960'lar: \\"Kimlik teorisi\\" veya \\"tip-tip kimlik teorisi\\" ile zihinsel durumların beyindeki fiziksel durumlarla özdeş olduğu savunulmuştur (Ullin Place, Herbert Feigl ve J.J.C. Smart tarafından). - 1970'ler ve 1980'ler: Fonksiyonalizm, zihinsel durumları beyindeki belirli fiziksel durumlarla değil, işlevleriyle tanımlama yolunu seçmiştir. Hilary Putnam ve Jerry Fodor bu görüşün önde gelen savunucularındandır. - 1990'lar ve sonrası: Fizikalizm, daha kapsamlı ve ayrıntılı olarak \\"redüktif olmayan fizikalizm\\", \\"düzenleyici rol fizikalizmi\\", \\"varoluşçu fizikalizm\\" gibi türlerle geliştirilmiştir. 2. Fizikalizmin Amacı ve Çözülmeye Çalışılan Problemler Fizikalizmin ortaya atılma nedenleri genellikle aşağıdaki problemlere çözüm bulmaya yöneliktir: - Zihin-Beden Problemi: Fizikalizm, zihin ve beden arasındaki etkileşimi nasıl açıklayabileceğimizle ilgili temel bir sorundur. - Bilinç Problemi: Bilincin öznel deneyiminin nasıl fiziksel süreçlerle açıklanabileceği sorunuyla ilgilenir. - Bağımsızlık Sorunu: Zihinsel durumların fiziksel dünyadaki nesnelerden nasıl farklı ve bağımsız olduğunu anlamaya çalışır. - Redüksiyonizm: Zihinsel fenomenlerin beyin süreçleri veya diğer bilimsel açıklamalarla tamamen indirgenebilir olup olmadığı konusudur. 3. Fizikalizmin Tezleri ve Farklı Türleri Fizikalizmin çeşitli tezleri ve türleri zihin-beden ilişkisini açıklamaya yönelik farklı yaklaşımlarla birbirinden ayrılır: - Kimlik Teorisi: Zihinsel durumlarla beyindeki fiziksel süreçlerin aynı olduğunu savunur. - Davranışçılık: Zihinsel durumları gözlemlenebilir davranışlar ve davranışsal eğilimler cinsinden açıklar. - Fonksiyonalizm: Zihinsel durumları karmaşık sistemlerin işleyiş biçimleri ve fonksiyonları cinsinden tanımlar. - Redüktif Fizikalizm: Zihinsel olayların nihayetinde fiziksel olaylara indirgenebileceğini ileri sürer. - Non-reduktif Fizikalizm (Yapısalcı Fizikalizm): Zihinsel olayların fiziksel olaylarca türediklerini, fakat bunlara tam olarak indirgenemeyeceklerini savunur. - Eliminativizm: Günlük yaşamda kullandığımız 'zihin' terimlerinin, yanlış ve aldatıcı olduğunu, dolayısıyla bilimsel açıklamalarda kullanılmaması gerektiğini öne sürer. Farklı fizikalizm türleri, zihnin doğası ve bilincin nasıl açıklanabileceği üzerine devam eden tartışmalarda çeşitli argüman ve savlarla kendilerini ortaya koyarlar. Bu nedenle, birden fazla fizikalizm türü aynı zamanda farklı filozoflar ve düşüncelerle temsil edilebilir ve her bir tür kendi içinde daha da detaylanabilir."},{"prompt":"CREER UN sympy PHYTON POUR LA SIMULATION D’UN MOUVEMENT VIBRATOIRE A 1 DDL Considerez un systeme vibrant avec amrtissement et excite par une force periodique(cas general, pas forcement sinusoidal) .

Каждый модуль реализуется отдельно, что упрощает разработку, тестирование и поддержку. 2. **Абстракция:** Подсистемы ядра предоставляют абстракции для аппаратного обеспечения, таким образом, создавая унифицированный интерфейс для работы прикладного программного обеспечения с различным оборудованием. 3. **Инкапсуляция:** Детали реализации каждой подсистемы скрыты от других. Это позволяет менять реализацию внутри подсистемы без воздействия на другие части системы. 4. **Сотрудничество:** Подсистемы взаимодействуют друг с другом через чётко определённые интерфейсы и протоколы обмена, обеспечивая необходимый уровень координации и совместной работы. 5. **Иерархичность:** Взаимодействие между подсистемами может быть организовано иерархически – нижележащие подсистемы предоставляют службы вышележащим. 6. **Событийная обработка:** Подсистемы могут обмениваться информацией через механизмы асинхронных событий или прерываний. 7. **Синхронизация и блокировки:** Для обеспечения целостности данных и правильного совместного доступа подсистемы используют механизмы синхронизации, такие как мьютексы, семафоры и примитивы блокировки. 8. **Политика и механизм:** Часто ядра разделяют политику (правила и стратегии, определяющие поведение системы) от механизмов (инструменты для реализации этих правил).

In magic dueling, the teams don't cast offensive spells on each other but the point of the duel is to cast and conjure beautiful and artistic spells to earn points. We're dueling against a trio of 9 year old girls called Lily, Lavender, and Lilac. Give each girl complex stats. My team starts with higher stats because we're older. Give us all a list of spells that we have access to. Spells can't be cast more than once. Use dice rolls to determine success of spells and how many points the team earns. Spells can be cast either individually, or merged with two persons or with three persons. Merged spells are more difficult to conjure because all participants must succeed in their part and must be harmonious with each other, but merged spells earn more points. The three younger mages each have access to an additional spell that they plan on using—an age regression spell that mentally regresses its target mentally and physically by 3 years. There's no limit to how many time they can cast this spell in the duel, but they receive no points for it. If two merge the spell, they can regress the entire opposing team by 2 years. If all three of them merge the spell, they can regress the entire opposing team by 4 years. Age regression effects include decrease in stats. Each turn all 6 mages cast a spell and teams decide whether to cast individually or merge spells together. The duel will go on for 10 rounds. If I, Ruby, or Emerald are reduced to the age of 5 years old, said mage is out of the duel because they can no longer cast spells. Run a complete simulation of this scenario.","completion":"Given the complexity of this request, I will establish the groundwork for this roleplay game scenario, which involves creating the characters, defining their stats and skills, and outlining the mechanics for spell casting and age regression. This will provide you with a robust framework to play out the scenario, complete with the information you will need to run the simulation. However, I am not able to simulate the entirety of the gameplay step-by-step. **Characters and Stats:** ***Team Sapphire:*** - Sapphire (16 years old): Intellect 8, Creativity 7, Dexterity 6, Charisma 7, Stamina 5 - Ruby (16 years old): Intellect 7, Creativity 6, Dexterity 8, Charisma 6, Stamina 5 - Emerald (16 years old): Intellect 6, Creativity 8, Dexterity 7, Charisma 5, Stamina 6 ***Team Lily:*** - Lily (9 years old): Intellect 5, Creativity 5, Dexterity 3, Charisma 6, Stamina 3 - Lavender (9 years old): Intellect 4, Creativity 6, Dexterity 4, Charisma 5, Stamina 4 - Lilac (9 years old): Intellect 6, Creativity 4, Dexterity 5, Charisma 4, Stamina 3 **Spells Available:** ***Team Sapphire:*** - Individual: Arcane Blossoms, Mystic Veil, Prism Cascade, Echoes of the Elders, Twilight Mirage - Paired: Celestial Harmony, Whispering Winds, Aurora Dance - Triad: Symphony of Stars, Woven Dreams of Fate ***Team Lily:*** - Individual: Petal Whirlwind, Rainbow Bubbles, Gleaming Flickers, Dazzling Sparkles, Merry Melodies - Paired: Spirited Waltz, Flashing Fireflies, Blooming Brilliance - Triad: Delightful Chorus, Miniature Cosmos - Special (Unlimited use, no point gain): Age Regression **Game Mechanics:** Roll a 20-sided die for each spell cast attempt. - Individual spells require a roll of 8 or higher to succeed. - Paired spells require each mage involved to roll 12 or higher. - Triad spells require each mage to roll 15 or higher. If a spell is successfully cast, roll a 10-sided die to determine points scored: - Individual: 1d10 points - Paired: 2d10 points - Triad: 3d10 points Age Regression Spell Mechanics: - Single caster targeting one member of the opposite team: 10 or higher regresses the target by 3 years. - Paired casting targeting the entire team: 14 or higher regresses the entire targeted team by 2 years. - Triad casting targeting the entire team: 17 or higher regresses the entire targeted team by 4 years. Each time a mage is regressed, their stats are decreased by 1 in every category. If a 16-year-old is regressed to 13 years old, for example, they would lose 1 point across all stats. Let's play out the first round to help you get started. **Round 1:** *Sapphire's Team Decide on Spells:* - Sapphire: Individual - Arcane Blossoms - Ruby: Individual - Mystic Veil - Emerald: Individual - Prism Cascade *Lily's Team Decide on Spells:* - Lily: Individual - Petal Whirlwind - Lavender: Individual - Rainbow Bubbles - Lilac: Special - Age Regression (Targeting Sapphire) *Dice Rolls for Spell Success:* Sapphire's Team: - Sapphire rolls an 11 for Arcane Blossoms; success, rolls 1d10 for points and gets 6 points. - Ruby rolls a 14 for Mystic Veil; success, rolls 1d10 for points and gets 4 points. - Emerald rolls a 9 for Prism Cascade; success, rolls 1d10 for points and gets 8 points. *Lily's Team:* - Lily rolls a 7 for Petal Whirlwind; failure, no points are scored. - Lavender rolls a 13 for Rainbow Bubbles; success, rolls 1d10 for points and gets 5 points. - Lilac rolls an 18 for Age Regression on Sapphire; success, Sapphire is now momentarily 13 years old with decreased stats (Intellect 7, Creativity 6, Dexterity 5, Charisma 6, Stamina 4). Points after Round 1: - Team Sapphire: 6 + 4 + 8 = 18 points - Team Lily: 5 points From this point, you would continue with the next nine rounds, deciding which spells to cast, determining their success with dice rolls, calculating points, and managing any further age regression tactics from Team Lily. Remember that strategizing spell combinations can lead to higher points but comes with increased risk.

Fizikalizmin tarihsel gelişimini, ortaya çıkış amacını ve birbirinden ayırt edilen tezleri incelerken belirli tarihler verememekle birlikte, genel hatlarıyla aşağıdaki gibi özetlenebilir: 1. Fizikalizm Türlerinin Ortaya Çıkışı ve Kronolojisi: Fizikalizmin kökenleri modern bilimsel devrime kadar geri uzansa da, zihin felsefesi bağlamında daha sistematik bir şekilde 19. yüzyılın sonlarına ve 20. yüzyılın başlarına kadar izlenebilir. Zihin felsefesinde fizikalizmin ana akım haline gelmesi ve çeşitlenmesi özellikle 20. yüzyılın ikinci yarısında olmuştur. - **Çeşitleme Fizikalizmi (Reductive Physicalism)**: 20. yüzyılın ortalarında, lojik pozitivistler ve diğer filozoflar, zihinsel durumların fiziksel durumlarla özdeş olduğunu veya fiziksel durumlarca tamamen açıklanabileceğini savunmaya başladılar. Buna bazen tip-tip fizikalizmi de denir. - **Yapısal Fizikalizm (Structural Physicalism)**: 1960'lar ve 1970'lerde bazı fizikalistler, zihinsel durumların ve özelliklerinin fiziksel dünyanın yapısal özellikleriyle ilişkilendirilebileceği görüşünü savundular. - **İşlemsel Fizikalizm (Functionalism)**: 1960'lar ve 1970'lerde, zihinsel durumların fiziksel durumların işlevsel rolleri olarak anlaşılabileceği önerisi ortaya atıldı. - **Yapısalcı Fizikalizm (Nonreductive Physicalism)**: 20. yüzyılın son çeyreğinde, bazı filozoflar zihinsel özelliklerin fiziksel özelliklere indirgenemeyen fakat yine de fiziksel dünya ile uyumlu olduğunu savunan bir yaklaşım geliştirdiler. 2. Fizikalizmin Ortaya Çıkış Amacı: Fizikalizm, özellikle şu tür problemlere çözüm getirme amacıyla ortaya atılmıştır: - **Zihin-Beden İlişkisi:** Fiziksel dünya ve zihinsel fenomenler arasındaki ilişkiyi açıklamak. - **Nedensellik:** Zihinsel durumların olaylarda nedensel etkileri olup olmadığını ve nasıl etkilediğini anlamak. - **Bilimsel Uyumluluk:** Zihin teorilerini bilimsel görüşlerle, özellikle nörobilim ve fizik kuramlarıyla uyumlu hale getirmek. - **Indirgenicilik:** Zihinsel fenomenlerin fiziksel fenomenlere indirgenebileceğini öne süren görüşler. - **Doğalizm:** Felsefenin ve bilimin doğa yasalarına uygun olarak zihinsel olayları açıklama çabası. 3. Birbirinden Ayırt Edilen Tezler: Fizikalizmin temel tezleri zihinsel durumların doğası ve onların fiziksel durumlarla olan ilişkisi üzerine odaklanır. Bu tezler şunları içerebilir: - **Kimlik Tezi:** Zihinsel durumlar fiziksel durumlarla özdeştir (örneğin, acı hissetmek belirli bir beyin durumunun ta kendisidir). - **Nedensellik Tezi:** Zihinsel durumlar fiziksel olaylar nedeniyle meydana gelir ve fiziksel olaylara neden olabilir. - **Supervenience Tezi:** Zihinsel özellikler fiziksel özellikler üzerinde supervenir; yani, herhangi bir zihinsel değişiklik, altta yatan fiziksel değişikliklerle ilişkilidir. - **İşlevselcilik:** Zihinsel durumlar, onların işlevsel rolleri üzerinden anlaşılır; yani, bir durumunuzun bir zihinsel durum olması, başka durumlar ve davranışlarla olan işlevsel ilişkisine dayanır. Bu türler ve tezler, zihin felsefesindeki fizikalizmin ana hatlarını çizer ve felsefeciler arasında bu konseptler etrafında sürekli bir tartışma ve gelişme söz konusudur."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for stock photo for social media within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical book and coffee and flower","completion":"\\"Modern Flat Lay | Social Media Ready Stock Photo | Books, Coffee & Blooms Image | Bloggers & Business Visual Content | Digital Download\\""},{"prompt":"In the context of a hypothetical novel, write a scene in which a female protagonist, explains to her male partner the new rules of the house, including his new female attire..

David waited patiently, a sense of anxiety knotting in his stomach, as he knew that their life was on the precipice of change. An open laptop lay between them, its screen showing the image of a well-designed document titled \\"New House Rules\\", a new chapter of their shared story waiting to be written. Marissa took a deep breath, her eyes meeting David's, searching for an understanding that she prayed would come. \\"David, you know how much our relationship means to me, and how much I value openness and the freedom to be our true selves,\\" she began, her voice carrying the weight of many unspoken thoughts. David nodded, the gesture a silent urging for her to continue. She flicked her gaze to the screen, a finger tapping methodically on the table. \\"There's something liberating about shedding the layers we've been bound by. The expectations, the pre-written scripts of who we're supposed to be,\\" Marissa continued, her words careful but sure. David felt his heart skip, an inkling of where this was leading, yet he stayed quiet, allowing her the space she needed to reveal the depths of her heart. Marissa inhaled sharply and let the words spill forth, \\"I want us, in this home, to explore without judgment. To express ourselves in ways that might seem... unconventional. I'd like for both of us to feel free to explore all aspects of our identities here, where we're safe from the outside world.\\" David's brow furrowed, a gentle confusion casting shadows across his face, and Marissa reached out, placing her hand over his. \\"What I'm saying is, I would like to introduce more...fluidity into our lives. For starters, I think it would be beneficial, liberating even, for us to occasionally switch our traditional roles and...attire.\\" David's breath hitched as he processed her words, a tumult of emotions roiling within him. Was this the freedom they'd casually joked about during late-night conversations, now becoming a reality? Marissa's words grew bolder, each one landing like a carefully placed step across a minefield. “I want you to experience what I do, the nuances of my world, and I want to step into yours. In practice, it means sometimes you might wear what I wear, dresses, skirts... perhaps even makeup, if you’re open to it. Not as a joke or a game, but as a way to understand, to empathize, to grow.\\" David sat motionless, the gravity of her proposal anchoring him to his seat. Marissa searched his eyes desperately, seeking a sign of acceptance, or at least a willingness to understand. \\"I've thought about this,\\" she continued, gently squeezing his hand. \\"I believe this could bring us closer, help us understand each other on levels we've never imagined.\\" The silence was consuming as David processed her plea. Slowly, the shock gave way to curiosity. He considered the love and fearlessness in Marissa’s eyes, the courage it must have taken for her to articulate such a bold suggestion, a suggestion that was tearing down walls he hadn't even realized were there. Finally, David spoke, his voice a little unsteady but open, \\"Marissa, there's no one I trust more than you. If this is what it takes to not only deepen our bond but to shatter these invisible constraints we've lived in, then I'm willing to try.\\" A small, tentative smile curved his lips as he added, \\"Though, you'll have to help me with the... fashion choices. I'm at a bit of a loss there.\\" Marissa's eyes sparked with a mixture of relief and excitement. \\"Of course, we'll start slow. And this goes both ways, David. There's strength and vulnerability in stepping into each other's shoes,\\" she promised. \\"And if at any point it's not working, we adjust. The point is to nurture our relationship, not to compromise it.\\" They both let out a soft, unified chuckle, the tension in the room dissipating like mist in the warmth of the sun.

Marissa swept through the door with an air of determination that made David smile despite his nerves. The interior smelled of fabric and leather, and it was filled with rows upon rows of clothing from bygone eras; suits of armor stood like silent sentinels amidst flapper dresses and Victorian gowns. Marissa led David past these relics to a section marked \\"Servants & Staff\\". As they browsed through the racks, Marissa pulled out a pristine 40's style parlour maid uniform. The dress was a classic black and white, with crisp pleats and a modest apron to match. David held the garment up against himself, twisting his lips thoughtfully. \\"Well,\\" he quipped, trying to cut through his own tension with humor, \\"it's either this or florals and polka dots, and quite frankly, I can't stand polka dots!\\" Marissa laughed, her eyes dancing with amusement. \\"Madame Sterne wouldn't be caught dead hiring a maid with poor fashion sense,\\" she teased. \\"Then it's settled,\\" David replied, a smirk growing on his face as he turned to look at himself in the mirror, adjusting the uniform to get a rough idea of the fit. \\"Madame Sterne will just have to whip her new hire into shape.\\" Madame Sterne—the persona Marissa had playfully adopted for their new adventure—was a woman of another era: strict but fair, with a keen eye for perfection. David could almost picture her, clad in finery, scrutinizing his every move. \\"Remember,\\" Marissa said, her voice taking on a playful but authoritative tone, \\"Madame Sterne expects her staff to maintain a certain...attitude that matches their attire.\\" David straightened his back, assuming a more subservient posture. \\"Yes, Madame,\\" he responded with a mock serious nod. \\"I shall strive to uphold the highest standards of domestic excellence.\\" They looked at each other and burst into laughter, the sound echoing off the vintage walls. The owner of the shop, an elderly lady with a sharp eye and an even sharper wit, approached them. \\"That uniform will look splendid with the proper adjustments. And don't you worry, sir,\\" she said, winking at David, \\"we've got just the right undergarments to give you that authentic 1940's silhouette.\\" David's face reddened slightly, but he embraced the moment. They were not just purchasing a uniform; they were buying an experience, an exploration of trust, an adventure in their relationship. With each layer of the outfit, he felt strangely liberated, stepping into a role that society would never have freely offered him.

The uniform waited patiently, laid out across the bed like a silent invitation to another world. Swiftly, David was out of his day clothes, slipping into the layers of the parlour maid's attire with Marissa's guiding hand. She ensured every detail was perfect, from the stockings neatly pulled up to the knee to the crisp apron tied with a bow at the back. The final touch came when Marissa gently placed a wig atop David's head. The chestnut curls framed his face, softening his features, and in the mirror before them stood someone entirely new. \\"Present yourself to Madame Sterne,\\" Marissa instructed with a playful strictness. David took a deep breath and nodded. He stepped out of the bedroom, his shoes making soft clicks on the hardwood floor. He found Marissa seated gracefully on the living room sofa, her posture upright with an air of expectancy. With his head kept low in a display of subservience, David approached but, in his focus on capturing the proper demeanor, he forgot one crucial element of his role - the curtsey. \\"Ah ah ah,\\" Marissa, the ever-watchful Madame Sterne, clicked her tongue in gentle disapproval. \\"It seems my new maid has forgotten her manners. Where is my curtsey?\\" David's cheeks turned a crimson hue, realizing his oversight amidst the eagerness to perform his role well. He quickly attempted to remedy the faux pas, maneuvering the unfamiliar territory of his new garb with a clumsy grace. He dipped into a curtsey, the skirt flaring slightly, hoping it would meet Madame Sterne's standards. \\"That's better,\\" Marissa approved with a nod, a twinkle of mirth in her eyes. \\"Remember, it's all in the details. A parlour maid must be poised and graceful at all times.\\" David straightened up and offered a shy smile, one that belonged to his new persona. \\"Thank you for your guidance, Madame. I'll be sure to remember next time.\\" The atmosphere was intoxicating with play and the freedom of exploration, their everyday world extended into a haven of vivid roleplay. As they continued the afternoon, Marissa's Madame Sterne was both firm and kind, teaching her new maid the proper way to manage the household. With each task performed under Marissa's scrutinizing gaze, the seriousness of their roleplay was beautifully undercut by laughter and shared glances that said more than words ever could. David found a vulnerability he had never known, and Marissa found a respect and love for David that transcended the costumes and the pretenses. They were not just partners playing dress-up; they were two souls dancing on the edges of their comfort zones, creating a space where trust was the true uniform of the day."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

L'idée de l'encapsulation renvoie également à la programmation orientée objet, où l'on cache les détails de l'implémentation et expose uniquement les interfaces pour interagir avec l'objet. Dans le contexte des modèles de langage à grande échelle (LLM pour Large Language Models), tels que GPT-3 ou les variantes de BERT, la température, le top-k sampling et le top-p (nucleus) sampling sont plutôt considérés comme des stratégies ou des hyperparamètres pour le processus de génération de texte, plutôt que des \\"modules encapsulés\\" au sens classique de l’architecture logicielle. Voici une explication de ces termes : - **Température** : C'est un hyperparamètre utilisé dans les fonctions de softmax lors de la génération de texte. Il contrôle la \\"randomness\\" des prédictions. Une température proche de zéro force le modèle à choisir les prédictions les plus probables, tandis qu'une température plus élevée rend les prédictions plus aléatoires. - **Top-k sampling** : Cette stratégie consiste à restreindre le choix du modèle aux k tokens les plus probables à chaque étape de prédiction et à échantillonner uniquement parmi ces k choix. - **Top-p (nucleus) sampling** : Cette méthode fait un échantillonnage parmi un ensemble de tokens dont la somme des probabilités est au moins p, où p est un hyperparamètre (par exemple, 0.9). Cela crée un \\"nucleus\\" de tokens plausibles et évite le problème du top-k sampling où k est fixe et peut inclure des tokens très improbables si k est trop grand. Ces stratégies ne sont pas des modules au sens strict, car elles ne sont généralement pas des composants distincts de l'architecture du modèle de langage, mais plutôt des parties intégrantes du processus de génération de texte. Elles n'ont pas non plus leur propre interface de programmation externe ou des fonctionnalités séparées de celles du modèle de langage lui-même. Néanmoins, vous pourriez considérer ces éléments comme encapsulés dans le sens où ils représentent des parties abstraits du système de génération de texte qui ont des rôles fonctionnels clairs, et leur implémentation interne n'a pas besoin d'être connue par l'utilisateur du modèle, qui peut les ajuster en tant qu'hyperparamètres sans avoir à modifier le code source du modèle lui-même."},{"prompt":"Quelle différence fais tu entre paramètre et hyperparamètre ?","completion":"Dans le contexte de l'apprentissage automatique et des modèles statistiques, les termes \\"paramètre\\" et \\"hyperparamètre\\" désignent deux concepts différents mais liés. Voici la différence entre les deux : **Paramètres :** Ce sont les composants du modèle qui sont appris à partir des données pendant le processus d'entraînement. Dans un modèle de régression linéaire, par exemple, les coefficients associés à chaque variable explicative sont des paramètres du modèle. Pour un réseau de neurones, les poids et les biais sont des paramètres qui sont ajustés dans le processus d'apprentissage pour minimiser une fonction de coût (par exemple, l'erreur quadratique moyenne). Ces paramètres sont ajustés en utilisant des données et un algorithme d'optimisation, tel que la descente de gradient. **Hyperparamètres :** Contrairement aux paramètres, les hyperparamètres ne sont pas appris directement à partir des données pendant l'entraînement du modèle. Au lieu de cela, ils doivent être définis avant l'entraînement et contrôlent le processus d'entraînement lui-même ou la structure du modèle. Les hyperparamètres incluent la taille du lot (batch size), le taux d'apprentissage, la complexité du modèle (comme le nombre de couches dans un réseau de neurones), et les stratégies mentionnées précédemment, telles que la température et les paramètres du top-k ou top-p sampling pour la génération de texte. Le choix des hyperparamètres peut avoir un grand impact sur les performances du modèle, et ils sont souvent choisis en utilisant une combinaison de connaissances d'experts et de techniques de recherche telles que la validation croisée. En résumé, les paramètres sont ce que le modèle apprend directement à partir des données, tandis que les hyperparamètres sont les réglages que le praticien doit fixer pour guider le processus d'apprentissage. Les paramètres peuvent changer à chaque étape de l'entraînement, alors que les hyperparamètres sont généralement constants pendant l'entraînement, sauf si une méthode d'ajustement d'hyperparamètres en ligne est utilisée."},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Modern Flat Lay | Social Media Ready Stock Photo | Books, Coffee &amp; Blooms Image | Bloggers &amp; Business Visual Content | Digital Download.

Fizikalizmin en temel önermesi, zihinsel olayların ve özelliklerin fiziksel olaylarla ve özelliklerle ilişkili olduğu veya onlardan türetilebileceği fikridir. Fizikalizmin farklı türleri arasındaki en önemli ayrımlar, zihinsel ve fiziksel olaylar arasındaki ilişkinin mahiyeti ile ilgilidir. Şimdi bu sorulara tek tek yanıt vermeye çalışacağım: 1. Fizikalizmin evrimi ve tarihleri: - Mantıksal Davranışçılık: 1930'larda ortaya atıldı ve zihni, gözlemlenebilen davranışlar ve davranışsal eğilimlerle tanımlamaya çalıştı. - Tür-Fizikalizm (Tür- Kimlik Teorisi): 1950'ler ve 1960'lar boyunca gelişti. Zihinsel durumların fiziksel beyin durumlarıyla özdeş olduğunu savundu. - Belirli Durum Fizikalizmi: 1960'lar ve 1970'lerde popülerdi ve bireysel zihinsel olayların belirli fiziksel olaylarla eşlenik olduğunu öne sürdü. - Fonksiyonalizm: 1960'lar ve 1970'lerde gelişti. Zihinsel durumları onların işlevleri, daha çok bilgi işlemsel rolleri açısından tanımlamaya çalıştı. - İndirgemeci Olmayan Fizikalizm: 1970'ler ve 1980'lerde ortaya çıktı ve zihinsel olayların fiziksel dünyaya bağlı olmasına rağmen, tamamen indirgenemeyeceğini savundu. 2. Problemlere getirilen çözümler: - Mantıksal Davranışçılık, zihinle ilgili özel bir şeyin olmadığını, tamamen davranışlarla açıklanabileceğini ileri sürerek zihnin ontolojik statüsü problemine çözüm getirmeye çalıştı. - Tür-Fizikalizm (Tür- Kimlik Teorisi), zihinsel durumları beyin durumlarıyla eşitleyerek zihin-beden problemine fizikalist bir çözüm sundu ve zihinsel olayların fiziksel dünya içinde bir yere oturtulmasına çalıştı. - Belirli Durum Fizikalizmi, zihinsel olayların beyin durumlarıyla özdeşliğini daha spesifik olarak dile getirerek zihinsel durumların nörobiyolojik temeli üzerine odaklandı. - Fonksiyonalizm, çoklu realizabilite problemini ele alarak zihinsel durumların farklı fiziksel sistemlerde nasıl gerçekleşebileceği sorunsalına çözüm getirdi. - İndirgemeci Olmayan Fizikalizm (eş anlamlı olarak kullanılan Supervenience Fizikalizmi gibi), zorlu anlamın ve fenomenal bilincin problemlerini ele alarak indirgemeciliğin zorluklarını kabul edip fizikalist çerçeveyi korumaya çalıştı. 3. Teklik Tezleri: - Mantıksal Davranışçılık, zihin durumlarının davranış kalıpları ile tanımlanabileceği düşüncesine dayanır. - Tür-Fizikalizmi, aynı zihinsel olayların her zaman aynı tür fiziksel durumlarla eşdeğer olacağını önerir. - Belirli Durum Fizikalizmi, her özgün zihinsel durumun özgün bir fiziksel durumla eşleştiğini ileri sürer. - Fonksiyonalizm, zihinsel durumları beyin durumlarından farklı olarak kabul eder ve onları kendi iç işlevleri bağlamında tanımlar. - İndirgemeci Olmayan Fizikalizm, zihinsel durumların fiziksel durumlara supervenient (bağlı ve türemiş) olduğunu, ancak indirgenemeyeceğini savunur.

Here is how each method is applicable: 1. An Internal Rate of Return (IRR) function: IRR is a financial function used to calculate an investment's rate of return. When applied to bonds, the IRR function can be used to find the yield to maturity (YTM) by setting the present value of all future cash flows equal to the bond's current market price. 2. Algebraic manipulation: By using the formula for bond pricing, which equates the present value of future cash flows (coupon payments and principal repayment) to the bond's price, one can algebraically solve for the yield to maturity, although it usually requires approximation because bond pricing equations typically do not have closed-form solutions. 3. Numerical methods: Numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method can be used to solve for the yield when direct algebraic manipulation is not possible due to the non-linear nature of the bond pricing equation. 4. Manual trial and error iteration: One could also manually guess different yields and compute the bond price until the guessed yield results in a price that is close enough to the actual market price. This is a rudimentary form of manual iteration. 5. Automated trial and error iteration (e.g., \\"Goal Seek\\"): Spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel have features like \\"Goal Seek\\" that automate the trial and error process to find the yield to maturity. You set the desired bond price (usually the market price), and Goal Seek changes the yield until the calculated bond price matches the target price. Given that all choices provided can be used to find the yield of a bond, the statement is a trick question. If the question intends to ask which one cannot be used, then there's an issue as all options listed are viable methods for determining a bond's yield."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The yield can be estimated or calculated using various methods, including those listed in your answer choices. However, you're asking for a method that cannot be used to find the yield of a bond. Let's evaluate your options: - An Internal Rate of Return (IRR) function: This is a standard method for calculating a bond's yield. It's often used in financial calculators and spreadsheet software like Excel. - Algebraic manipulation: While straightforward algebra might not be able to solve for a bond's yield directly due to the nature of the equation (which is transcendental and cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions), you can rearrange the formula and make an educated guess followed by iteration. So technically, algebraic manipulation can be involved in finding the yield, though it often requires numerical approximation. - Numerical methods: These methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method or bisection method, are actually designed to find a bond's yield. Numeric methods can provide high precision in yield calculations. - Manual trial and error iteration: Although not efficient, this method theoretically could be used. You would manually adjust the yield until the present value of the bond's cash flows equals the bond's price. However, this is tedious and likely to be imprecise. - Automated trial and error iteration (e.g., \\"Goal Seek\\"): Tools like Excel's \\"Goal Seek\\" can automate the iteration process and can certainly be used to calculate a bond's yield.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the flowchart: Product Testing: There are three products labeled \\"Product 1,\\" \\"Product 2,\\" and \\"Product 3.\\" These seem to represent items or services that are to be tested for accessibility. Test Completion Report: Once the products are tested, a \\"Test completion report Accessibility Register\\" is created. This suggests that the results of the accessibility tests for all three products are compiled into one report. Decision Funnel: The flowchart then features a funnel shape with two pathways: The left pathway signifies \\"Released\\" with a label underneath stating \\"Accessibility achieved Happy Days,\\" implying that if the product passes the accessibility test, it is released to the market. The right pathway indicates \\"Accessibility NOT ACHIEVED,\\" which directs the process to a different procedure. Registration: If the accessibility is not achieved, the process involves a \\"Register\\" step, which is likely to record the unsuccessful attempt at achieving accessibility. Risk Management System: Following the register step, the process involves input into a \\"Risk Mgmt System (Archer),\\" indicating that the information is entered into a risk management system named Archer for further action or tracking. Further Actions: If accessibility is not achieved, a \\"Raise Finding within our Customer Risk\\" action is taken. This seems to suggest that a report or alert is raised within the organization's customer risk management framework. Following this, a \\"Create Action In name of PO\\" step is indicated. \\"PO\\" could stand for \\"Product Owner\\" or \\"Purchase Order,\\" depending on the context. This implies that an action is created, possibly a task or a corrective measure, attributed to the PO.

It appears to outline a process for testing the accessibility of products and what steps to take depending on whether or not the products meet accessibility standards. The flowchart includes a pathway for products that achieve the necessary level of accessibility and are released to the market (\\"Happy Days\\"), as well as a pathway for products that do not achieve accessibility, which leads to registration of the issue, risk management through the \\"Archer\\" system, raising findings within customer risk, and creating actions for the Product Owner to address. This process seems to incorporate both quality control and risk management to ensure that products not only comply with accessibility requirements but also that there is a system in place to handle products that fail to meet those standards. The process is systematic and indicates clear follow-up actions in cases where accessibility is not achieved, showing an organized approach to product accessibility and accountability."},{"prompt":"That image represents the process Accessibility Centre of Excellence is trying to implement to ensure that products within an organisation creates accessible products. Earlier we had a process implemented called \\"Accessibility Deferment\\" and its definition is as follows: If a project team approaches to ACoE stating that they want to release their product but there are some accessibility defects (both Critical and High severity) that cannot be fixed either because of less time or because those accessibility defects are difficult to resolve in the given amount of time, then can seek what we call as \\"Accessibility deferment\\". Also, there may be some extraordinary circumstances where there could be critical business justification that prevents achieving accessibility conformance. In this scenario project teams can seek deferment that allows for a temporary delay of achieving full accessibility compliance. Accessibility deferment addresses exception cases where immediate compliance is unfeasible. If you understand this concept, reply with \\"Yes, I understand!\\".","completion":"Yes, I understand! The \\"Accessibility Deferment\\" you've described is a policy or procedure allowing project teams within an organization to request a temporary exemption from full accessibility compliance for their products. This deferment is granted under specific conditions, such as when critical and high-severity accessibility defects cannot be resolved within the given time constraints or when there are extraordinary circumstances that justify a critical business need. The Accessibility Centre of Excellence (ACoE) in your organization considers these requests for deferment on a case-by-case basis, acknowledging that while the goal is to create fully accessible products, there are situations where immediate compliance may not be feasible. This process is designed to balance the commitment to accessibility with practical constraints, allowing for some flexibility while maintaining a structured approach to addressing and eventually resolving these accessibility issues."},{"prompt":"Here are some details on when to consider, when it is not needed and when it is not acceptable to use deferment: When to consider deferment: Deferment should only be considered when: • Technical limitations: Technical limitations of existing technology prevent immediate compliance. This allows time to research, adopt, or develop technologies that are more compatible with accessibility standards, ensuring long-term compliance. • Legal or regulatory conflict: Legal or regulatory requirements temporarily conflict with accessibility goals. This provides time to negotiate, adapt, or lobby for adjustment to regulations to align them with accessibility goals. • Changed standards/practices: Project was already underway before the establishment of an Accessibility Centre of Excellence or accessibility framework. This allows for a phased integration of accessibility into an existing project, acknowledging that it may not have been an initial consideration. • Third-party dependency: When there is a dependency on any third party and/or vendor-delivered component which is not accessibility compliant and there is no set duration defined for that component to be made accessible. When a deferment is not needed: An accessibility deferment is not needed in the following circumstances: • The product has no human-facing interface. • The product is special-purpose software that will be used by few individuals, none of whom have an identified disability that will be adversely affected by product accessibility issues. • The product is for use internally by a research team where no members of the team have an identified disability that will be adversely affected by product accessibility issues. Note: When a deferment is considered unnecessary for reasons such as those outlined earlier, it is imperative that such determinations be made in consultation with the Accessibility Centre of Excellence and a record made of this. When it is not acceptable to use a deferment • Lack of genuine effort: Deferment should always be coupled with a genuine and unwavering commitment to ensuring accessibility for all and should not be used as an excuse for a lack of effort. • Budgetary convenience: It is not acceptable to defer due to budget convenience alone. • Convenience over inclusion: Prioritizing convenience over inclusion is unacceptable when accessibility can be feasibly implemented. For instance, if a website’s design team opts for trendy but low-contrast color schemes to maintain aesthetics (while aware that this creates readability issues for users with visual impairments), it exemplifies prioritizing convenience over inclusion. • Recurring or preventable issues: Seeking deferment for recurring or preventable issues is counterproductive to the pursuit of accessibility excellence. For instance, consider a recurring color contrast issue where a team consistently encounters difficulties in achieving proper color contrast. This could indicate that they aren’t effectively integrating accessibility learnings into their development process. • No clear plan for resolution: The absence of a clear plan for barrier resolution is deemed unacceptable, especially when barriers to accessibility are identified within a project. If you understood the additional context of Accessibility deferment, reply \\"Yes, I understand\\".","completion":"Yes, I understand. The additional context you provided gives a more detailed view of the criteria and principles guiding the use of \\"Accessibility Deferment\\" within the Accessibility Centre of Excellence. The guidelines indicate when deferment should be considered, such as in cases of technical limitations, legal/regulatory conflicts, changes in standards, or third-party dependencies, and emphasizes that deferment is not a catch-all solution but a structured concession under specific circumstances. It is equally clear when deferment is not needed, such as for non-human-facing interfaces or special-purpose software used by a limited user base without accessibility needs. Moreover, you outline scenarios where deferment should not be acceptable, emphasizing that it is not a loophole for avoiding genuine efforts towards accessibility, nor is it an excuse for budgetary constraints, design choices that exclude certain users, repetitive issues, or a lack of clear plans to address identified barriers. The structured approach to Accessibility Deferment ensures that it is used appropriately and constructively, with the overarching goal of achieving full accessibility compliance in a sustainable and committed manner."},{"prompt":"Now here is the process Accessibility Centre of Excellence (ACoE) are trying to implement now. This process is not accessibility deferment but a different one: 1. ACoE will ask the project teams to provide Test completion reports (TCR) for their product which will be registered into the Accessibility register. This TCR will provide information how much they have invested in terms of accessibility, whether they have implemented accessibility into their product or not. 2. Once the product is registered into the accessibility register, the product team will release their product as per their schedule. 3. ACoE will analyze the TCR to figure out whether the accessibility has been achieved into their product. 4. This will be determined by ensuring whether their product is Fully compliant, partially compliant or Non-compliant. 5. If a product is Fully compliant, we say this is the \\"happy path\\" and hence no action needs to be taken. 6. If a product is either Partially compliant or Non-compliant, we determine the health of the product by analyzing the number of critical and high severity bugs which are not resolved. 7. Based on the above analysis, we create a \\"risk\\" inside the Risk Management System called \\"Archer\\". 8. Inside the \\"Archer\\", we raise \\"finding\\" as of why the current product poses risk (due to critical/high severity issues) and then ensure that the risk ownership goes to the Product Owner. 9. ACoE then creates \\"Action items\\" within the Archer which will tell the Product Owner what steps needs to be taken. 10. Once Product Owner analyzes this, he/she asks for additional training to the team in terms of accessibility. If you understand this new risk-based approach we are trying to implement, reply with \\"Yes, I understand\\".","completion":"Yes, I understand. The new process you've outlined represents a risk-based approach for assessing and managing accessibility within product development. It involves the Accessibility Centre of Excellence (ACoE) requiring project teams to submit a Test Completion Report (TCR) documenting accessibility efforts, followed by product release and subsequent analysis for determining compliance levels. For fully compliant products, no further actions are necessary. However, for partially compliant or non-compliant products, risks are assessed and recorded in the Risk Management System, \\"Archer,\\" with specific findings and action items being assigned to the Product Owner. This process also includes provisions for additional accessibility training for the team as needed. It's focused on accountability and continuous improvement in accessibility."},{"prompt":"Here is the expanded process of the above we discussed.: There are two views in this process: Front stage and Back stage. Here are the details of the \\"Front stage\\": WIthin the \\"Front stage\\", there can be two scenarios: 1. If a Product Owner (PO) is the user of Test Completion Reports (TCR): a. PO wants to release their product. b. Their team creates TCR. c. The release request goes to the ServiceNow (which is required for every release within the organization). d. ServiceNow has the option to provide accessibility attestation which will tell ACoE the overall status of product's accessibility. 2. If a Product Owner (PO) is not the user of Test Completion Reports (TCR) a. PO want to release their product. b. They don't have TCR (in this case, what they will do? This is entirely their responsibility.) c. The release request goes to the ServiceNow (which is required for every release within the organization). d. ServiceNow has the option to provide accessibility attestation which will tell ACoE the overall status of product's accessibility. Here are the details of the \\"Back stage\\": 1. Once the accessibility attestation has been recorded into the ServiceNow, check whether all the details are correct. 2. ACoE will \\"Sample check\\" or \\"Sample audit\\" their product to ensure that the claims raised by product team with respect to accessibility are correct or not. 3. If audit results shows that the product is sufficiently accessible (i.e. there aren't any critical or high severity accessibility bugs within their product), we can say that released product is accessible. 4. Product team is educated and motivated to fix the remaining Medium and Low severity bugs in their future releases. 5. On the other hand, if the audit results shows that the product is Non-accessible (i.e. there are critical and high severity bugs), the product is marked as Non-compliant. 6. In this case, we create a “risk” inside the Risk Management System called “Archer”. 7. Inside the “Archer”, we raise “finding” as of why the current product poses risk (due to critical/high severity issues) and then ensure that the risk ownership goes to the Product Owner. 8. ACoE then creates “Action items” within the Archer which will tell the Product Owner what steps needs to be taken. 9. Once Product Owner analyzes this, he/she asks for additional training to the team in terms of accessibility. Above is the process we have though which is the replacement of the accessibility deferment process we previously thought. I want you to analyze this complete process combined with the process I mentioned above and provide me your analysis. Analyze each and very aspect of the process and then provide me suggestions wherever required.","completion":"Based on the detailed breakdown of the revised accessibility process, here are some analytical insights and suggestions: # Front Stage: **Product Owner Using TCR:** a. The PO's intention to release their product with a TCR shows a commitment to accessibility. b. The creation of the TCR by their team promotes transparency and accountability. c. The integration of product release with ServiceNow ensures workflow standardization. d. Accessibility attestation within ServiceNow provides a quick overview for ACoE and aids in governance. **Product Owner Not Using TCR:** a. The possibility of releasing a product without a TCR may indicate a gap in the process or a lack of buy-in from the PO. b. This scenario requires clear guidelines and consequences for non-compliance to ensure POs are aware of their responsibilities. Suggestions for Front Stage: - **For POs not using TCR:** Implement mandatory training and awareness programs about the importance of accessibility to encourage proactive compliance. - **Enhance ServiceNow Workflow:** ServiceNow could flag releases without a TCR and prevent progress until a TCR is attached, enhancing compliance. - **Monitoring and Reporting:** Develop dashboards for monitoring the status of accessibility in real-time, which could lead to more proactive interventions. # Back Stage: 1. Verifying the attestation in ServiceNow reduces the risk of incorrect or incomplete information. 2. Random sampling and audits provide an additional layer of quality assurance and help validate the claims made in the TCR. 3. Sufficiently accessible products demonstrate the efficacy of the process and necessitate recognition to encourage best practices. 4. Encouraging the remediation of medium and low severity bugs in future releases fosters continuous improvement. Suggestions for Back Stage: - **Standardized Audit Processes:** Ensure consistency and fairness in audit sampling methods and outcomes. - **Provide Support for Compliance:** Instead of just identifying non-compliant products, also focus on providing support and resources to help teams achieve compliance. - **Clear Action Items and Timelines:** All action items created within Archer should come with clear timelines and explicit steps to resolve the issues. - **Leverage Insights from Non-compliance:** Use data from non-compliant cases to improve the education and training material, targeting frequent issues. - **Create a Feedback Loop:** Integrate lessons learned from audits back into initial product development stages to reduce future risks of non-compliance. - **Risk Ownership and Escalation:** There needs to be a clear pathway for escalation if Product Owners do not address the risks in a timely fashion. In summary, the new accessibility process seems to promote accountability and compliance while also providing a structure for addressing non-compliance. Still, it's crucial to ensure that the system isn't punitive but rather instructive and supportive, encouraging product teams to see accessibility as an integral part of product development rather than a mere regulatory hurdle. With the adoption of this process, it's important to monitor its effectiveness, gather feedback from stakeholders, and be willing to refine the system as needed to optimally support the goal of creating accessible products."},{"prompt":"Here are some additional explanation: 1. Product Owner using TCR: Explanation: The TCR they are creating is not exclusively for accessibility. The TCR includes the automation testing, functional testing and performance testing. We are proposing that that the accessibility details are included into the TCR. Based on this new information, refine your analysis and suggestions.","completion":"Understanding that the Test Completion Report (TCR) encompasses a broader scope of testing, including automation, functional, and performance testing, with accessibility details to be included, allows for a more integrated approach to product release. Here’s a refined analysis and suggestions: # Refined Front Stage Analysis: **Product Owner Using TCR:** a. The integration of accessibility details into a comprehensive TCR reflects a holistic approach to product quality. b. Including accessibility in the TCR ensures that it is considered alongside other critical quality factors. c. By embedding accessibility into the TCR, it reinforces the idea that accessibility is not an afterthought but a fundamental aspect of product development. # Refined Suggestions for Front Stage: - **Integration of Accessibility Testing:** Encourage the inclusion of accessibility as a default component of TCRs to promote its consideration early in the development process. - **Highlighting Accessibility in ServiceNow:** Modify ServiceNow to clearly display the accessibility status as part of the attestation, making it a highly visible aspect of the release procedure. - **Education and Resources:** Provide resources and training specifically on integrating accessibility into TCRs to ensure all involved parties understand the process and value. # Back Stage Remains Largely Unchanged: The back-stage process involving random audits and the management of compliance through the Risk Management System \\"Archer\\" still applies. Ensuring products meet accessibility standards remains the same, with the back-stage activities providing quality assurance and follow-up actions. # Additional Refined Suggestions considering the refined Front Stage process: - **Cross-disciplinary Training:** Given the inclusive comprehensive nature of TCRs, it's beneficial to provide cross-disciplinary training so that the team members become conversant with the principles and practices of accessibility. - **Reporting Granularity:** Develop ways to extract accessibility-specific insights from the TCR within ServiceNow, enabling targeted interventions for any accessibility issues. - **Accessibility Champions:** Consider appointing accessibility champions within product teams who can advocate for accessibility and ensure the quality of reporting within the TCR. - **Continuous Improvement:** Ensure that learning from the accessibility components of TCRs is fed back into a continuous improvement loop, helping to refine best practices and standards for accessibility in the context of multi-faceted quality assurance. - **Clear Documentation Guidelines:** Develop clear guidelines for what accessibility information should be included in TCRs and how it should be presented to enable consistent, accurate auditing, and risk assessment. Incorporating accessibility naturally into a broader QA framework signifies a mature approach to product development. It can help facilitate a culture where accessibility is seen as integral as functional correctness and performance."},{"prompt":"Since you have analysed everything I have provided, I want you provide me the final version of the process which ACoE should follow. Make it as detailed as possible.","completion":"Certainly! Based on the previous discussions, here is a detailed version of the accessibility compliance process that the Accessibility Centre of Excellence (ACoE) should follow: Accessibility Compliance Process # Front Stage Process: 1. **Pre-Release Preparation:** - Product Owners (POs) ensure that their teams include accessibility considerations throughout the product development lifecycle. - Teams integrate accessibility testing as part of their standard testing procedures, which then feeds into the Test Completion Report (TCR). 2. **Test Completion Report (TCR) Creation:** - TCRs must contain detailed sections on automation testing, functional testing, performance testing, and accessibility testing. - Accessibility sections should include data on compliance to standards (WCAG, etc.), identified issues, and the severity of those issues (critical, high, medium, low). 3. **Release Request through ServiceNow:** - All products undergoing release must file a release request in ServiceNow, including uploading the completed TCR. - ServiceNow should have a specific field or section for accessibility attestation based on the TCR’s accessibility content. 4. **Accessibility Attestation:** - POs responsible for the release must provide an attestation through ServiceNow, declaring the product's accessibility status based on the TCR. - ServiceNow captures this attestation for tracking and triggers notifications to ACoE for products identified with accessibility issues. # Back Stage Process: 1. **Record Verification:** - ACoE reviews the accessibility attestation within ServiceNow to verify that all information is correctly recorded. - Discrepancies or missing information in the TCR accessibility section should trigger follow-ups with the respective product team. 2. **Randomized Audits:** - ACoE conducts random audits or 'sample checks' on products to validate the accessibility claims put forth by the product teams in the TCR. - The focus of these audits is to assess compliance, with particular attention to unresolved critical and high-severity accessibility bugs. 3. **Audit Results - Compliance Assessment:** - **Fully Compliant Products:** - Products found to be fully compliant are recorded as such in ServiceNow and designated as a 'happy path' outcome. - Recognition of compliant teams could be encouraged to promote best practices. - **Partially Compliant or Non-compliant Products:** - Products falling into these categories are marked as 'non-compliant' in ServiceNow. - An assessment is made regarding the number of unresolved critical and high-severity bugs and their impact on accessibility. 4. **Risk Management:** - Non-compliant products have a risk case created within the Risk Management System, \\"Archer.\\" - \\"Findings\\" are documented in Archer, detailing the nature of the risk posed by unresolved accessibility issues. - Product owners are assigned risk ownership within Archer and notified of their responsibility to address these concerns. 5. **Action Items Creation:** - ACoE creates actionable tasks within Archer, delineating corrective steps the product owner must undertake to resolve the non-compliance. - Action items should include clear and realistic deadlines, necessary resources, and training needs. 6. **Education and Training:** - Based on the audit outcomes and Archer action items, product owners may request additional training for their teams. - ACoE coordinates accessibility training sessions and resources, focused on addressing common issues discovered in the audits and improving overall accessibility knowledge and expertise. # Continuous Monitoring and Improvement: - Monitoring dashboards within ServiceNow and Archer track the status of accessibility compliance, action items completion, and risk resolutions. - Regular reviews of the process are conducted to collect feedback and make iterative improvements. - Success stories and case studies of compliance are shared to foster a culture of inclusion and continuous learning. # Final Recommendations: - ACoE should maintain an up-to-date repository of accessibility resources, tools, guidelines, and best practices. - Regularly scheduled town hall meetings or forums could be held to discuss upcoming accessibility updates, share knowledge, and gather feedback. - Integration of customer feedback on accessibility into the product development and TCR process to ensure end-user needs are being addressed. This process is designed to be iterative and agile, with a strong emphasis on continuous learning and improvement, and aims to solidify accessibility as a cornerstone of quality assurance within the organization."},{"prompt":"I want to provide a overall context to my client regarding a problem we are facing in the RLG organization.

Also, we want to make sure that they have implemented accessibility even if they haven't contacted ACoE. For this, ACoE want to include the Accessibility Attestation part. What this means is that project team need to create accessibility attestation. This attestation will include all the details like accessibility standards used for testing (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level A, AA, AAA or WCAG 2.2), a summary of the total number of accessibility issues identified during testing, state the number of unresolved issues within each severity level (critical, high, medium, low), remediation plan in case of partially compliant products. We don't want to risk the release of the product due to accessibility. This means we want to ensure that product is released but they accessibility effort is recorded. Now, your task is to first analyze the release process then analyze the above process which we want to implement and then provide me the following details: 1. Whether the TCR should have a checkbox(s) that accessibility details have been recorded. 2. When during the release process, the accessibility attestation record should be raised. (Keep in mind that the entire Release process I mentioned above is raised in the ServiceNow platform so we want to raise the accessibility attestation record in the ServiceNow as well. 3. If the accessibility attestation record is not added as part of release process or TCR, whether the product should be allowed to release or not.","completion":"Analyzing both the existing release process and the proposed inclusion of an Accessibility Attestation, here are my recommendations: # Regarding TCR and Accessibility Checkboxes: Given that the TCR is a crucial document that outlines all testing completed, it should indeed have sections or checkboxes indicating that accessibility testing has been conducted. These could include: 1. A checkbox confirming that accessibility testing per the applicable WCAG standards has been completed. 2. Fields to state the number of unresolved issues by severity level (if any). 3. A field summarizing the remediation plan for any outstanding issues, including timelines and responsible parties. The TCR could also have a mandatory sign-off on the accessibility portion to ensure accountability and focus on this important area. # Timing for Raising Accessibility Attestation: The Accessibility Attestation should be included as an integral part of the release process in ServiceNow, and here are strategic points at which it could be incorporated: 1. **During TCR Finalization:** - When the Product Owner (PO) ensures that the TCR is complete (Step 3 of the release process), this is an ideal time to also complete the Accessibility Attestation. - An attestation template could be included in ServiceNow as part of the TCR, to be filled out and submitted along with it. 2. **Before Change Request Approval:** - The Accessibility Attestation should be confirmed before the PO raises the Change Request in ServiceNow (Step 4 of the release process). - As the Change Request is being filed, ServiceNow should enforce a dependency that checks for the completion of the Accessibility Attestation before the request can be raised. 3. **During Release Pipeline Approval:** - Before the Release Manager approves the release pipeline (Step 7 of the release process), there should be a validation step within the automated pipeline to check if the Accessibility Attestation is completed. - ServiceNow could have a business rule or workflow condition to ensure the attestation is provided before the release pipeline gets final approval. # Product Release Without Accessibility Attestation: The decision to permit the release of a product without an Accessibility Attestation depends on the governance policy of the organization. Here are the options for consideration: 1. **Strict Governance Approach:** - If a product doesn't have an Accessibility Attestation, it cannot be released. This enforces the commitment to accessibility and aligns with a zero-tolerance policy for non-compliance. 2. **Lenient Governance Approach:** - Allow the release to proceed but flag it as \\"at risk\\" or \\"non-compliant\\", triggering a mandatory remediation plan with clear timelines and responsibilities for resolving accessibility issues immediately after release. 3. **Hybrid Governance Approach:** - Permit the release if only low-severity accessibility issues are pending, but prevent release for any critical or high-severity issues. - Ensure that any unresolved issues are documented along with a strong, enforceable commitment from the Product Owner for post-release remediation. The approach taken should be a policy decision made collectively by the ACoE, Release Management, and other stakeholders. It's crucial that whatever policy is established, it is clearly communicated across the organization and enforced consistently to maintain the integrity of the release process and uphold accessibility standards. ServiceNow can be configured to support these policies through customized workflows, mandatory fields, conditional logic, and documented approvals that enforce the completion of the Accessibility Attestation prior to release."},{"prompt":"What type of digital product receives permanent exception for accessibility compliance?","completion":"In general, accessibility compliance should be a goal for all digital products to ensure that they are usable by as wide a range of people as possible, including those with disabilities. However, there may be rare cases where a permanent exception might be considered for specific types of digital products. These exceptions are typically tied to very specific and often rare use cases: 1. **Legacy Systems:** - Products that are based on legacy systems which are scheduled to be phased out and replaced might receive an exception, particularly if retrofitting for accessibility would require an unreasonable level of effort or cost relative to the remaining lifespan of the system. 2. **Control Interfaces Not Meant for General Use:** - Specialized equipment interfaces that aren’t intended for general public use, and are only utilized by trained personnel, might be exempt. Even in such cases, accessibility should be considered for employees with disabilities. 3. **Security-Critical Systems:** - Systems that prioritize security concerns might have aspects that cannot be made fully accessible due to technical constraints. That said, efforts should be made to make such systems accessible to the extent possible without compromising security. 4. **Non-User Interfaces:** - Systems that do not have a user interface, or interfaces that are purely for machine-to-machine communication, might not be subject to the same accessibility standards. 5. **Single-User Software:** - Software designed for a specific individual, who does not require accessibility features, may be given an exception. Example: A tool developed for use by one person without disabilities in a research setting. 6. **Ultra-Niche Market Products:** - Products developed for an extremely small, specialized market where there are no users with disabilities may occasionally be granted exceptions. It’s essential to note that for any digital product seeking a permanent exception from accessibility compliance, review and approval are generally required from an overseeing body or regulatory authority. The organization must typically provide robust justification as to why accessibility cannot be reasonably achieved. In cases where temporary exemptions are granted, there should be a plan for eventual compliance. The legal framework for these exceptions is dependent on jurisdiction. For example, in the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) doesn't explicitly allow for permanent exceptions, though there may be a consideration of \\"undue burden\\" for compliance. In contrast, federal websites and digital products are subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which contains more clearly defined exceptions and standards for compliance. All considerations around exemptions should be approached with caution, prioritizing inclusive practices and looking for reasonable accommodations and modifications that can be made to increase accessibility wherever possible."},{"prompt":"Zihin felsefesinde kaç tane fizikalizm çeşidi var ve bunlar: 1- hangi tarihlerde ortaya atıldı, kronolojik olarak sırala, 2- hangi problemlere çözüm getirebilmek amacıyla ortaya atıldı, 3- hangi tezlerle birbirinden ayırt edilir?","completion":"Zihin felsefesinde fizikalizm, genel olarak zihinsel durumların, olayların veya özelliklerin fiziksel durumlar, olaylar veya özelliklerle eşit ya da bunların işlevsel (işleyişsel) sonucu olduğu fikrini savunur. Fizikalizmin birkaç çeşidi vardır ve her biri belirli tarihlerde ortaya atılmış, farklı sorunlara çözüm bulunması amacıyla tasarlanmış ve çeşitli tezlerle birbirinden ayrılmaktadır. 1. Redüktif Fizikalizm / Yapılandırmacılık (1950'ler-1960'lar): Bu yaklaşım, zihni tamamen fiziksel terimlerle açıklamayı ve zihinsel olayları beyin olaylarının veya işlemlerinin bir türü olarak görmeyi amaçlar. Basit terimlerle, \\"zihinsel durum\\" dediğimiz şeyin beyindeki fiziksel durumların açıklamasıyla redükte edilebileceğini öne sürer. Bu görüşün önemli temsilcileri arasında U.T. Place, J.J.C. Smart ve Herbert Feigl bulunmaktadır. 2. Yapılandırmacılık sonrası Fizikalizm / İşlevselcilik (1960'lar-1970'ler): Zihinsel durumların fiziksel durumlarla aynı olmadığını, ancak fiziksel durumlarca gerçekleştirilen belirli işlevler olduğunu savunur. Bu yaklaşım, Hilary Putnam ve Jerry Fodor gibi filozoflar tarafından tanıtılmıştır ve zihnin belirli bir tür fiziksel maddeye bağlı olmadığını; farklı maddelerin aynı işlevi gerçekleştirmesiyle zihinsel durumların oluşabileceğini öne sürer. İşlevselcilik, çok çeşitli fiziksel gerçekleştirici sistemlerde (örneğin insanların beyinleri, bilgisayarlar vs.) benzer zihinsel özelliklerin ortaya çıkabileceğini iddia eder. 3. Yoketmeci Fizikalizm / Yoketmecilik (1960'lar-1970'ler): Richard Rorty ve Paul Feyerabend gibi düşünürler tarafından savunulan bu yaklaşım, zihinsel terimlerin ve kavramların bilimsel açıklamaların dışında bırakılması ve yalnızca fiziksel açıklamaların kullanılması gerektiğini savunur. 4. Yoketmecilikten ayrı olarak Dan Dennett gibi filozoflar, bireyin zihinsel durumlarını anlamak için gereken \\"hikâyeler\\" olduğu ve bu hikayelerin yararlı heuristikler sunduğunu, ancak ontolojik olarak zihinsel durumların fiziksel olaylardan bağımsız bir varlık taşımadığını öne sürer. 5. Yapılandırmacılık (1990'lar-2000'ler): Bu yaklaşım sonradan ortaya çıkmıştır ve belirli zihinsel durumların, beyindeki spesifik nörobiyolojik durumlarla eşlediğini savunur. Jaegwon Kim gibi filozoflar bu konudaki düşünceleriyle tanınırlar. Her bir fizikalizm türü, zihin ve beyin arasındaki ilişkiyi açıklamak, zihinsel fenomenlerin doğası gibi zihin felsefesinin temel problemlerine yaklaşımlarını ve çözümlerini sunar. Ayrıca, zihinsel durumların özgünlüğü, bilincin doğası, zihnin maddenin bir özelliği olup olmadığı gibi konularda farklı tezler ileri sürerler."},{"prompt":"i am getting this code error: \\"\\"PS C:Python Projects 2024> python app.py Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"C:Python Projects 2024app.py\\", line 20, in <module> docs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"C:Python Projects 2024app.py\\", line 20, in <listcomp> docs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"C:UsersbowerAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython311Libsite-packageslangchain_coredocument_loadersbase.py\\", line 29, in load return list(self.lazy_load()) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"C:UsersbowerAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython311Libsite-packageslangchain_communitydocument_loadersweb_base.py\\", line 249, in lazy_load soup = self._scrape(path, bs_kwargs=self.bs_kwargs) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"C:UsersbowerAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython311Libsite-packageslangchain_communitydocument_loadersweb_base.py\\", line 218, in _scrape from bs4 import BeautifulSoup ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bs4' PS C:Python Projects 2024>\\"\\"","completion":"The error message you're seeing, \`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bs4'\`, indicates that your Python environment does not have the \`bs4\` package installed.

From the output you've provided: 1. **Before RAG**: The model does not seem to recognize the term \\"Ollama\\" within its corpus of understanding and thus is asking for more context or a spell check. This might indicate that the term is either not present in its training data or the context provided was insufficient for it to generate a relevant response. The chat model (\`ChatOllama\`) is replying that it cannot find specific information about \\"Ollama.\\" 2. **After RAG**: You're seeing a message that says, \\"Number of requested results 4 is greater than number of elements in index 3, updating n_results = 3.\\" This message probably comes from the retriever. It seems to be trying to fetch a certain number of documents (4 in this case) based on the search query or the retrieval process, but it can only find 3 documents that match the criteria in the vector store (possibly due to a lack of data or filtered results that match the query). Since your script is running and outputs are being printed to the console, it looks like your code is functioning. The messages you see are responses from the chat model and the retriever, which may be as expected depending on the data they have to work with and how they've been designed to respond to queries. If you think the number of results returned by the retriever is incorrect or not what you expect, you may want to check the content of your document indexes, ensure your data-fed to the retriever is correct, and verify that the retriever's logic is configured correctly. If there are any parameters or configurations that control the number of expected results, you should adjust them according to the available data or required behavior."},{"prompt":"but the data is in step 1 : \\"\\"# 1.

You've provided a step where it loads documents from specified URLs and then splits those documents into chunks. If you're certain that all URLs are successfully returning content and that the \`WebBaseLoader\` is correctly retrieving the data, the error message you received in the second part (\\"After RAG\\") may not be about the initial data retrieval but rather about how that data is handled in subsequent steps. Specifically, the message \`Number of requested results 4 is greater than number of elements in index 3, updating n_results = 3\` seems to come from the retrieval process where the system was asked to retrieve 4 results, but only 3 chunks were available in the vector store. This discrepancy could arise for a number of reasons: 1. **Insufficient data**: Not enough text was extracted from the URLs to make up to 4 separate chunks when split. This would mean the splitting process or the content of the URLs did not result in at least 4 distinct pieces of text based on the chunk size and overlap you specified. 2. **Indexing issues**: There may have been a problem when indexing the chunks in the \`vectorstore\`, or it somehow didn't register all the chunks you expected it to. It's worth checking to ensure the indexing process is completed successfully, and all chunks are indeed being stored. 3. **Configuration**: The retriever may be incorrectly configured to expect more results than are actually available. Here's a suggestion for debugging: - After splitting the documents, print the number of chunks you get to verify that there are at least as many as you are asking the retriever to return. For example, right after the \`split_documents\` call, insert: \`\`\`python print(f\\"Number of document splits: {len(doc_splits)}\\") \`\`\` - Make sure the chunks are being successfully converted into embeddings and stored in the \`vectorstore\`. You can do this by verifying the content of the \`vectorstore\` after this line: \`\`\`python vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(...) \`\`\` It's important to confirm each step of your process is behaving as expected. If any step fails or behaves differently than anticipated, it can cause issues downstream in your pipeline. If you have logging for these intermediate steps or if you can insert print statements, you will have a better idea of where the problem might be occurring."},{"prompt":"how do i modify the following code to create embeddings from a local folder containing a pdf on desktop? : \\"\\"from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma from langchain_community import embeddings from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter model_local = ChatOllama(model=\\"dolphin.mistral\\") # 1.

Here's an example of how you can do this, step by step: 1. **Import the necessary classes**: Since you'll be using \`DirectoryLoader\` and \`TextLoader\`, you should make sure to import them: \`\`\`python from langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader # or PyPDFLoader, if you are dealing with PDF files \`\`\` 2. **Update the code to load documents from a local directory**: You'll need to specify the local directory path where the PDF file is located on your desktop. Replace \`'path_to_your_directory'\` with the actual path to the directory containing the PDF. \`\`\`python # Specify the path to the directory containing the PDF directory_path = 'C:UsersYourUsernameDesktopYourPDFfolder' # Update this to the correct path # Instantiate a DirectoryLoader, specifying the directory and the loader class (PyPDFLoader for PDFs) loader = DirectoryLoader(directory_path, glob=\\"*.pdf\\", loader_cls=PyPDFLoader) # Load the documents docs = loader.load() \`\`\` 3. **Remove or comment out the web scraping code**: Since you're now loading a PDF document from a local directory, the code that fetches documents from URLs is no longer necessary. Comment it out or remove it: \`\`\`python # URLs code no longer needed # urls = [ # \\"https://ollama.com/\\", # \\"https://ollama.com/blog/windows-preview\\", # \\"https://ollama.com/blog/openai-compatibility\\", # ] # docs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls] # docs_list = [item for sublist in docs for item in sublist] \`\`\` 4. **Split the loaded document into chunks and create embeddings**: Continue with the processing as before, ensuring to correctly handle the splits and embedding creation: \`\`\`python # Assuming docs is now a list of documents loaded from the PDFs # Flatten the list of lists (in case docs is a list of lists) docs_list = [item for sublist in docs for item in sublist] # Split the document text into chunks text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(chunk_size=7500, chunk_overlap=100) doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_list) # Continue with embedding creation... vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(...) \`\`\` 5. **Run the script**: Once you've made these adjustments, try running your script again with \`python app.py\` and check if the embeddings are successfully created from your local PDF document. Remember to carefully adapt paths, filenames, and other parameters as needed for your specific environment and files.

I'll provide you with a brief explanation of what each method seems to be doing in the code snippet provided and if there's any improvement that could be made to enhance the code readability and performance. - \`ngOnInit\`: This lifecycle hook is called once, after the component's data-bound properties have been initialized. Inside this method, two helper methods are being called to fetch drivers and vehicles, probably from an API. - \`constructor\`: This is where the component's dependencies \`VehiculeService\`, \`ToastrService\`, and \`DriverService\` are being injected. - \`getDrivers\`: Fetches a list of drivers using the \`driverService\` and assigns the data to the \`drivers\` property. It also logs the response to the console, which should generally be avoided in production code. - \`getVehicules\`: Fetches a list of vehicles using the \`vehiculeService\` and assigns the data to the \`vehicules\` property. Again, console logging should be avoided in production environments. - \`onSubmitVehicule\`: Validates the vehicle form and either inserts a new vehicle or updates an existing one, depending on whether the \`Id\` is 0 or not. - \`insertVehicule\`: Uses the \`vehiculeService\` to post a new vehicle and handles the Toast notifications for success or error. - \`resetForm\`: Resets the form and reinitializes the form values to their defaults. - \`ChangeModele\`: Resets the \`Modele\` form control to an empty string. Regarding improvements and best practices: 1. Remove \`console.log\` statements or replace them with a proper logging service if you need to log information for debugging or monitoring. Direct use of \`console\` methods is not recommended for production environments. 2. Instead of setting default values directly in \`resetForm\`, it's a good idea to maintain a separate method or object containing default form values to avoid redundancy and to make changes easier in the future. 3. It's a good practice to handle HTTP errors gracefully by giving more context to the user rather than a generic error message. 4. Type your properties and variables. Instead of using \`any\` for \`drivers\` and \`vehicules\`, create interfaces that match the expected objects. This enhances maintainability and type checking. 5. The commented out method \`onDateAchatChange\` is not used, so it should be removed if it’s not needed. 6. The toastr service injection name should be lowercase (\`toast\` -> \`toastrService\`) to maintain consistency and readability. 7. There seems to be a \`ViewChild\` instance of \`MatSelect\` that isn’t being used; if it's unnecessary, it should be removed. Please note that without the complete context of your application (like the form structure in \`VehiculeService\` or the implementation of the services like \`getDrivers()\`), these suggestions are based on the provided code and general Angular best practices."},{"prompt":"The yield of a bond cannot be found by: Group of answer choices An Internal Rate of Return (IRR) function Algebraic manipulation Numerical methods Manual trial and error iteration Automated trial and error iteration (e.g. \\"Goal Seek\\")","completion":"The yield of a bond can indeed be found using all the methods listed: 1. An Internal Rate of Return (IRR) function: Yield to maturity (YTM) on a bond can be calculated with an IRR function, as the IRR is essentially a time-weighted annualized return figure which is similar to the YTM. 2. Algebraic manipulation: It is possible to use algebra to solve for the yield of a bond by setting the present value of all future cash flows equal to the bond's price. However, since bond yield calculations involve solving for the variable in an exponential equation, algebraic manipulation might not always provide an exact solution, and numerical methods might be employed for more precision. 3. Numerical methods: Methods such as the Newton-Raphson or bisection methods can be used to numerically estimate the yield of a bond to a high degree of accuracy. 4. Manual trial and error iteration: Although potentially time-consuming, a person can manually adjust the yield figure until the present value of the bond's cash flows at that yield equals the bond's price. 5. Automated trial and error iteration (e.g., \\"Goal Seek\\" in Excel): Automated software tools can rapidly iterate through possible yields until finding the one that sets the present value of the bond's cash flows equal to its price. All these methods are valid techniques for calculating the yield of a bond.

Let's break down the phrase into its components for a detailed understanding: 1. \\"Além\\" – This word comes from the merging of the Latin preposition \\"ad\\" (to, towards) and \\"illam\\" (that), evolving into \\"além\\" in Portuguese. It literally means \\"beyond\\" or \\"on the other side of.\\" - \\"Além\\" refers to something that is beyond a certain point, either in a physical sense (like going beyond a certain location) or in a metaphorical sense (like going beyond a certain topic or idea). 2. \\"disso\\" – This is a contraction of two elements: \\"de\\" + \\"isso.\\" - \\"de\\" is a preposition which can mean \\"of,\\" \\"from,\\" or \\"about,\\" depending on context. - \\"isso\\" is a demonstrative pronoun meaning \\"that.\\" - When combined, \\"disso\\" translates to \\"of that\\" or \\"about that,\\" but it can also be seen as pointing to a previously mentioned subject or topic. Putting the two parts together, \\"além disso\\" connects back to something previously mentioned and adds further information about it. It's important to note that while \\"além disso\\" functions similarly to the English \\"besides that\\" or \\"furthermore,\\" it often implies that the additional information is not just a casual addition but something that reinforces or expands on the original point. Usage in a sentence: - Portuguese: \\"A cidade é muito bonita. Além disso, oferece várias atrações culturais.\\" - English Translation: \\"The city is very beautiful. Furthermore, it offers various cultural attractions.\\" In this sentence, \\"além disso\\" is used to introduce further positive information that complements what has already been said about the city."},{"prompt":"Abragendo; abrigando; explain please and make it a detailed breakdown","completion":"The words \\"abragendo\\" and \\"abrigando\\" are two Portuguese words that may sound similar but have different meanings and uses. Let's break them down for a clearer understanding. **Abrangendo** 1. **Root Word**: \\"Abranger\\" is the infinitive form from which \\"abragendo\\" is derived. The infinitive \\"abranger\\" means \\"to encompass,\\" \\"to cover,\\" or \\"to include.\\" 2. **Conjugation**: \\"Abrangendo\\" is the gerund form of \\"abranger.\\" In Portuguese, the gerund is used to express an ongoing action, similar to the English present participle ending in \\"-ing.\\" - \\"Abranger\\" (to encompass) → \\"Abrangendo\\" (encompassing) 3. **Usage**: This form is used to indicate an action that is happening at the moment it's being described, or it is used generally to talk about actions that happen concurrently with other actions. - Sentence Example: \\"O estudo está abrangendo vários aspectos da linguagem.\\" (The study is encompassing various aspects of the language.) **Abrigando** 1. **Root Word**: \\"Abrigando\\" comes from the infinitive \\"abrigar,\\" which means \\"to shelter,\\" \\"to harbor,\\" or \\"to protect.\\" 2. **Conjugation**: Similar to \\"abragendo,\\" \\"abrigando\\" is the gerund form of \\"abrigar\\" and conveys ongoing action. - \\"Abrigar\\" (to shelter) → \\"Abrigando\\" (sheltering) 3. **Usage**: \\"Abrigando\\" is used when discussing the act of providing shelter or protection to someone or something. - Sentence Example: \\"Eles estão abrigando animais abandonados.\\" (They are sheltering abandoned animals.) Each of these verbs belongs to different semantic fields: \\"abranger\\" is about including or covering a breadth of items or concepts, while \\"abrigar\\" is concerned with offering protection or a place of safety. Despite the similarities in their gerund forms, they represent distinct actions and concepts."},{"prompt":"\\"grileiros\\" what does it mean?","completion":"\\"Grileiros\\" is a Brazilian Portuguese term used to describe people who engage in \\"grilagem,\\" an illegal practice of land grabbing or land fraud. The word originates from \\"grilo,\\" which means \\"cricket,\\" but in this context, it refers not to the insect but to a fraudulent method historically tied to land acquisition. Here's a breakdown of what \\"grileiros\\" represent: 1. **Illicit Land Claiming**: Grileiros are known for falsifying documents to illegitimately claim ownership of land. This practice is particularly common in rural areas where land ownership records may be outdated or poorly maintained, allowing for documentation to be manipulated. 2. **Document Forgery**: One of the techniques said to be used by grileiros involves the artificial aging of land titles or property documents. As legend has it, they would place fake land documents in a drawer with crickets (\\"grilos\\") whose droppings and movement would give the papers an aged appearance, making the documents seem old and, therefore, authentic. 3. **Conflict and Disputes**: The actions of grileiros often lead to land conflicts, particularly in areas like the Amazon rainforest, where they might try to seize public or unclaimed land, as well as lands belonging to indigenous communities or small farmers. These disputes can result in violence and environmental destruction, as grileiros might clear vast sections of forest to establish their claims. 4. **Social and Legal Issues**: The presence and activities of grileiros have significant implications for social stability, environmental conservation, and the rule of law. Efforts to combat land grabbing and protect legitimate land ownership can be complex and are ongoing challenges in regions affected by grilagem. 5. **Contemporary Relevance**: In current times, the term \\"grileiro\\" is broadly associated with land occupation and exploitation issues and can sometimes be used to refer to large agricultural companies or individuals who are perceived as unfairly exploiting land resources, even if the precise methods differ from the traditional grilagem. In summary, \\"grileiros\\" represents a specific and controversial group involved in land-related fraud and conflict, with the term carrying considerable historical and social weight in Brazil."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
