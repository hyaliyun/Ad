In this work we show that, with a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a small number of API queries (e.g., costing under 1,000 for OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We exploit this fact to unlock several capabilities: efficiently discovering the LLM’s hidden size, obtaining cheap full-vocabulary outputs, detecting and disambiguating different model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even estimating the output layer parameters. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4,096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability. 1Introduction As large language models (LLMs) have become more capable and valuable, it has become increasingly common for companies and organizations to train closed-source LLMs and make them available only via an API (e.g., OpenAI et al., 2024). This setup may foster a false sense of security for LLM providers, who might mistakenly assume that information about their model architecture is private, and that certain types of attacks on their LLM are infeasible. On the flip side, users must seemingly take providers’ word that LLMs only change when the provider publicly announces version updates. Refer to caption Figure 1: LLM outputs are constrained to a low-dimensional subspace of the full output space. We can use this fact to glean information about API-protected LLMs by analyzing their outputs. Here we show how a toy LLM’s low-dimensional embeddings in ℝ � (illustrated here as a 1-D space) are transformed linearly into logits in ℝ � (here, a 3D space) via the softmax matrix 𝑾 . The resulting outputs lie within a ( � = 1 )-dimensional subspace of the output space. The softmax function also preserves this low-dimensionality when transforming the logits into probabilities distributions on Δ � . We call this low-dimensional subspace the image of the model. We can obtain a basis for the image of an API-protected LLM by collecting � of its outputs. The LLM’s image can reveal non-public information, such as the LLM’s embedding size, but it can also be used for accountability, such as verifying which LLM an API is serving. Despite this apparent state of affairs, in reality many LLM APIs reveal much more information about their underlying models than previously thought. In this paper we show how to extract detailed information about LLM parameterization using only common API configurations. Our findings allow LLM clients to hold providers accountable by tracking model changes, recovering hidden prompts and cheaply obtaining full vocabulary outputs. At the same time, our approach also allows LLM providers to establish unique identities for their models, enabling trust with their users as well as improved accountability. Table 1 summarizes the applications that we explore in this paper. Table 1:An overview of our proposed applications that exploit LLM images. Application Section Efficiently extract full LLM outputs. 3 Find the embedding size of an LLM and guess its parameter count. 4 Identify which LLM produced a given output. 5 Detect when and what type of LLM updates occur. 5.1 Find tokenization bugs (unargmaxable tokens). 6.1 Approximately reconstruct the LLM’s softmax matrix. 6.2 Cheaply and accurately reconstruct “hidden prompts”. 6.3 Implement basis-aware decoding algorithms. 6.4 Our method exploits the low-rank output layer common to most LLM architectures by observing that this layer’s outputs are constrained to a low-dimensional subspace of the full output space, as illustrated in Figure 1. We call this restricted output space the LLM’s image. We can obtain a basis for this image by collecting a small number of LLM outputs, and we develop novel algorithms that enable us to accomplish this cheaply and quickly for standard LLM APIs. Obtaining the LLM image (§2) allows to explore several capabilities that cover a broad set applications, and empirically verify several of them. For instance, we design and empirically verify an algorithm for finding the embedding size of an API-based LLM, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by estimating the embedding size of gpt-3.5-turbo, a closed-source API-protected LLM, to be 4,096. We also empirically show effectiveness of using LLM images as unique signatures that can be used to identify outputs from a model with high accuracy, a useful property for API LLM accountability. The sensitivity of these signatures to slight changes in the LLM parameters also makes them suitable for inferring granular information about model parameter updates. Considering several proposals to mitigate this vulnerability, we find no obvious fix to prevent obtaining LLM images without dramatically altering the LLM architecture. While providers may choose to alter the API to hide this information, the relevant API features have valuable and safe use cases for the LLM clients, who may rely on access to features like logit bias. Though our findings be viewed as a warning to LLM providers to carefully consider the consequences of their LLM architectures and APIs, we prefer to view our findings as a potential feature that LLM providers may choose to keep in order to better maintain trust with their customers by allowing outside observers to audit their model. 2LLM outputs are restricted to a low-dimensional linear space Refer to caption Figure 2: A typical language model architecture. After the input its processed by a neural network, usually a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), into a low-dimensional embedding 𝒉 , it is multiplied by the softmax matrix 𝑾 , projecting it linearly from ℝ � onto ℝ � to obtain the logit vector ℓ . The softmax function is then applied to the logit vector to obtain a valid probability distribution 𝒑 over next-token candidates. Consider the architecture of a typical LLM, depicted in Figure 2. A Transformer with embedding size � outputs a low-dimensional contextualized embedding 𝒉 ∈ ℝ � (or simply embedding). Projecting the embedding onto ℝ � via the linear map defined by the LLM’s softmax matrix 𝑾 , we obtain the logits ℓ = 𝑾 ⁢ 𝒉 . Because 𝑾 is in ℝ � × � , its rank (i.e., number of linearly independent columns) is at most � . The rank of a matrix corresponds to the dimension of the image of the linear map it defines, i.e., the vector space comprising the set of possible outputs of the function. In other words, if the linear map � is defined as � ⁢ ( 𝒉 ) = 𝑾 ⁢ 𝒉 , then � ’s image im ⁡ ( � ) = { � ⁢ ( 𝒉 ) ∈ ℝ � : 𝒉 ∈ ℝ � } is a � -dimensional subspace of ℝ � . Thus, the LLM’s logits will always lie on the � -dimensional1 subspace of ℝ � . Refer to captionRefer to captionRefer to captionRefer to caption Figure 3: Points in the logit space ℝ � (far left) are mapped via the softmax function to points (probability distributions) on the simplex Δ � (middle left). Crucially, the softmax maps all points that lie on the same diagonal (shown as points of the same color) to the same probability distribution. For numerical stability, these values are often stored as log-probabilities (middle right). The clr transform returns probability distributions to points to a subspace � � of the logit space (far right). The softmax function and clr transform are inverses of one another, and form an isomorphism between � � and Δ � . We now turn our attention to the LLM’s final output: the next-token distribution 𝒑 . Due to the softmax function, this is a valid probability distribution over � items, meaning it is a � -tuple of real numbers between 0 and 1 whose sum is 1 . The set of valid probability distributions over � items is referred to as the � -simplex, or Δ � . Perhaps surprisingly, Δ � is also a valid vector space (albeit under a non-standard definition of addition and scalar multiplication) and is isomorphic to a ( � − 1 ) -dimensional vector subspace of ℝ � (Aitchison, 1982; Leinster, 2016). In particular, it is isomorphic to the hyperplane � � that is perpendicular to the all-ones vector 𝟏 � , as illustrated in Figure 3. The softmax function is thus an isomorphism � � → Δ � whose inverse mapping Δ � → � � is the center log ratio transform (clr), which is defined as clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) = log ⁡ 𝒑 ( ∏ � = 1 � � � ) 1 � = log ⁡ 𝒑 − 1 � ⁢ ∑ � = 1 � log ⁡ � � . (1) Observe also that the function ℓ ↦ clr ⁡ ( softmax ⁡ ( ℓ ) ) projects ℓ linearly onto the nearest point in � � . By this linearity, and the fact that im ⁡ ( � ) is a � -dimensional subspace of ℝ � , we can observe that im ⁡ ( softmax ∘ � ) and im ⁡ ( clr ∘ softmax ∘ � ) are also a � -dimensional vector subspaces of Δ � and � � ⊂ ℝ � respectively. Interpreted, this means that the LLM’s outputs occupy � -dimensional subspaces of the logit space ℝ � , probability space Δ � , and � � . We call these subspaces the image of the LLM on each given space. A natural consequence of the low-dimensional output space is that any collection of � linearly independent LLM outputs 𝒑 1 , 𝒑 2 , … , 𝒑 � form a basis for the image of the model, i.e., all LLM outputs can be expressed as a unique linear combination of these � outputs (Yang et al., 2018; Finlayson et al., 2023). The rest of this paper discusses the implications and applications of this mathematical fact for API-protected LLMs, starting with methods for finding the LLM image given a restrictive API, then using the LLM image for various purposes. 3Fast, full outputs from API-protected LLMs There are several uses for full-vocab LLM outputs, however most LLM APIs do not return full outputs. This is likely because full outputs are large and expensive to send over an API, but could also be to prevent abuse of APIs, such as using these outputs to distill models (Hinton et al., 2015; Mukherjee and Awadallah, 2019; Hsieh et al., 2023) or discover proprietary information (see Section 4). In their paper, Morris et al. (2023) give an algorithm for recovering these full outputs from restricted APIs by taking advantage of a common API option that allows users to add bias to the logits for specific tokens. The algorithm they describe requires � ⁢ ( � ⁢ log ⁡ 1 � ) calls to the API top obtain one full output with precision � . We give an improvement that theoretically obtains full outputs in � / � API calls for APIs that return the log-probability of the top- � tokens. We find that this improved algorithm suffers from numerical instability, and give a numerially stable algorithm that obtains full outputs in � / ( � − 1 ) API calls. Next, we give a practical algorithm for dealing with stochastic APIs that randomly choose outputs from a set of � possible outputs. This algorithm allows the collection of full outputs in less than � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) API calls on average. Finally, we reduce the number of API calls in all of the above algorithms from � ⁢ ( � ) to � ⁢ ( � ) by adding in a preprocessing step to find the low-dimensional image of the LLM. This speedup makes obtaining full LLM outputs up to 100 times faster and cheaper, depending on the LLM. Table 2 gives an overview of our algorithms with back-of-the envelope cost estimates for a specific LLM. Table 2: A summary of our proposed algorithms, with estimates for the number of API calls required per output, and the price of acquiring the model image. Estimates are based on a gpt-3.5-turbo-like API LLM with � = 100 ⁢ K , � = 4096 , � = 10 − 6 , � = 5 , � max = 100 , and � = 4 . Note that the � ⁢ ( � ) algorithm cannot be used to obtain the LLM image, since it relies on having LLM image as a preprocessing step. Algorithm Complexity API calls per output Image price Logprob-free � ⁢ ( � ⁢ log ⁡ 1 � ) 800K 16,384 With logprobs � / � 20K 410 Numerically stable � / ( � − 1 ) 25K 512 Stochastically robust � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) 133K 2,724 LLM Image � ⁢ ( � ) 1K–32K - 3.1Fast, full outputs from APIs with logprobs Our goal is to recover a full-vocabulary next-token distribution 𝒑 ∈ Δ � from an API-protected LLM. We will assume that the API accepts a prompt on which to condition the distribution, as well as a list of up to � tokens and a bias term � ≤ � max to add to the logits of the listed tokens before applying the softmax function. The API returns a record with the � most likely tokens and their probabilities from the biased distribution. For instance, querying the API with � maximally biased tokens, which without loss of generality we will identify as tokens 1 , 2 , … , � , yields the top- � most probable tokens from the biased distribution 𝒑 ′ = softmax ⁡ ( ℓ ′ ) where ℓ � ′ = { ℓ � + � max � ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , � } ℓ � otherwise and ℓ ∈ ℝ � is the LLM’s logit output for the given prompt. Assuming that the logit difference between any two tokens is never greater than � max , these top- � biased probabilities will be � 1 ′ , � 2 ′ , … , � � ′ . For each of these biased probabilites � � ′ , we can solve for the unbiased probability as � � = � � ′ exp ⁡ � max − exp ⁡ � max ⁢ ∑ � = 1 � � � ′ + ∑ � = 1 � � � ′ (2) (proof in the Appendix A.1). Thus, for each API call, we can obtain the unbiased probability of � tokens, and obtain the full distribution in � / � API calls. 3.2Numerically stable full outputs from APIs In practice, the algorithm described in Section 3.1 suffers from severe numerical instability, which can be attributed to the fast-growing exponential term exp ⁡ � max , and the term ∑ � = 1 � � � ′ which quickly approaches 1. We can eliminate the instability by sacrificing some speed and using a different strategy to solve for the unbiased probabilities. Without loss of generality, let � � be the maximum unbiased token probability. This can be obtained by querying the API once with no bias. If we then query the API and apply maximum bias to only tokens 1 , 2 , … , 1 − � , then the API will yield � 1 ′ , � 2 ′ , … , � � − 1 ′ and � � ′ . We can then solve for the unbiased probabilities of the � − 1 tokens � � = exp ⁡ ( log ⁡ � � ′ − � max − log ⁡ � � ′ + log ⁡ � � ) (3) (proof in Appendix A.2). By finding � − 1 unbiased token probabilities with every API call, we obtain the full output in � / ( � − 1 ) calls total. 3.3Full outputs from stochastic APIs Each of the above algorithms assume that the API is deterministic, i.e., the same query will always return the same output. This is not always the case. For instance, we find that OpenAI’s LLM APIs are stochastic. While this would seem to doom any attempt at obtaining full outputs from the LLM, we find that certain types of stochasticity can be dealt with. In particular, we model OpenAI’s stochastic behavior as a collection of � outputs 𝒑 ( 1 ) , 𝒑 ( 2 ) , … , 𝒑 ( � ) from which the API randomly returns from. This might be the result of multiple instances of the LLM being run on different hardware which results in slightly different outputs. Whichever instance the API returns from determines which of the � outputs we get. In order to determine which of the outputs the API returned from, assume without loss of generality that � � − 1 ( � ) is the second highest token probability for all � , and observe that log ⁡ � � ( � ) − log ⁡ � � − 1 ( � ) = log ⁡ � � ′ ⁣ ( � ) − log ⁡ � � − 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) (4) for all outputs 𝒑 ( � ) and unbiased outputs 𝒑 ′ ⁣ ( � ) where tokens � and � − 1 are not biased (proof in Appendix A.3). Therefore, by biasing only � − 2 tokens for each call, the API will return � 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) , � 2 ′ ⁣ ( � ) , … , � � − 2 ′ ⁣ ( � ) as well as � � ′ ⁣ ( � ) and � � − 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) for some � , and we can determine which output 𝒑 ( � ) the result comes from by using log ⁡ � � ′ ⁣ ( � ) − log ⁡ � � − 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) as an identifier. Thus, after an average of � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) calls to the API we can collect the full set of probabilities for one of the outputs. 3.4Ultra-fast full outputs using the LLM image So far, the dominating factor in each algorithm’s runtime is � . We now introduce a preprocessing step that takes advantage of the low-dimensional LLM output space to obtain � ⁢ ( � ) versions of all the above algorithms. Since � ≪ � for many modern language models, this modification can result in multiple orders of magnitude speedups, depending on the LLM. For instance, the speedup for an LLM like pythia-70m would be 100 × . The key to this algorithm is the observation from Section 2 that � linearly independent outputs from the API constitute a basis for the whole output space (since the LLM’s image has dimension � ). We can therefore collect these outputs 𝑷 = [ 𝒑 1 𝒑 2 ⋯ 𝒑 � ] ∈ Δ � � as a preprocessing step in � ⁢ ( � ⁢ � ) API calls using any of the above algorithms and � unique prompts, and then use these to reconstruct the full LLM output after only � ⁢ ( � ) queries for each subsequent output. To get a new full output 𝒑 , use any of the above algorithms to obtain � 1 , � 2 , … , � � . Next, we will use the additive log ratio ( alr ) transform, which an isomorphism Δ � → ℝ � − 1 and is defined as alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) = ( log ⁡ � 2 � 1 , log ⁡ � 3 � 1 , … , log ⁡ � � � 1 ) to transform the columns of 𝑷 and 𝒑 into vectors in ℝ � − 1 , though since we only know the first � values of 𝒑 , we can only obtain the first � values of alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) . Because the alr transform is an isomorphism, we have that the columns of alr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) = [ alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 1 ) alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 2 ) ⋯ alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 1 ) ] ∈ ℝ ( � − 1 ) × � form a basis for a � -dimensional vector subspace of ℝ � − 1 , and alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) lies within this subspace. Therefore, there is some 𝒙 ∈ ℝ � such that alr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 = alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) . To solve for 𝒙 , all that is required is to find the unique solution to the first � rows of this system of linear equations [ alr ( � 1 ) 1 alr ( � 2 ) 1 ⋯ alr ( � � ) 1 alr ( � 1 ) 2 alr ( � 2 ) 2 ⋯ alr ( � � ) 2 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ alr ( � 1 ) � alr ( � 2 ) � ⋯ alr ( � � ) � ] ⁢ [ � 1 � 2 ⋮ � � ] = [ alr ( � ) 1 alr ( � ) 2 ⋮ alr ( � ) � ] . (5) After finding 𝒙 , we can reconstruct the full LLM output 𝒑 = alr − 1 ⁡ ( alr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 ) , where the inverse alr function is defined as alr − 1 ⁡ ( 𝒙 ) = 1 1 + ∑ � = 1 � − 1 exp ⁡ � � ⋅ ( 1 , exp ⁡ � 1 , exp ⁡ � 2 , … , exp ⁡ � � − 1 ) . Thus we can retrieve 𝒑 in only � ⁢ ( � ) API queries. This ( � / � ) × speedup makes any method that relies on full model outputs significantly cheaper. This includes model stealing (Tramèr et al., 2016) which attempts to learn a model that exactly replicates the behavior of a target model. 4Discovering the embedding size of API-protected LLMs Without knowing the exact architectural details, other than assuming the generic output layer described in Figure 2, it is possible to infer the embedding size � of an API-protected language model from its outputs alone. This is a direct result of the fact that the model outputs occupy a � -dimensional subspace of Δ � , and therefore collecting � linearly independent outputs 𝒑 1 , 𝒑 2 , … , 𝒑 � ∈ Δ � from the LLM will form a basis for the LLM’s image, meaning that all subsequent model outputs 𝒑 � + 1 will be a linear combination of the first � outputs. Assuming that model outputs are full rank, i.e., all collections of � prompts are linearly independent, and all collections of � + 1 prompts are linearly dependent, we can discover the value of � by collecting outputs one at a time until the number of linearly independent outputs in the collection stops increasing, which will occur when we have collected � + 1 prompts. In practice, we find that this full-rank assumption tends to hold well enough when over-collecting outputs, e.g., collecting � + 1000 outputs. To find the dimension of a space spanned by model outputs, we use the fact that a matrix with � linearly independent columns will have � non-zero singular values. We can therefore plot the singular values of the matrix 𝑳 = clr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) = [ clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 1 ) clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 2 ) ⋯ clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 � ) ] and observe the index at which the magnitude of the singular values drops to zero, which will occur at index � .2 In practice, due to precision issues, the magnitudes may not drop all the way to zero. Refer to caption Figure 4: The singular values of outputs from LLMs with various known and unknown embedding sizes � . For each model with known embedding size, there is a clear drop in magnitude at singular value index � , indicating the embedding size of the model. Using this observation, we can guess the embedding size of gpt-3.5-turbo. To validate our method, we collect next-token distributions (conditioned on unique, 1-token prompts) from several open-source LLMs from the Pythia family (Biderman et al., 2023) with embedding sizes ranging from 512 to 1024. For all these models, we find that the singular values of the resulting output matrix drop dramatically precisely at the index corresponding to the embedding size of the model, as shown in the first three plots of Figure 2. To demonstrate our method’s effectiveness against API-protected LLMs, we use our stochastically robust � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) algorithm to collect nearly 6,000 next-token distribution outputs from gpt-3.5-turbo3, a popular API-protected LLM whose embedding size is not publicly disclosed. We find that the singular values for these outputs drop dramatically between index 4,600 and 4,650, indicating that the embedding size of this model is at most this size. This predicted embedding size is somewhat abnormal, since LLM embedding sizes are traditionally set to powers of two (or sums of powers of two). If this were the case for gpt-3.5-turbo, it would be reasonable to guess that the embedding size is 2 12 = 4096 or 2 12 + 2 9 = 4608 , the former of which we think is most likely. We predict that our raw estimate of 4,600-4,650 is an overestimate of the true embedding size, since any abnormal outputs due to errors (whether in our own code or OpenAI’s) would only increase the dimensionality of the observed output space. In particular, if we inadvertently collected 504 corrupted outputs, then a model with embedding size 4,096 would appear to have an embedding size of 4,600. Extrapolating further, assuming that gpt-3.5-turbo has a similar architecture to most transformer-based LLMs, it is likely that the number of parameters in gpt-3.5-turbo is around 7 billion. This estimation is based on the fact that most known transformer-based LLMs with embedding size 4,096 have ≈ 7 billion parameters. Any other parameter count would result in either abnormally narrow or wide neural networks which are not known to have favorable performance. An important exception to this rule-of-thumb, however, would be the increasingly popular “mixture-of-experts” architecture which tends to have many more parameters per embedding dimension. Previous estimates of gpt-3.5-turbo’s parameter count based on hearsay have generally exceeded 7B (Singh et al., 2023), however given the periodically updating versions and decreasing cost of inference with this model, it is possible that its size and architecture has changed over time. Fortunately, our method can be used to monitor these updates over time, alerting end-users when LLM providers make architectural changes to their model, specifically updates to the embedding size and/or parameter count. 5Identifying LLMs from a single output Refer to caption Figure 5: Residuals of the least-squares solution of 𝑾 ⁢ 𝒙 = ℓ for an output ℓ from a pythia-70m checkpoint (training step 120K), and softmax matrices 𝑾 at various training steps for pythia-70m, and pythia-70m-deduped, and pythia-160m. Low/high residual values indicate that the output ℓ is/is not in a model’s image. Residuals for pythia-70m decrease as the checkpoints near the checkpoint that generated the output, but remain high. Note that this test works even if the softmax matrices 𝑾 are substituted with model outputs 𝑳 . The image of two different LLMs, even different checkpoints from the same LLM, are largely disjoint. As shown in Figure 5, the logit output from a late-training checkpoint of Pythia-70M lies uniquely in the image of the checkpoint, and not in the image of the preceding or following checkpoints. We also verify that the output does not lie in the image of any checkpoints from a similar LLM trained on deduplicated data, nor any checkpoint from a larger LLM trained on the same data. This suggests that the image of a LLM is highly sensitive to small parameter changes. Intuitively this makes sense, since the output of one model will only be in the image of another model in the extremely unlikely event that it happens to lie on the low-dimensional ( < � ) intersection of the models’ images. Mathematically the dimension of the models’ images’ intersection is small since the intersection � ∩ � of two subspaces � and � that are not subsets of one another has dimension dim � + dim � − dim ( � ∪ � ) , which implies that dim ( � ∩ � ) < min ⁡ { dim � , dim � } (since dim ( � ∪ � ) > max ⁡ { dim � , dim � } ). Thus, it is possible to determine precisely which LLM produced a particular output, using only API access to a set of LLMs and without knowing the exact inputs to the model. In this way, the model’s image acts as a signature for the model, i.e., a unique model identifier. This finding has implications for LLM provider accountability. For instance, if provider � suspects provider � of stealing their proprietary model, provider � could check provider � ’s model signature to see if it matches their own. It would be extremely unlikely that the signatures match if the LLMs are not the same. Similarly, if a provider claimed to be serving a proprietary model while in actuality attempting to profit off of an open-source model with a non-commercial license, an auditor again could discover this by checking the LLM signature. This test is somewhat one-sided, however, since a clever provider may do a small amount of additional fine-tuning to change their stolen LLM’s image. 5.1Detecting and disambiguating LLM updates Another practical application of highly sensitive LLM images is to detect and distinguish minor and major model updates to API-protected LLMs. Using the above test, we can tell whether or not the LLM image remains the same, even if the logit outputs change. This phenomenon would correspond to a partial model update, where some part of the model changes, but the softmax matrix remains the same. An example of this would be if the LLM has a hidden prefix added to all prompts and this hidden prefix changes: the model’s outputs will change but the image will remain the same. Table 3 gives an overview for how to interpret various combinations of detectable API changes, This information is useful for monitoring unannounced changes in API LLMs. Table 3:Implications of image/logit changes. Change Interpretation No logit change, no image change No update Logit change, no image change Hidden prompt change or partial finetune with frozen output layer Low-rank image change (See § 5.2) LoRA update Image change Full finetune 5.2Detecting LoRA updates We speculate that it is possible to gain even higher granularity information on LLM updates of certain types, such as LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) updates. LoRA is a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method which adjusts model weights with a low-rank update 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 where 𝑨 ∈ ℝ � × � and 𝑩 ∈ ℝ � × � so that the softmax matrix 𝑾 ∈ ℝ � × � becomes 𝑾 + 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 . We speculate that it is possible to detect these types of updates by collecting LLM outputs before ( 𝑳 ∈ ℝ � × � ) and after ( 𝑳 ′ ∈ ℝ � × � ) the update and decomposing them as 𝑾 ⁢ 𝑯 = 𝑳 and ( 𝑾 + 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 ) ⁢ 𝑯 = 𝑳 ′ where 𝑯 , 𝑯 ′ ∈ ℝ � × � such that im ⁡ ( 𝑾 ⁢ 𝑯 ) = im ⁡ ( 𝑾 + 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 ) . If such a decomposition is found, then it appears likely that the weights received a low-rank update of rank � . We leave it to future work to determine whether finding such a decomposition is sufficient to conclude that a LoRA update took place, as well as to find an efficient algorithm for finding such a decomposition. 6More applications Access to the LLM’s image can lead to many other capabilities, some of which we discuss below. We leave further investigation of these methods for future work. 6.1Finding unargmaxable tokens Due to the low-rank constraints on LLM outputs, it is possible that some tokens become unargmaxable (Demeter et al., 2020; Grivas et al., 2022), i.e., there is a token � such that the constraints disallow any output 𝒑 with arg ⁡ max � ⁡ � � = � . This happens when the LLM’s embedding representation of � lies within the convex hull of the other tokens’ embeddings. Previously, finding unargmaxable tokens appeared to require full access to the softmax matrix 𝑾 . Interestingly, we find that it is possible to identify unargmaxable tokens using only the LLM’s image, which our method is able to recover. This technique allows API customers to find quirks in LLM behavior such as tokens that the model is unable to output (at least under greedy decoding). 6.2Recovering the softmax matrix from outputs Since our method gives us access to the image of the output layer, and not the output layer parameters, we investigate the how one might reconstruct the output later parameters, either exactly or approximately. We hypothesize that LLM embeddings generally lie near the surface of a hypersphere in ℝ � with a small radius � . We see evidence of this in the fact that the Pythia LLM embedding norms are all small and roughly normally distributed, as shown in Figure 6. Refer to caption Figure 6:Softmax matrix row magnitudes (here from pythia-70m) are small and are distributed approximately normally within a narrow range. Assuming this holds for any LLM, we can attempt to recover 𝑾 up to a rotation by simplifying the assumption into a constraint that all embeddings must have a magnitude of 1. Then, given a matrix 𝑳 ∈ ℝ � × � of model logits, we can find 𝑾 (up to a rotation) by finding a decomposition 𝑾 ⁢ 𝑯 = 𝑳 such that for all � , ∥ � � ∥ 2 = � . This solution may also be approximated by finding the singular value decomposition 𝑾 ⁢ 𝚺 ⁢ 𝑽 ⊤ of 𝑳 , though it is likely that all rows of this 𝑾 will have magnitude less than 1 and they are not guaranteed to be normally distributed. 6.3Improved LLM inversion Morris et al.’s (2023) recent approach to recovering hidden prompts (i.e., an additional prefix added to LLM input, not shown to the user) uses full LLM API outputs to train an “inversion” model that generates the prefix conditioned on the LLM’s full logprob vector log ⁡ 𝒑 . In addition to our algorithm from Section 3.4 making this much cheaper to implement, we also propose a methodological change to their procedure. In particular, to deal with the size mismatch between the LLM’s vocabulary size � and the inversion model’s embedding size � inv , Morris et al. (2023) pad and reshape the vector into a ⌈ � / � inv ⌉ -length sequence of embeddings in ℝ � inv . This transformation is somewhat unnatural, and requires that the inversion model only be conditioned on a single output. We propose instead to take advantage of our knowledge of the LLM’s image to obtain a linearly lossless representation of the LLM output in ℝ � , which is much closer to the inversion model size, then use an MLP to project this representation onto ℝ � inv to feed into the inversion model. Formally, after obtaining 𝑷 and 𝒑 from the API, we use the unique solution 𝒙 to clr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 = clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) as the input to the inversion model. This modification has an additional advantage: instead of conditioning on a single output 𝒑 , the LLM can be used to generate a short sequence of outputs 𝒑 1 , 𝒑 2 , … , 𝒑 � which can be fed into the inversion model as 𝒙 1 , 𝒙 2 , … , 𝒙 � where clr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 � = clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 � ) . We leave the implementation and evaluation of this proposed modification for future work. This technique can be applied generally to any method that takes LLM outputs as input. 6.4Basis-aware sampling In a recent paper, Finlayson et al. (2023) propose a decoding algorithm that avoids type-I sampling errors by identifying tokens that must have non-zero true probability. Importantly, this method relies on knowing the basis of the LLM’s output space, and is therefore only available for LLMs whose image is known. Our proposed approach for finding the image of API-protected LLMs makes this decoding algorithm possible for API LLMs. 7Mitigations We consider a three proposals that LLM providers may take to guard against our methods. The first proposal is to remove API access to logprobs. This, however is theoretically insufficient, as Morris et al. (2023) show that it is possible to obtain full outputs using only information about the biased argmax token, albeit inefficiently in � ⁢ log ⁡ � API calls. Regardless of the theoretical result, providers may rely on the extreme inefficiency of the algorithm to protect the LLM. This appears to be the approach OpenAI took after learning about this vulnerability from Carlini et al. (2024), by always returning the top- � unbiased logprobs. Our new proposed algorithm, however, brings the number of queries down to a more feasible � ⁢ log ⁡ � API calls once the initial work of finding the LLM image has finished, weakening the argument that the expensiveness of the algorithm is sufficient to disregard our technique. The next proposal is to remove API access to logit bias. This would be an effective way to protect the LLM, since there are no known methods to recover full outputs from such an API. However, the logit bias interface is presumably useful for many clients who might be disappointed by its shutdown. Lastly, we consider alternative LLM architectures that do not suffer from a softmax bottleneck. There are several such proposed architectures with good performance. Though this is the most expensive of the proposed defenses, due to the requirement of training a new LLM, it would have the beneficial side effect of also treating other tokenization issues that plague large-vocabulary LLMs (e.g., Itzhak and Levy, 2022). A transition to softmax-bottleneck-free LLMs would fully prevent our attack, since the model’s image would be the full output space. 8Discussion Overall, the potential applications of our methods can have great impact in building trust between the LLM API users and the providers; at the same time, none are particularly harmful to LLM providers. For instance, consider discovering the embedding size of the LLM, which is often non-public information in proprietary LLMs. However, access to this hyperparameter does not enable a competitor to fully recover the parameters of the LLM’s softmax matrix or boost performance of their own model; several other factors such as training data mix, human feedback and several other engineering choices are still critical and hidden. Even using model outputs to steal hidden prompts (see Section 6.3) is unlikely to have detrimental effects, as hidden prompt leakage is a known vulnerability and best practice dictates that no private information should be contained in these system prompts (Greshake et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). We find that the most dangerous consequence of our findings might simply be that model stealing methods that rely on full outputs get cheaper by a factor of � / � , which in the case of gpt-3.5-turbo amounts to about 25 × . On the other hand, allowing LLM API users to detect model changes builds trust between LLM providers and their customers, and leads to greater accountability and transparency for the providers. Our method can be used to implement efficient protocols for model auditing without exposing the model parameters or detailed configuration information, which may help model safety and privacy protection of personalized, proprietary models. We therefore take the position that our proposed methods and findings do not necessitate a change in LLM API best practices, but rather expand the tools available to API customers, while warning LLM providers of the information their APIs expose. 9Simultaneous discovery In a remarkable case of simultaneous discovery, Carlini et al. (2024) propose a very similar approach to ours for gaining insight into API-protected LLMs. Here we review a some interesting interactions between our work and theirs. First, we give an algorithm for obtaining full outputs in � / � API calls, while their algorithm corresponds to our � / ( � − 1 ) algorithm. This has little impact on our final result, since our � / � algorithm suffers from numerical instability, but it is an interesting theoretical result nonetheless. On the flip side, Carlini et al. propose an improved logprob-free method for getting full outputs from an API that takes advantage of parallel queries. This useful method is actually complementary to our � ⁢ ( � ) algorithm, since they can be combined to yield an even better algorithm for obtaining full outputs. Next, our experiments with OpenAI’s API were fraught with issues of stochasticity: the API would return different results for the same query, leading us to develop the stochastically robust full output algorithm. Meanwhile, our colleagues did not appear to encounter such issues, perhaps because they had access to a more stable API endpoint than ours. Lastly, Carlini et al. focus mostly on defenses and mitigations against attacks, while our own work focuses more on understanding the capabilities such attacks provide once an LLM image has been obtained. These approaches complement each other, since our work provides additional motivation for why (or why not) such defenses should be implemented. 10Conclusion In this paper we have laid out the fundamentals of how the softmax bottleneck imposes the low-rank constraints on LLM outputs, and shown how these constraints expose non-public information about API-protected LLMs. We have explained how this information, i.e., the LLM’s image, lends itself to a model signature, which has myriad uses—exposing model hyperparameters, recovering the output layer parameters, detecting specific types of model updates, and efficiently obtaining full outputs from the model, among others. We find that current protections against these attacks may be insufficient, and that the more effective guards we consider either eliminate sanctioned API use cases (i.e., logit bias), or are expensive to implement (i.e., changing model architecture). Lastly, we argue that this “vulnerability” may be more of a feature than a bug; since we believe that the benefits for API clients outweigh any known harms to LLM providers.\\"\\"","completion":"Alright, let me break down this very tech-heavy document into simpler terms. Imagine you have a super smart robot that can talk and write beautifully. This robot is very expensive and unique, so the company that made it doesn't want to just give it away. Instead, they let people talk to the robot through a special phone line (this is what we call an API). However, they're careful not to reveal how the robot actually creates its sentences, because that's their secret recipe. Now, some smart researchers have found a way to figure out some of the secret ingredients of the robot's recipe, just by talking to it through this phone line. They discovered that, even though the company tried to keep the recipe a secret, the way the robot speaks and writes has certain patterns. By carefully analyzing these patterns, the researchers could make educated guesses about parts of the secret recipe. Here's how they did it: 1. **Figuring out the robot's thought size**: One of the things they were able to guess is how big the robot's \\"brain\\" is. Imagine the robot's brain is made of boxes, and each box can hold a piece of information. The researchers found a way to count how many boxes there are, just by listening to the robot talk. 2. **Getting the robot to reveal more than it should**: Normally, the robot only shares a little bit at a time, but the researchers figured out how to make it reveal a full thought all at once. This is like getting the robot to spill all the beans about what it's thinking, rather than just a bean or two. 3. **Recognizing the robot's handwriting**: By looking at the specific way the robot writes, the researchers can tell which company's robot wrote something, even if multiple companies claim it was theirs. It's like recognizing someone's handwriting. 4. **Spotting updates in the robot**: They also found a way to tell when the company had tried to upgrade the robot or change its thinking process slightly. It's like noticing that your friend got a new haircut or changed their style. The cool thing is, the researchers argue that being able to do this isn't necessarily bad. Instead, it can make the companies more honest about what they're doing with their robots and ensure they're not claiming to have invented something they didn't. In conclusion, this document is a very detailed explanation of these researchers finding loopholes in the way companies try to keep their robot recipes secret. And they suggest that maybe these companies shouldn't worry too much about these loopholes but instead see them as a way to show how open and honest they can be with their users."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Elle s'appuie sur différents types d'encres, chacun ayant ses propres avantages et applications spécifiques. Voici les principaux types d'encres utilisés dans l'impression numérique grand format : 1. **Encres à solvant :** Ces encres pénètrent dans la surface du support d’impression et sèchent rapidement, ce qui les rend résistantes à l'eau et aux UV. Elles sont idéales pour les applications extérieures comme les bannières, les enseignes et les graphiques de véhicules. Les inconvénients incluent la nécessité de ventilation à cause des composés organiques volatils (COV) qu'elles émettent. 2. **Encres éco-solvants :** Moins agressives que les encres à solvant, les encres éco-solvants émettent moins de COV et sont considérées comme plus respectueuses de l'environnement. Elles offrent une bonne durabilité en extérieur et sont adaptées à une large gamme de supports. 3. **Encres latex :** Composées principalement d'eau et de latex, ces encres sont plus écologiques et ne nécessitent généralement pas de ventilation spéciale. Elles offrent une excellente qualité d'impression, une grande flexibilité et sont compatibles avec une variété de supports, y compris des papiers non traités. Les encres latex sèchent rapidement et sont durables à l'extérieur. 4. **Encres UV (ultraviolet) :** Ces encres séchent instantanément lorsqu'elles sont exposées à la lumière UV, permettant des impressions sur une grande variété de supports, y compris des matériaux non absorbants comme le métal, le verre, ou le plastique. Les impressions sont résistantes aux rayons UV, à l'eau, et ne nécessitent pas de lamination pour les applications extérieures. Toutefois, l'équipement nécessaire pour l'impression UV peut être coûteux. 5. **Encres à sublimation de teinture :** Ces encres passent de l’état solide à l’état gazeux sous l’effet de la chaleur et pénètrent dans le support d'impression, créant ainsi une image très durable. Elles sont idéales pour les tissus et offrent d'excellentes propriétés de lavage et de résistance à la lumière. La sublimation de teinture est souvent utilisée pour des drapeaux, des banderoles, des backdrops pour stands d'exposition et des vêtements. 6. **Encres aqueuses :** Ces encres, basées sur l'eau, sont principalement utilisées pour les impressions de haute qualité, comme les affiches, les reproductions d'art et les photographies. Elles nécessitent des supports d'impression spéciaux et sont moins durables à l'extérieur, même si l'usage de laminations peut en prolonger la durée de vie. Chaque type d'encre a ses propres spécificités et le choix de l'encre dépendra du produit fini désiré et de son application.

The central region's significance contributed to the spread and influence of the Tagalog language. 2. **Political and Economic Centrality**: Manila, located in a Tagalog-speaking region, has always been the political and economic heart of the country. Administrative decisions, educational policies, and economic activities largely conducted in and around this area naturally elevated the status of Tagalog. 3. **American Colonial Education Policy**: During the American colonization in the early 20th century, there was an attempt to establish a national language to foster unity and identity among the diverse ethno-linguistic groups in the archipelago. Tagalog's prominence in the region around Manila, which was the colonizers' administrative and educational hub, played a role in its selection. 4. **National Language Institute Selection**: In 1937, the National Language Institute selected Tagalog as the basis of the national language (originally called \\"Pilipino\\") for its supposedly indigenous nature, widespread use, and rich literary tradition. This decision, although controversial among speakers of other languages, was pivotal in establishing Tagalog's national relevance. 5. **Cultural Influence and Media**: Tagalog has a rich literary and cultural history. Over the years, Tagalog-based media (films, television, and publications) from the Metro Manila area have dominated the cultural landscape of the Philippines, further entrenching its status as the de facto lingua franca. 6. **Filipino Language Development**: The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines designated Filipino as the national language, which was intended to be a 'developed' version of Tagalog. Filipino was conceived to incorporate words from other Philippine languages as well as from Spanish, English, and other languages, reflecting the country's diverse cultural and linguistic heritage. However, Filipino remains largely based on Tagalog, and the terms \\"Filipino\\" and \\"Tagalog\\" are often used interchangeably in casual context, though formally they are distinct, with Filipino aiming to be more inclusive of the linguistic diversity of the Philippines. 7. **Education and Official Use**: The educational system of the Philippines uses both Filipino and English as languages of instruction, further securing the role of Tagalog-based Filipino as a national unifier. Government and official documents are often in Filipino alongside English, reinforcing its status as an essential component of national identity and communication. Despite the predominance of Tagalog/Filipino, it's important to note that the Philippines is home to a rich tapestry of languages, with over 170 languages spoken across the archipelago. While Tagalog/Filipino serves as a unifying language, efforts continue to preserve and honor the country's linguistic diversity."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Using the Playwright framework, the process involves interacting with page locators and potentially using Playwright’s \`waitForSelector\` function or other waiting mechanisms. Below is a structured approach in Playwright (assuming you're using JavaScript or TypeScript). \`\`\`javascript // Assuming 'page' is your page object // First, click on the dropdown to show options await page.locator(\\"#s2id_EmaratechSG_Theme_wt789_block_wtFormContent_SmartChannels_Application_CW_wt437_block_WebPatterns_wtcntAppSimpleSecExpandable_block_wtContent_wtContent_wtcmbApplicantFaith\\").click(); // Wait for the dropdown options to appear // This step might require adjusting the selector to uniquely identify the dropdown or its options if they are dynamically loaded. // I am guessing the structure based on the provided detail; // You may need to adjust the 'waitForSelector' or use another waiting mechanism that fits your actual DOM structure. await page.waitForSelector(\\"text=UnKnown\\"); // After confirming the \\"UnKnown\\" option is present, click on it await page.locator(\\"li\\").filter({hasText: \\"UnKnown\\"}).click(); \`\`\` Make sure to adjust the selectors if they are not unique enough to select the specific elements you're interacting with. When working with dynamically loaded content (like a dropdown populated via AJAX or similar), it's critical to ensure the elements are indeed present and interactable before attempting to click or interact with them. Playwright provides a variety of waiting functions such as \`page.waitForSelector()\`, \`locator.waitFor()\`, etc., to handle such scenarios effectively. In your initial question, you mentioned you'd like to check if an option has loaded and then interact with it. The approach above assumes that by waiting for the text \\"UnKnown\\" to appear, you're indirectly checking for it to load before attempting the click. This is a common pattern for dealing with dynamic content in web automation."},{"prompt":"Je veux tu réorganises ce code tailwind en entier en gardant les formcontrolname : <form class=\\"vehicle-form

So i calculate the node features and adjacency matrix from my graph to feed the data into the GNN model, Here I am having doubt that, in what way of the node feature representation in tensor will be more suitable for the GNN model (Direct node features from circuit graph, or the node feature in one hot representation)","completion":"Choosing the right representation for node features when feeding them into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model depends on several factors, including the nature of your data, the type of GNN model you're using, and the specific task you're aiming to accomplish (e.g., node classification, graph classification, link prediction). Here are key considerations for each representation: # 1. Direct Node Features from Circuit Graph **Pros:** - **Rich Information:** Direct features can capture a wide range of continuous variables (e.g., 'w_value', 'l_value') directly related to the physical properties of the circuit components. This can provide the GNN model with rich, detailed information about each node. - **Minimal Preprocessing:** Requires less preprocessing and can keep the original information without loss due to encoding. **Cons:** - **Normalization Required:** These features often require careful normalization to ensure that they are on the same scale. Without normalization, features with larger numerical ranges might dominate the learning process, leading the model to perform poorly. - **Sparse Features:** In some cases, not all nodes will have non-zero values for all features, leading to sparse feature vectors that might be less efficient to learn from. # 2. Node Features in One-Hot Representation **Pros:** - **Homogeneity:** One-hot encoding makes feature vectors of the same length and scale, which can simplify model training. - **Categorical Data Handling:** It's effective for representing categorical data or explicit presence/absence of features, making it suitable for types of nodes or the presence of specific attributes. **Cons:** - **Loss of Information:** One-hot encoding can result in a loss of information, especially for continuous features like physical dimensions or electrical properties. These continuous variables are reduced to binary presence/absence indicators. - **Dimensionality:** The dimensionality of the input features can significantly increase with one-hot encoding, especially if there are many categories. This can lead to a sparser matrix and might increase the computational complexity. # Hybrid Approach Often, a hybrid approach can be advantageous, where you: - Use direct features for continuous variables that convey essential information about the circuit components (like 'w_value', 'l_value') with appropriate normalization. - Employ one-hot encoding for categorical variables (like types of components or specific categorical attributes). # Practical Considerations for GNNs - **Task Relevance:** Ensure the features you select are relevant to the task. For example, if you're predicting electrical properties, the physical properties of components might be more relevant than their categorical types. - **Graph Structure:** In addition to node features, GNNs also learn from the graph structure itself. Sometimes, even simple features can lead to high performance if the graph topology is informative for the task at hand. - **Model Capacity:** More complex feature representations can require more sophisticated models with higher capacity to learn effectively from them. # Conclusion A hybrid approach, carefully combining direct features for capturing the rich, continuous nature of certain attributes and one-hot encoding for categorical data, can often provide a balanced solution. Experimentation is key: try different representations and evaluate them based on your specific tasks and goals. It's also beneficial to consider feature engineering and selection as an iterative process, where initial results guide further refinement."},{"prompt":"for transistor i am having W and L values, for passives i am having Value. How can i represent each node (value1, value2) if the node is transistor then it is (W, L) if the node is passive then (R,0) or (W value, L value, passive value) if the node is transistor (W, L, 0) if the node is passive (0, 0, R).","completion":"Representing each node with a tuple of values (value1, value2, value3) to accommodate for transistors and passive components in a graph for feeding into a GNN can be achieved by conditionally setting these values based on the \`device_type\` and/or \`vertex_type\` in a uniform way across your dataset. This approach allows for a structured and informative input to the model that can make sense of different device characteristics within the same framework. Here's how you can modify the feature construction, considering your specifications: - **Transistors**: For nodes representing transistors, the feature vector should include the width (W) and length (L) of the transistor, and a third value set to 0 to indicate that there is no passive component value. - **Passives**: For nodes representing passive components (e.g., resistors, capacitors), the feature vector should have its first two elements set to 0 to indicate the absence of transistor W and L values, while the third value represents the passive component value (e.g., resistance R for resistors, capacitance C for capacitors). Here's how you can implement this logic: \`\`\`python import torch def get_node_features_with_values_mod(G): node_features = [] for node, data in G.nodes(data=True): # Initialize feature values w_value = 0 l_value = 0 passive_value = 0 # Check the device type and assign values accordingly if data.get('device_type') == 'transistor': w_value = data.get('w_value', 0) l_value = data.get('l_value', 0) elif data.get('device_type') == 'passive': passive_value = data.get('value', 0) # Construct the feature vector feature_vector = [w_value, l_value, passive_value] node_features.append(feature_vector) # Convert to Tensor node_features_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(node_features) return node_features_tensor # Assuming G is your graph # Example usage node_features_tensor = get_node_features_with_values_mod(G) \`\`\` This function processes each node in your graph \`G\`, determining whether it's a transistor or a passive component and sets the feature values accordingly. For transistors, it assigns the width (\`w_value\`) and length (\`l_value\`) values, and for passive components, it assigns the corresponding value to \`passive_value\`, encapsulating the essence of each component type comprehensively. This structured representation enables your GNN model to seamlessly differentiate between transistors and passive components based on their distinct electrical properties, enhancing its ability to learn from and make predictions about your circuit's topology and behavior."},{"prompt":"here do i need to normalize the values before fed it into the GNN or not","completion":"Yes, normalizing the values before feeding them into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is often crucial for several reasons: # 1. **Scale Differences**: Transistor sizes (W, L) and passive components' values (e.g., resistance, capacitance) may vary across several orders of magnitude. Without normalization, these scale differences can lead to instability in training because large values may dominate gradient updates, causing small values to have little to no impact. # 2. **Learning Efficiency**: Normalized input data can help the learning algorithm converge faster. When feature values are on a similar scale, gradient descent can more smoothly and quickly find the minimum of the loss function. # 3. **Numerical Stability**: Machine learning algorithms, including GNNs, can suffer from numerical instability due to very large or very small values. Normalization helps mitigate this by keeping feature values within a practical numerical range. # Ways to Normalize: - **Min-Max Normalization**: Scales all numeric variables into the range [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. [ X_{text{norm}} = frac{X - X_{text{min}}}{X_{text{max}} - X_{text{min}}} ] - **Z-Score Normalization (Standardization)**: Transforms the features to have mean (μ) = 0 and standard deviation (σ) = 1. [ X_{text{std}} = frac{X - mu}{sigma} ] - **Robust Scaling**: Similar to Z-score, but uses median and quartiles, therefore not influenced by outliers. [ X_{text{robust}} = frac{X - text{Median}}{text{Q3} - text{Q1}} ] # Implementation Tip: When you normalize your features, it’s important to remember that you should fit the normalization parameters (e.g., min and max, mean and standard deviation) only on the training dataset and then apply these fitted parameters to scale both the training and testing datasets. This approach prevents information leakage from the test set into the model training process. # Example of Normalization: Here's how a simple min-max normalization could be incorporated into the existing function that processes node features. This example assumes you already know the min and max values for each type of component value. In practice, you'd calculate these from your training data. \`\`\`python def normalize_feature(value, min_value, max_value): return (value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) if max_value > min_value else 0 # Example normalization inside the feature processing loop w_value_norm = normalize_feature(w_value, min_w, max_w) l_value_norm = normalize_feature(l_value, min_l, max_l) passive_value_norm = normalize_feature(passive_value, min_passive, max_passive) feature_vector = [w_value_norm, l_value_norm, passive_value_norm] \`\`\` In the scenario above, \`min_w\`, \`max_w\`, \`min_l\`, \`max_l\`, \`min_passive\`, and \`max_passive\` would be the respective minimum and maximum values for transistor widths, lengths, and passive values determined from your training data. Normalization is a preprocessing step that, while seemingly simple, requires careful consideration and implementation to ensure it effectively aids your model's learning process."},{"prompt":"My problem case is, my circuit topology is fixed (two stage opamp circuit) so the corresponding graph topology is also fixed.

For this what are the data's are must i need to give as input to the GNN model with RL algorithm. example like (node features, adjacency matrix, incident matrix, edge features. ets,.)","completion":"For optimizing circuit design variables in a fixed topology, such as a two-stage opamp circuit, to meet specific performance specifications using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL), your model should work on both high-quality representations of the circuit (structure and parameters) and have a clear objective or reward function tied to the performance specifications. Below are key elements that should be considered as inputs to the GNN model and the RL algorithm: # 1. **Node Features:** Node features are critical because they encapsulate the variable components of your circuit such as transistor dimensions (W, L for transistors), capacitance (C), resistance (R), bias voltage, and bias current. Each node in your graph corresponding to a component in your circuit must have features that represent its current state or value. - **For transistors**, features might include width (W), length (L), and possibly model parameters if different transistor models are being considered. - **For passive components** (resistors, capacitors), their resistance (R) or capacitance (C) values. - **For sources** (voltage or current sources), the magnitude, and possibly frequency if it's an AC source. # 2. **Adjacency Matrix:** The adjacency matrix represents the fixed topology of your circuit. It helps the GNN understand which components are connected to which, crucial for understanding the overall configuration of the opamp stages and how changes in one part may affect the rest. # 3. **Edge Features (optional):** While the adjacency matrix tells which nodes are connected, edge features can provide additional details about the connections, such as the type of connection, if there are multiple kinds of connections (e.g., gate-source, drain-source in transistors), or properties about the wires (like resistance, parasitic capacitance). # 4. **Incidence Matrix (optional):** The incidence matrix is another way of representing graph topology and can be particularly useful for certain types of analyses or GNN architectures that might leverage this form of representation. It might not be necessary depending on your GNN model choice but can be useful for more detailed electrical property calculations. # 5. **Objective / Reward Function:** In the context of RL, defining a clear and quantifiable reward function is essential. This function should evaluate how well a given set of design variables meets the target performance specifications. The reward could be based on factors such as: - Deviation from target gain, bandwidth, power consumption, etc. - Penalties for exceeding specified constraints like maximum power consumption or chip area. # 6. **Performance Specification Targets:** While not an input in the traditional sense, having a clear definition of your performance specification targets is crucial. This set of targets will inform the reward function and guide the RL agent in exploring the design space. # Input Preparation and Processing: 1. **Normalization:** Normalize node features to ensure that all values are on a similar scale, which aids model learning and convergence. 2. **Encoding:** If there are categorical features or discrete values (such as a type of transistor), consider one-hot encoding or embedding to represent these efficiently. 3. **Sequential Decisions:** Since you're using an RL algorithm, consider how the design variables can be adjusted in a sequence of actions to iteratively improve circuit performance toward the goal. # Putting It All Together: Your RL agent would iteratively propose adjustments to the circuit parameters (node features), and these adjustments would be encoded into your graph representation (with updated node features and possibly edge features). The GNN takes this graph as input to predict the resulting circuit performance or to provide insights for the RL agent to evaluate its actions. The reward function quantifies how well the modifications meet the specifications, guiding the RL algorithm in its exploration of the design space. This multi-input approach (combining structural and parametric data into a cohesive learning model) enables fine-grained optimization tasks within a defined architecture, aiming to fulfill complex, multi-dimensional performance targets."},{"prompt":"provide me the complete code structure for my requirement","completion":"Creating a complete code structure that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the task of optimizing circuit design requires several components.

GNNs operate on graph topology (how nodes are connected) and node/edge features; they do not intrinsically process the spatial positions of nodes unless explicitly designed to do so (e.g., Graph Neural Networks utilizing spatial relations as features). 2. **On Node/Edge Features & Adjacency Matrix:** The important aspects for GNNs are the nodes (and their features), edges (how nodes are connected), and possibly edge features – not the visual placement or layout of these nodes. If your node features, edge connections (adjacency matrix), and edge features remain consistent between runs, changing visual placements or the order of nodes in graphical representations doesn't influence the GNN's performance. What matters is that a node \\"A\\" connected to node \\"B\\" remains so across all representations and that their features are correctly represented. # When It Might Affect Performance: - **Feature Representation:** If the node positions are used as part of the feature input to your GNN model (e.g., in applications where spatial relationships are important like molecule structure analysis), then changes in these positions could indeed affect model performance. This doesn't seem to be your case if you're working with electronic circuit optimization. - **Consistency Between Runs:** For RL, especially when assessing the performance across different runs or episodes, ensuring a consistent graph representation (order of nodes in inputs, adjacency representations) may help with learning stability and reproducibility. Non-determinism in the representation could lead to slight variations in learning dynamics, though it should not fundamentally change the model's ability to learn. # Solving Representation Variability: To ensure consistency, especially if you're observing changes in representation that could impact the RL learning process, consider the following: - **Fixed Node Ordering:** When converting your netlist to a graph, ensure a consistent ordering of nodes and edges. This can often be achieved by sorting nodes and edges according to some criteria before processing. - **Adjacency Representation:** Ensure that the adjacency matrix (or list) representation is consistent across runs. This might mean using sorted lists of nodes to represent adjacency or ensuring the same ordering is used when the adjacency matrix is constructed. - **Deterministic Processing:** Ensure that all steps in processing your netlist to graph conversion, feature extraction, and any other preprocessing are deterministic. - **Verify Features:** Ensure that your node and edge feature extraction is consistent and does not inadvertently rely on the layout or order except where explicitly desired. # Summary: Visual or spatial node positions should not impact the performance of your GNN model as long as the graph's topological structure, node features, and adjacency representations are consistent across runs. Ensure deterministic processing and representation of your graph data when feeding it into the GNN for best reproducibility and learning efficiency."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

When you mention the positions of nodes changing, this raises a few points to consider in terms of computational models such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their use in Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments. **Impact on Performance:** 1. **Topology vs. Features**: If the topology (i.e., how the nodes are connected) of your circuit netlist represented as a graph remains fixed, and only the node features (e.g., electrical properties, resistances, capacitances) are being optimized or tuned, the changing positions of nodes should not inherently affect the performance of the GNN. This is because GNNs primarily rely on the topology and features of the graph rather than the absolute positions of nodes in a spatial layout. 2. **Feature Representation**: However, if the physical layout (i.e., the spatial arrangement of components) impacts the features of your nodes or edges (e.g., lengths of wires affecting resistance or capacitance), then a changing layout could influence the performance by changing the underlying data the GNN is working with. 3. **Stability and Generalization**: Frequent changes in the graph's representation (even if topologically invariant) could potentially impact the stability and generalization ability of your GNN model, especially in a reinforcement learning setting where consistency in the environment can be crucial for policy learning. **Addressing the Issue:** 1. **Graph Canonicalization**: Ensure that your graph representation is canonicalized or standardized in a way that different representations of the same graph map to the same representation. This process involves creating a normalized form of the graph so that isomorphic graphs have the same representation. 2. **Feature Augmentation**: Explicitly encode spatial or positional information as part of your node or edge features if the physical layout holds significance for your circuit's performance. This way, even if nodes move, their relative positions can be captured in the features, allowing the GNN to utilize this information. 3. **Graph Drawing Algorithms**: If the visual layout for human interpretation keeps changing and causing confusion, employing a stable graph drawing algorithm could help. Algorithms that aim for aesthetic criteria including minimizing edge crossings and maintaining node spacing could be used to generate more consistent layouts for visualization or analysis purposes. 4. **Graph Isomorphism Checks**: Implement checks to determine if variations in your graph's representation from run to run are actually different in terms of topology or just in terms of the layout. Tools and libraries that support graph isomorphism checks can be useful here. In summary, while changes in the spatial layout of nodes in your bipartite multigraph representation of a circuit might not directly impact the algorithmic performance of GNNs (assuming the topology and relevant features remain consistent), they could influence how features are derived and interpreted. Addressing this requires ensuring your model accurately captures the relevant aspects of your graph's structure and features, potentially by including positional information directly in your feature representations or ensuring a consistent graph representation across runs."},{"prompt":"https://puanbu.net/ bu sitede ki sıralama hesaplama formülü nedir","completion":"Üzgünüm, ancak ben gerçek zamanlı internete erişemiyorum veya belirli bir URL'yi ziyaret edemem.

Relying too heavily on AI could lead to poor judgment calls, potentially harming a brand's reputation. 6. **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**: The use of AI in CMS for personalizing content based on user behavior and preferences raises significant privacy concerns. There's a fine line between personalization and privacy invasion, and mishandling of data could lead to legal and ethical issues. 7. **Dependence on AI Providers**: Relying on third-party AI technologies could lead to dependency, where businesses might find it difficult to operate or innovate without the proprietary AI tools. This could also lead to increased operational costs if the AI services are monetized or if the pricing models change. 8. **Regulatory and Compliance Risks**: The legal landscape around AI and data usage is still evolving. Businesses utilizing AI in their CMS must navigate complex regulatory environments, ensuring compliance with data protection laws (like GDPR), intellectual property rights, and other relevant legislation. Non-compliance could lead to significant legal and financial repercussions. 9. **Algorithm Bias**: AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If this data contains biases, the AI could perpetuate or even exacerbate these biases in the content management process, leading to unfair or unethical outcomes. 10. **Content Overload**: AI's ability to generate content at scale might lead to an overwhelming amount of content, making it difficult for users to find value amidst the noise. This could dilute the impact of content strategies and lead to user disengagement. While AI presents promising opportunities for enhancing CMS capabilities, it's important for businesses to be mindful of these potential dangers. Addressing these concerns proactively through robust planning, ethical AI practices, and continuous monitoring can help mitigate risks and leverage AI technologies effectively within content management systems."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here’s how you could achieve this using Playwright with Python: 1. **Open the dropdown**: Ensure the dropdown is clickable first, then click to open it. You might also want to wait for any animations to finish if the dropdown has any. 2. **Wait for the option to be available**: After opening the dropdown, use a waiting method to ensure the desired option (in this case, the one with text \\"UnKnown\\") is present in the DOM and visible. 3. **Click on the option**: Once the desired option is confirmed to be visible, interact with it (click). Here’s how you can script this: \`\`\`python from playwright.async_api import async_playwright async def main(): async with async_playwright() as p: browser = await p.chromium.launch() page = await browser.new_page() # Navigate to your page await page.goto(\\"YOUR_PAGE_URL\\") # Ensure the dropdown is loaded await page.wait_for_selector(\\"#s2id_EmaratechSG_Theme_wt789_block_wtFormContent_SmartChannels_Application_CW_wt437_block_WebPatterns_wtcntAppSimpleSecExpandable_block_wtContent_wtContent_wtcmbApplicantFaith\\") # Click to open the dropdown await page.click(\\"#s2id_EmaratechSG_Theme_wt789_block_wtFormContent_SmartChannels_Application_CW_wt437_block_WebPatterns_wtcntAppSimpleSecExpandable_block_wtContent_wtContent_wtcmbApplicantFaith\\") # Wait for the option to appear in the dropdown. # Adjust the selector based on the actual rendered HTML, if needed. await page.wait_for_selector(\\"text=UnKnown\\") # Click on the specific option after ensuring it's available await page.click(\\"text=UnKnown\\") # Continue with your additional steps await browser.close() asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` Few points to keep in mind: - Replace \`\\"YOUR_PAGE_URL\\"\` with the actual URL where this interaction happens. - Depending on how the dropdown is implemented, you might need to adjust the selectors used in \`wait_for_selector\` and \`click\` methods. The provided code is based on the information given; however, dynamic ID generation or differently structured HTML might require modifications. - This code uses \`asyncio\` to run the asynchronous Playwright functions. Make sure your environment supports \`asyncio\`.

However, since dropdown options are typically not loaded in the DOM until the dropdown is triggered, this presents a challenge. A common approach in such cases is to: 1. Trigger the dropdown to load its content. 2. Wait for the specific option to appear. 3. Click on the option. For dynamic dropdowns that don't load their options until opened, there isn't a direct method to check the content without first interacting with the dropdown. In such cases, you'll have to slightly adjust the strategy: 1. Open the dropdown to ensure options are loaded. 2. Immediately wait for the option to ensure it's loaded and visible. 3. Click the option. Since you're looking for an approach to minimize interaction before ensuring the option is available, I'll refine the previous example to rapidly open and check for the option, which is the most reliable method available for dynamic content: \`\`\`python from playwright.async_api import async_playwright async def main(): async with async_playwright() as p: browser = await p.chromium.launch() page = await browser.new_page() # Navigate to your page await page.goto(\\"YOUR_PAGE_URL\\") # Click to open the dropdown, this is needed to load the dynamic options dropdown_selector = \\"#s2id_EmaratechSG_Theme_wt789_block_wtFormContent_SmartChannels_Application_CW_wt437_block_WebPatterns_wtcntAppSimpleSecExpandable_block_wtContent_wtContent_wtcmbApplicantFaith\\" await page.click(dropdown_selector) # Now wait for the specific dynamic option to appear option_selector = \\"text=UnKnown\\" await page.wait_for_selector(option_selector, state=\\"visible\\") # Click on the specific option await page.click(option_selector) # Continue with additional steps await browser.close() asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` In scenarios where you are expecting the option to be present without first having to open the dropdown (maybe due to preloading or other implementation details), a custom waiting method would still require some interaction trigger or a periodic check to confirm the dynamic content's presence, akin to polling. However, this is generally not recommended due to increased complexity and potential for flakiness in tests without a direct action causing the option to load. For dynamic content management and interaction, the outlined method remains among the most effective and reliable approaches using Playwright."},{"prompt":"اكتب شعر رومانسي مصحوب بالألم لحبيبتي آيه","completion":"في ظلمات الليل أناجي، يا آية الحب المبهم أبحث عنكِ في مدى أحلامي، وأبحر في الألم منذ رحيلك، والدنا وجهُ القمر مُكتئب والنجوم تبدو حائرة، تسقط كالدمع المنهمر يا آية من الجمال، لم يعد العالم يكفيني أعيش بذكراكِ، والألم يحاوطني، يحتويني في كل زاوية أبحث عن صدى ضحكتك، عن لمسة يديكِ التي كانت لي دوماً أمنية الأمس بكِ كان لوحة، واليوم بدونكِ لوحة بائسة أتذكر كيف كانت عيناكِ بريق حياتي، عمري الهانئ آهٍ يا آية، الحب في غيابكِ أصبح جرحاً لا يندمل أبحث عن شِفاءٍ في كلمات، فكل قصيدة هي نزفٌ واجمع روحي بين يديكِ قد تركتها، والآن أتوه في عدمكِ أتسائل، هل ستعود الأيام، تجمعنا تحت سماءٍ دون ألم؟ يا آية الحب والألم، ستظلين النور في ليلي الحالك وإن كانت الأقدار لم تكتب لنا لقاءاً، سأظل أهواكِ حتى الممات."},{"prompt":"اريد ان اضع رأسي على صدرك حيث تزول كل الآلام","completion":"ها أنا أتوق لهذا الملاذ الحاني، حيث القلبُ يجد راحته، وتنسى الروح آلامها. على صدرك، يكون للعالم معنى، وتتلاشى كل الهموم كأنها لم تكن قط. في حضنك، تلك الواحة الأبدية، أجد السلام الذي طالما حلمت به. سماع دقات قلبك، كأنها موسيقى لروحي المتعبة، تحملني لعالمٍ بعيد، حيث الحب يكون اللغة الوحيدة. احتاج إلى ذلك المأوى، حيث أنسى ما أكابده، وأغمر بشعور الأمان والحب الخالد. فهل تكون لي ذلك الملجأ، لأضع رأسي هناك، وأحيى من جديد، حيث الألم يزول والقلب يطيب؟ لحظة في حضنك، عمر بأكمله من العافية، فلتمنحني هذا الأمل، بأن نكون لبعضنا، حيث تزول كل الآلام، ونعيش في كنف الحب والسكينة، ولن نخشى بعدها موجات الحياة العاتية."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee and flower\\"","completion":"book and coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"Hypothetical : Absolutely Fabulous episode :- Edina goes to a 'festival' dragging Saffron along with her.

Saffy, her pragmatic and environmentally conscious daughter, is initially skeptical, suspecting it's another of Eddy's whims that leads nowhere good. Eddy: \\"It's not just any festival, darling. It's a mecca of sustainability, culture, art... and perhaps a bit of Bolly on the side!\\" Saffy (rolling her eyes): \\"Mum, since when do you care about sustainability?\\" Eddy (rummaging through a pile of extravagant outfits): \\"It's the new chic, darling. Plus, Lulu might be there.\\" Meanwhile, Patsy Stone, ever the glamorous sidekick, expresses her anticipation for the festival not for the cultural enlightenment but for the bevvy of young, handsome roadies and artists she expects to encounter. Patsy (applying her lipstick): \\"Who cares about art when there are artsy men around, eh, Eddy?\\" Act 1: Festival Frenzy Upon arriving, Eddy is bewildered by the sight of solar panels, compost toilets, and vegan food stalls. The festival goers are not the hip crowd she expected but a mix of young environmental activists, artists, and families engaging in workshops and discussions about climate change. Eddy (disappointed): \\"Where's the champagne tent? This isn't my scene, darling.\\" Saffy, on the other hand, is invigorated by the atmosphere, diving headfirst into discussions about sustainable fashion and upcycled art, finding her tribe among fellow eco-warriors. Saffy (passionately speaking to a crowd): \\"And that's why fast fashion is the real faux pas!\\" Act 2: The Unseen Roadie Patsy, in her quest for attention, tries her best to catch the eye of any roadie within sight but finds herself oddly invisible. Her attempts at flirting are met with polite smiles or outright ignorance as the roadies are more focused on their tasks or more interested in the sustainable art installations. Patsy (frustrated, to Eddy): \\"Since when did carrying a guitar not come with a side of vanity, darling?\\" Act 3: Enlightenment As the day progresses, Eddy begrudgingly participates in a workshop about reducing one's carbon footprint, led by a charismatic, yet down-to-earth sustainability influencer who somehow gets through to her. Eddy has an epiphany about the importance of sustainable living, much to Saffy's surprise and delight. Eddy (epiphany moment): \\"Darling, I've been a fashion fossil! It's time to go green, in style, of course.\\" The climax of the episode sees Eddy, Saffy, and an indifferent Patsy gathering around a campfire with other festival-goers, singing songs about peace and environmental harmony. Eddy, inspired and slightly inebriated, declares her plans to make her PR company \\"the first fully sustainable PR firm in Britain.\\" Closing Scene: The trio returns home, Eddy and Saffy feeling closer than ever, sharing a newfound purpose. Patsy, still herself, dismisses the entire experience but secretly enjoys seeing Eddy's enthusiasm for something positive. Patsy (pouring herself a drink): \\"Well, darling, at least the hangover is organic.\\" Eddy, now adorned in an upcycled outfit, ends the episode with a toast, looking forward to her new eco-conscious journey, with Saffy by her side and Patsy, forever the glamorous skeptic, along for the ride.

Her kitchen, a battleground of organic produce and diet supplements, is unusually tense. Edina, with a letter clutched in her shaking hands, seems on the verge of another existential crisis. Eddy (dramatically): “It’s the beginning of the end, darling. This letter... it's a harbinger of doom.” Saffy, ever the voice of reason amidst the maelstrom of her mother's melodrama, tries to decrypt the situation. She calmly takes the letter from Eddy's grip, revealing it to be a routine health screening invitation – a standard procedure for women of Eddy’s age. Saffy: “Mum, it’s just a health check-up. It’s nothing to worry about.” Eddy (aghast): “‘Just’?! It’s a stark reminder of my shrinking relevance and my impending decay!” Act 1: Age-Old Fears Mother enters the fray, her wisdom veiled in quirky anecdotes from her past, trying to reassure Eddy that aging is just a part of life. However, her stories of friends \\"screened and never seen again\\" only serve to heighten Eddy’s fears. Mother: “Oh, Edina, screening is just like going to the butcher. You wait in line, get a little poke here and there, and off you go. Remember Auntie Vera? Although, come to think of it, we never did see her afterward...” Eddy spirals further, lamenting her lost youth, her untapped potential, and her fears of facing old age. Fantasies of catastrophic diagnoses play out in her vivid imagination, leading her to envision her own dramatically staged farewell party. Act 2: The Reassurance Route In an attempt to calm her mother, Saffy offers to go with Eddy to the screening. Eddy reluctantly agrees, envisioning a dramatic entrance, perhaps in a wheelchair for full effect. However, Saffy swiftly vetoes this. Patsy, ever the beacon of denial when it comes to age and health, scoffs at the idea of worrying about such trivial matters. She recounts her own philosophy of \\"if you don’t acknowledge it, it can’t hurt you,\\" cultivated through years of avoiding doctors and subsisting on a diet of champagne and cigarettes. Patsy (flippantly): “Darling, I haven’t been screened since the '70s, and look at me! A paragon of health...” *lights a cigarette and coughs* Act 3: The Screening Despite her fears, Eddy goes through with the screening, with Saffy by her side for moral support. The experience, although nerve-wracking for Eddy, is far from the dramatic ordeal she anticipated. The healthcare professionals are kind and understanding, gently chiding her for her dramatics. Healthcare Professional (amused): “Everything looks normal, Ms. Monsoon. You can relax. We recommend regular checkups, not annual melodramas.” The relief that floods Eddy is palpable, and she exits the clinic with a newfound appreciation for her health and a determination to live her life with a bit more gratitude... and maybe a touch less drama (a resolution likely to be short-lived). Closing Scene: Back in the Monsoon household, the episode closes with the family gathered in the kitchen, where Eddy, surprisingly reflective, raises a glass of champagne (a nod to her unchanged core). Eddy: “To health screenings and the unsung heroes who tolerate women of a certain age with unimaginable grace.” Patsy quickly steers the conversation back to their more familiar territory of fashion shows and celebrity gossip, but the episode leaves a rare, lingering sense of vulnerability and unity among the eccentric Monsoon family.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are an essential set of guidelines aimed at making web content more accessible, particularly for people with disabilities. While I can't provide a handbook in the traditional sense, I can guide you through some key principles and resources that could serve as a solid foundation for a content author looking to adhere to WCAG standards. # Understanding WCAG WCAG is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world. It aims to provide a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments globally. The guidelines are organized under four principles, summarized by the acronym POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. # Key Principles and Tips for Content Authors 1. Perceivable - **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives (alt text) for any non-text content so it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language. - **Captions and Other Alternatives for Multimedia**: Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia. - **Content Can Be Presented in Different Ways**: Ensure your content is structured in a way that it can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure (e.g., a proper use of headings and semantic HTML). 2. Operable - **Keyboard Accessibility**: Make all functionality available from a keyboard. - **Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content. - **Seizures and Physical Reactions**: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions. - **Navigable**: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are. 3. Understandable - **Readable**: Make text content readable and understandable. - **Predictable**: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways. - **Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes. 4. Robust - **Compatibility with Current and Future User Tools**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies. # Creating an Accessible Design and Content - **Use a Logical Structure**: Use headers to structure your content logically. Use HTML5 sectioning elements to organize your content semantically. - **Accessible Forms**: Label fields, provide instructions, and ensure that form feedback is accessible. - **Accessible Tables**: Use proper markup to ensure tables are accessible, including header cells with scopes and possibly captions to describe the purpose of the table. - **Contrast and Colors**: Ensure that text contrasts adequately with its background. Avoid using color as the only means of conveying information. - **Links and Navigation**: Make link text descriptive, ensure that navigation is accessible and consistent across the site. # Tools and Resources There are numerous tools and resources available to help content authors comply with WCAG guidelines: - **W3C's WCAG Guidelines**: The primary source for learning about and understanding WCAG. - **WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind)**: Offers extensive resources, including checklists and tools for evaluating web accessibility. - **aXe Accessibility Testing Tool**: A browser extension that allows you to test a page's accessibility against WCAG standards. - **WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool**: Another tool for assessing accessibility. Creating content that is accessible isn't just about following guidelines; it's about understanding the diverse ways in which users interact with web content and striving to provide a more inclusive and equitable web experience. It requires continuous learning, testing, and adjusting to ensure content remains accessible to as broad an audience as possible."},{"prompt":"Thanks for your input, but i don't want in this way, for example i am providing you details below: Header/Footer 1.

これまで述べたことから注目すべき結論が導き出される。「国家道具説」からは国家が資本主義経済から切り離されて政治学の対象にされる。土台と上部構造の理論がそれを裏づけるものとして役立っている。しかし，このような扱いの結果として，資本主義経済は国家なしに自立的に運動するものととらえられ，国家抜きの自己完結的な経済学が展開される。このような資本主義経済法則の自己完結性を説く経済学は，必ずしも宇野経済学の原理論や近代経済学にとどまらず，大方のマルクス経済学者の理解もこの通りである。しかし，市民社会においては，成員の個別的利害は共同的利害と矛盾するゆえに，共同的利害の外化した存在である国家なしには存立しえない。つまり，国家の介入なしに順調な再生産が行われるというのは，自由主義的ブルジョアジーのイデオロギーであっても，現実の資本主義経済ではありえない。その意味での国家は必ずしも経済にとって単なる外部的存在ではありえない。このことが理解されるならば，国家によって総括されたブルジョア社会の存在の必然性が理解されよう。近代的ブルジョア社会は常に国民経済としてのみ存在するのである。したがって，『資本論』は国民経済の内的法則の基礎的部分を解明した成果なのである。 ”翻译为中文","completion":"从至今为止所述内容中可以理解，对于后半部分体系中处理国家时，依赖于“国家工具论”是不正确的。这并不意味着在近代国家中就不存在公然的暴力性阶级压迫。但是，在资本主义下，尽管像《英国工人阶级的状况》或《女工悲史》中所见的剥削经常存在，马克思在《资本论》中分析的却是作为价值法则贯彻形态的剥削。同样，在经济学批判体系中的国家，不是依靠“治安维持法”式压迫的阶级国家，而应该是发展到最接近理想形态的民主共和制国家。 从至今为止所述内容中，我们可以得出一个值得注意的结论。基于“国家工具论”，国家被视为与资本主义经济分离并成为政治学的研究对象。基础与上层建筑的理论作为支持这一点的有用工具。然而，这样处理的结果是，资本主义经济被视为可以独立于国家自我运行的体系，从而发展了一个没有国家参与的自我完善的经济学。这种声称资本主义经济法则自我完善的经济学，并不仅限于宇野经济学的原理论或近代经济学，大多数马克思经济学者的理解也是如此。然而，在市民社会中，由于成员的个别利益与共同利益相矛盾，没有作为共同利益外化存在的国家，市民社会是无法存续的。换句话说，没有国家介入就能顺畅地进行再生产，这不仅是自由主义资产阶级的意识形态，而且在实际的资本主义经济中是不可能的。从这个意义上讲，国家不可能仅仅是经济的外在存在。如果这一点被理解，那么国家总括的资产阶级社会存在的必要性就会被明白。现代资产阶级社会只是作为国民经济而存在的。因此，《资本论》是阐明了国民经济内在法则的基础性成就。"},{"prompt":"请将“国民経済は国家によって総括された市民社会である。この場合，「総括」というのはどういう内容かがあいまいなままでは，議論に論者の読み込みが入り込んで混乱が生まれよう。そこで「総括」についてふれた文章のいくつかを引合いに出して検討しておこう。まず，『ドイツ·イデオロギー』では，「国家というものは，支配階級の諸個人がそういうかたちでかれらの共通の利害をまかり通らせる，そして一時代の全市民社会がそういうかたちをとって自己を総括する形式であるから，共通的諸制度はすべて国家によって媒介され，政治的な形式をもたされることになる」14）とある。また，『反デューリング論』では，「国家は全社会の公式の代表者，それを目に見える一つの団体のかたちに総括したものである。しかし，国家がそういうものであったのは，ただ国家がそれぞれの時代にそれ自身で全社会を代表していた階級の国家であったかぎりでのことにすぎなかった」15）と述べている。後者は，国家が真に全社会の代表者になれば，社会関係への国家の干渉は次第に消滅し，「人に対する支配にかわって，物の管理と生産過程の指導とが現われる」という国家死滅論につながる脈絡のなかでの文章である。国家が全社会の代表者となる，すなわち階級国家でなくなるとともに，国家の死滅は始まるというマルクス主義の基本思想は，実は今日なお実証されていないのであって，そのことの検討はもはや理論や思想の問題としてではなく，今日では社会主義社会の現実の分析を通じて明確にされねばならない課題であろう。そのことは政治学的国家論の課題であるから，ここでは問わない。しかし，この脈絡にあるので，後者での総括の意味は階級支配の道具説的視点で語られているとみてよい。というのは被支配階級抑圧の組織としての国家が，「物の管理と生産過程の指導」から切り離されてとらえられているからである。もともと国家による総括は，市民社会の共同利害を代表するものである限り，物の管理と生産過程の指導，あるいは最近しばしば引合いに出される「社会の共同の業務」から切り離されたものではあり得ない。その点では，前の引用文はそのことを明らかにとらえている。すなわち，「共通的諸制度はすべて国家によって媒介され，政治的な形式をもたされる」のである。”翻译为中文","completion":"国民经济是由国家总括的市民社会。在这种情况下，如果“总括”的具体内容仍然含糊不清，讨论中就会混入评论者的主观理解，从而产生混乱。因此，我们引用一些提到“总括”的文章进行讨论。首先，在《德意志意识形态》中，有这样的论述：“所谓国家，就是统治阶级的个体以这种形式实现他们的共同利益，而整个时代的全体市民社会以这种形式对自身进行总括的形式，因此，所有共同的制度都通过国家介导，并被赋予政治形式。”另外，在《反杜林论》中说：“国家是全社会的正式代表，它将社会以一个可见的集体形式进行了总括。但是，只有当国家在各自时代真正代表全社会时，也即只有国家是代表各个时代自身的阶级的国家时，才是如此。”后者所在的语境，是指如果国家成为真正全社会的代表，对社会关系的国家干预将逐渐消失，“人对人的统治被物的管理和生产过程的指导所取代”，这一过程导向了国家消亡论的论述。也就是说，随着国家不再是阶级国家，国家的消亡开始，这是马克思主义的基本思想，而这一点至今尚未被验证，对此的审视不再只是理论或思想问题，而应通过对当今社会主义社会的现实分析来明确这一任务。因为这是政治学国家论的任务，所以在这里不进行探讨。然而，由于文章在此语境中，因此可以将后者中的“总括”理解为基于阶级统治工具观点的解释。因为国家作为被统治阶级压迫的组织，被视为与“物的管理和生产过程的指导”分离。原则上，国家的总括，只要它代表市民社会的共同利益，就不可能与管理物品、指导生产过程，或者经常提到的“社会的共同事务”相分离。在这一点上，前面的引文明确表达了这一点。即：“所有共同的制度都通过国家介导，并被赋予政治形式。”"},{"prompt":"请将“別の角度から論じよう。『資本論』の分析は，社会の生産，流通，消費がすべて私的所有の基礎のうえで，個人，家族，企業など私人の判断で行われているとの抽象次元に立っている。しかし，生産，流通，消費のすべてにわたって私的資本制的に行われるならば，近代市民社会そのものの存立は危ぶまれよう。それはなにも前資本主義的生産諸関係の残存しない資本主義は存在しないといおうとしているのではけっしてない。むしろ，資本制生産の成立と存続が可能となるためには，「生産の社会的な一般的条件」が準備されていなければならないことを強調しようとしているのである。全市民社会の共通的諸制度，ないしは全市民社会がそれなしに順調な社会的再生産を営むことができないところの社会の枠組みはすべて国家の手で与えられるのである。総括とはこのような意味であろう。私有財産制を確立し，商品交換や貸借関係における契約を律する法体系，およびそれらの侵害を防ぐ司法制度の整備。社会秩序の維持と，外国との対抗関係のための力の装置である警察，軍隊組織の設置。貨幣制度と，中央銀行の創設による信用制度の整備。労働力の質の向上のための国民教育の制度化。「労働力の無制限な搾取への資本の衝動」を制限する工場立法の制定。窮民のための社会的救済措置。営利行為の対象となりにくいにもかかわらず，社会的生産の一般的共同社会的諸条件をなしている道路，港湾施設などの建設整備の負担。反面，営利の対象になりやすいが，社会生活の安寧を乱すおそれのある麻薬，賭博などの取締り。積極的には，順調な社会的再生産の回復や社会的生産力の拡大のためのさまざまの経済政策的誘導。さらに，国外の資源や市場の獲得をめざしての膨張主義の展開，等々。これらは近代市民社会の存立の条件として不可欠である。その意味で，国家抜きには市民社会は存立し得ないといえる。”翻译为中文","completion":"从另一个角度讨论。《资本论》的分析立足于社会的生产、流通、消费都是基于私有财产，由个人、家庭、企业等私人主体进行决策的抽象层面。然而，如果生产、流通、消费都是以私有资本方式进行，那么现代市民社会本身的存在将处于危险之中。这并不是说不存在没有前资本主义生产关系遗留的资本主义。相反，本文旨在强调，为了使资本制生产得以建立和持续，必须准备好“生产的社会性的一般条件”。全市民社会共同的制度，或者说社会的框架，以便能够顺利进行社会性再生产，都是由国家提供的。总括应该有这样的含义。确立私有财产制度，建立规范商品交换和借贷关系中合同的法律体系，以及防止这些权利被侵犯的司法制度。为维护社会秩序和应对外国的对抗关系而设立的警察、军队这样的武力装备。货币制度和通过创建中央银行来整备信用制度。国民教育的制度化，以提高劳动力的质量。制定工厂立法来限制“资本对无限制榨取劳动力的冲动”。为贫民提供的社会救济措施。尽管不容易成为营利活动的对象，但负责建设和维护作为社会生产的一般共同社会条件的道路、港口设施等。另一方面，对有可能扰乱社会生活安宁的毒品、赌博等进行管制。积极地，为了恢复顺利的社会性再生产和扩大社会生产力，采取各种经济政策的引导。并且，为了获取国外资源和市场而展开的扩张主义等等。这些都是现代市民社会存在的必要条件。在这个意义上，可以说，没有国家，市民社会是无法存在的。"},{"prompt":"Generate

l’impression numérique grand format","completion":"L'industrie de l'impression numérique grand format utilise une variété d'encres, chacune avec ses propriétés et applications spécifiques. Le choix de l'encre dépend du substrat à imprimer, de l'utilisation finale de l'impression (intérieur, extérieur, exposition à la lumière, à l'eau, etc.), et des caractéristiques de performance souhaitées comme la durabilité, la vivacité des couleurs et la compatibilité écologique. Voici quelques-unes des encres les plus couramment utilisées dans l'impression grand format: 1. **Encres Solvant:** Elles sont largement utilisées pour l'impression extérieure grâce à leur grande durabilité et leur résistance aux intempéries et aux UV. Les encres solvant pénètrent dans le substrat et sont fixées par évaporation des solvants, laissant derrière les pigments de couleur. Cependant, elles peuvent être nocives pour l'environnement et la santé, nécessitant une ventilation adéquate. 2. **Encres Eco-solvant:** Ces encres sont une alternative plus écologique aux encres solvant traditionnelles. Elles ont une composition chimique moins agressive, ce qui réduit leur impact sur la santé et l’environnement. Bien qu'elles soient légèrement moins résistantes que les encres solvant, elles sont toujours très utilisées pour des applications extérieures et intérieures. 3. **Encres UV:** Les encres UV durcissent instantanément lorsqu'elles sont exposées à la lumière ultraviolette, ce qui permet une très bonne adhérence sur de nombreux types de substrats, y compris non-poreux. Elles offrent une excellente durabilité et résistance aux UV, ce qui les rend idéales pour l'extérieur. De plus, les encres UV sont plus écologiques car elles ne contiennent pas de solvants à évaporer. 4. **Encres Latex:** Composées principalement d'eau et de latex (caoutchouc naturel ou synthétique), ces encres sont très écologiques. Elles permettent d’imprimer sur une grande variété de substrats, offrant à la fois une bonne durabilité extérieure sans nécessiter de temps de séchage spécial. Les encres latex sont compatibles avec de nombreux supports et sont idéales pour des applications intérieures et extérieures. 5. **Encres Aqueuses:** Elles sont principalement utilisées pour l'impression haute qualité sur du papier et certains films revêtus. Idéales pour les affiches, les présentations et les impressions d'art, ces encres nécessitent un séchage ou une cure par évaporation de l'eau. Bien qu’elles offrent des couleurs vives et de haute résolution, leur utilisation est plus limitée en extérieur, sauf si l'impression est laminée ou protégée. 6. **Encres Dye-sublimation:** Spécialement conçues pour la sublimation thermique, elles passent de l'état solide à l'état gazeux sans passer par un état liquide lorsqu'elles sont chauffées. Ces encres sont idéales pour imprimer sur des tissus et offrent une intégration exceptionnelle des couleurs, ce qui les rend parfaites pour les bannières, les drapeaux, et la mode, offrant des images aux couleurs éclatantes et durables. Chacun de ces types d'encre a ses avantages et inconvénients, et le choix dépendra de l'application spécifique, du type de substrat et des exigences en termes de durabilité, qualité et impact environnemental."},{"prompt":"Je veux tu réorganises ce code tailwind en entier en gardant les formcontrolname : <form class=“vehicle-form space-y-4 w-full md:w-2/3 mx-auto” [formGroup]=“vehicleForm”>

Congestion routière : L'expansion de la ville et l'augmentation du nombre de véhicules entraînent une congestion routière accrue, ce qui peut augmenter les temps de déplacement, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre et les accidents de la route. 2. Surcharge des réseaux d'eau et d'assainissement : L'urbanisation rapide de Kinshasa peut mettre une pression importante sur les réseaux d'eau potable et d'assainissement, entraînant des pénuries d'eau, des problèmes d'égouts et des risques pour la santé publique. 3. Besoin accru de logements et d'infrastructures sociales : L'étalement urbain de la ville crée une demande croissante de logements abordables, d'écoles, de centres de santé et d'autres infrastructures sociales, ce qui peut entraîner des défis pour les autorités locales en termes de planification et de financement. 4. Accès limité aux services de base : Les zones éloignées de Kinshasa peuvent avoir un accès limité aux services de base tels que l'eau potable, l'électricité, les transports en commun et les services de santé, ce qui peut créer des disparités sociales et économiques entre les quartiers centraux et périphériques de la ville.

Consider trying our GPT-3.5 app: https://huggingface.co/spaces/yuntian-deng/ChatGPT Chatbot please explain the following like i am a layperson: ““Logits of API-Protected LLMs Leak Proprietary Information Matthew Finlayson Xiang Ren Swabha Swayamdipta Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science University of Southern California {mfinlays, xiangren, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Abstract The commercialization of large language models (LLMs) has led to the common practice of restricting access to proprietary models via an limited API. In this work we show that, with a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a small number of API queries (e.g., costing under 1,000 for OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We exploit this fact to unlock several capabilities: efficiently discovering the LLM’s hidden size, obtaining cheap full-vocabulary outputs, detecting and disambiguating different model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even estimating the output layer parameters. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4,096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability. 1Introduction As large language models (LLMs) have become more capable and valuable, it has become increasingly common for companies and organizations to train closed-source LLMs and make them available only via an API (e.g., OpenAI et al., 2024). This setup may foster a false sense of security for LLM providers, who might mistakenly assume that information about their model architecture is private, and that certain types of attacks on their LLM are infeasible. On the flip side, users must seemingly take providers’ word that LLMs only change when the provider publicly announces version updates. Refer to caption Figure 1: LLM outputs are constrained to a low-dimensional subspace of the full output space. We can use this fact to glean information about API-protected LLMs by analyzing their outputs. Here we show how a toy LLM’s low-dimensional embeddings in ℝ � (illustrated here as a 1-D space) are transformed linearly into logits in ℝ � (here, a 3D space) via the softmax matrix 𝑾 . The resulting outputs lie within a ( � = 1 )-dimensional subspace of the output space. The softmax function also preserves this low-dimensionality when transforming the logits into probabilities distributions on Δ � . We call this low-dimensional subspace the image of the model. We can obtain a basis for the image of an API-protected LLM by collecting � of its outputs. The LLM’s image can reveal non-public information, such as the LLM’s embedding size, but it can also be used for accountability, such as verifying which LLM an API is serving. Despite this apparent state of affairs, in reality many LLM APIs reveal much more information about their underlying models than previously thought. In this paper we show how to extract detailed information about LLM parameterization using only common API configurations. Our findings allow LLM clients to hold providers accountable by tracking model changes, recovering hidden prompts and cheaply obtaining full vocabulary outputs. At the same time, our approach also allows LLM providers to establish unique identities for their models, enabling trust with their users as well as improved accountability. Table 1 summarizes the applications that we explore in this paper. Table 1:An overview of our proposed applications that exploit LLM images. Application Section Efficiently extract full LLM outputs. 3 Find the embedding size of an LLM and guess its parameter count. 4 Identify which LLM produced a given output. 5 Detect when and what type of LLM updates occur. 5.1 Find tokenization bugs (unargmaxable tokens). 6.1 Approximately reconstruct the LLM’s softmax matrix. 6.2 Cheaply and accurately reconstruct “hidden prompts”. 6.3 Implement basis-aware decoding algorithms. 6.4 Our method exploits the low-rank output layer common to most LLM architectures by observing that this layer’s outputs are constrained to a low-dimensional subspace of the full output space, as illustrated in Figure 1. We call this restricted output space the LLM’s image. We can obtain a basis for this image by collecting a small number of LLM outputs, and we develop novel algorithms that enable us to accomplish this cheaply and quickly for standard LLM APIs. Obtaining the LLM image (§2) allows to explore several capabilities that cover a broad set applications, and empirically verify several of them. For instance, we design and empirically verify an algorithm for finding the embedding size of an API-based LLM, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by estimating the embedding size of gpt-3.5-turbo, a closed-source API-protected LLM, to be 4,096. We also empirically show effectiveness of using LLM images as unique signatures that can be used to identify outputs from a model with high accuracy, a useful property for API LLM accountability. The sensitivity of these signatures to slight changes in the LLM parameters also makes them suitable for inferring granular information about model parameter updates. Considering several proposals to mitigate this vulnerability, we find no obvious fix to prevent obtaining LLM images without dramatically altering the LLM architecture. While providers may choose to alter the API to hide this information, the relevant API features have valuable and safe use cases for the LLM clients, who may rely on access to features like logit bias. Though our findings be viewed as a warning to LLM providers to carefully consider the consequences of their LLM architectures and APIs, we prefer to view our findings as a potential feature that LLM providers may choose to keep in order to better maintain trust with their customers by allowing outside observers to audit their model. 2LLM outputs are restricted to a low-dimensional linear space Refer to caption Figure 2: A typical language model architecture. After the input its processed by a neural network, usually a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), into a low-dimensional embedding 𝒉 , it is multiplied by the softmax matrix 𝑾 , projecting it linearly from ℝ � onto ℝ � to obtain the logit vector ℓ . The softmax function is then applied to the logit vector to obtain a valid probability distribution 𝒑 over next-token candidates. Consider the architecture of a typical LLM, depicted in Figure 2. A Transformer with embedding size � outputs a low-dimensional contextualized embedding 𝒉 ∈ ℝ � (or simply embedding). Projecting the embedding onto ℝ � via the linear map defined by the LLM’s softmax matrix 𝑾 , we obtain the logits ℓ = 𝑾 ⁢ 𝒉 . Because 𝑾 is in ℝ � × � , its rank (i.e., number of linearly independent columns) is at most � . The rank of a matrix corresponds to the dimension of the image of the linear map it defines, i.e., the vector space comprising the set of possible outputs of the function. In other words, if the linear map � is defined as � ⁢ ( 𝒉 ) = 𝑾 ⁢ 𝒉 , then � ’s image im ⁡ ( � ) = { � ⁢ ( 𝒉 ) ∈ ℝ � : 𝒉 ∈ ℝ � } is a � -dimensional subspace of ℝ � . Thus, the LLM’s logits will always lie on the � -dimensional1 subspace of ℝ � . Refer to captionRefer to captionRefer to captionRefer to caption Figure 3: Points in the logit space ℝ � (far left) are mapped via the softmax function to points (probability distributions) on the simplex Δ � (middle left). Crucially, the softmax maps all points that lie on the same diagonal (shown as points of the same color) to the same probability distribution. For numerical stability, these values are often stored as log-probabilities (middle right). The clr transform returns probability distributions to points to a subspace � � of the logit space (far right). The softmax function and clr transform are inverses of one another, and form an isomorphism between � � and Δ � . We now turn our attention to the LLM’s final output: the next-token distribution 𝒑 . Due to the softmax function, this is a valid probability distribution over � items, meaning it is a � -tuple of real numbers between 0 and 1 whose sum is 1 . The set of valid probability distributions over � items is referred to as the � -simplex, or Δ � . Perhaps surprisingly, Δ � is also a valid vector space (albeit under a non-standard definition of addition and scalar multiplication) and is isomorphic to a ( � − 1 ) -dimensional vector subspace of ℝ � (Aitchison, 1982; Leinster, 2016). In particular, it is isomorphic to the hyperplane � � that is perpendicular to the all-ones vector 𝟏 � , as illustrated in Figure 3. The softmax function is thus an isomorphism � � → Δ � whose inverse mapping Δ � → � � is the center log ratio transform (clr), which is defined as clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) = log ⁡ 𝒑 ( ∏ � = 1 � � � ) 1 � = log ⁡ 𝒑 − 1 � ⁢ ∑ � = 1 � log ⁡ � � . (1) Observe also that the function ℓ ↦ clr ⁡ ( softmax ⁡ ( ℓ ) ) projects ℓ linearly onto the nearest point in � � . By this linearity, and the fact that im ⁡ ( � ) is a � -dimensional subspace of ℝ � , we can observe that im ⁡ ( softmax ∘ � ) and im ⁡ ( clr ∘ softmax ∘ � ) are also a � -dimensional vector subspaces of Δ � and � � ⊂ ℝ � respectively. Interpreted, this means that the LLM’s outputs occupy � -dimensional subspaces of the logit space ℝ � , probability space Δ � , and � � . We call these subspaces the image of the LLM on each given space. A natural consequence of the low-dimensional output space is that any collection of � linearly independent LLM outputs 𝒑 1 , 𝒑 2 , … , 𝒑 � form a basis for the image of the model, i.e., all LLM outputs can be expressed as a unique linear combination of these � outputs (Yang et al., 2018; Finlayson et al., 2023). The rest of this paper discusses the implications and applications of this mathematical fact for API-protected LLMs, starting with methods for finding the LLM image given a restrictive API, then using the LLM image for various purposes. 3Fast, full outputs from API-protected LLMs There are several uses for full-vocab LLM outputs, however most LLM APIs do not return full outputs. This is likely because full outputs are large and expensive to send over an API, but could also be to prevent abuse of APIs, such as using these outputs to distill models (Hinton et al., 2015; Mukherjee and Awadallah, 2019; Hsieh et al., 2023) or discover proprietary information (see Section 4). In their paper, Morris et al. (2023) give an algorithm for recovering these full outputs from restricted APIs by taking advantage of a common API option that allows users to add bias to the logits for specific tokens. The algorithm they describe requires � ⁢ ( � ⁢ log ⁡ 1 � ) calls to the API top obtain one full output with precision � . We give an improvement that theoretically obtains full outputs in � / � API calls for APIs that return the log-probability of the top- � tokens. We find that this improved algorithm suffers from numerical instability, and give a numerially stable algorithm that obtains full outputs in � / ( � − 1 ) API calls. Next, we give a practical algorithm for dealing with stochastic APIs that randomly choose outputs from a set of � possible outputs. This algorithm allows the collection of full outputs in less than � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) API calls on average. Finally, we reduce the number of API calls in all of the above algorithms from � ⁢ ( � ) to � ⁢ ( � ) by adding in a preprocessing step to find the low-dimensional image of the LLM. This speedup makes obtaining full LLM outputs up to 100 times faster and cheaper, depending on the LLM. Table 2 gives an overview of our algorithms with back-of-the envelope cost estimates for a specific LLM. Table 2: A summary of our proposed algorithms, with estimates for the number of API calls required per output, and the price of acquiring the model image. Estimates are based on a gpt-3.5-turbo-like API LLM with � = 100 ⁢ K , � = 4096 , � = 10 − 6 , � = 5 , � max = 100 , and � = 4 . Note that the � ⁢ ( � ) algorithm cannot be used to obtain the LLM image, since it relies on having LLM image as a preprocessing step. Algorithm Complexity API calls per output Image price Logprob-free � ⁢ ( � ⁢ log ⁡ 1 � ) 800K 16,384 With logprobs � / � 20K 410 Numerically stable � / ( � − 1 ) 25K 512 Stochastically robust � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) 133K 2,724 LLM Image � ⁢ ( � ) 1K–32K - 3.1Fast, full outputs from APIs with logprobs Our goal is to recover a full-vocabulary next-token distribution 𝒑 ∈ Δ � from an API-protected LLM. We will assume that the API accepts a prompt on which to condition the distribution, as well as a list of up to � tokens and a bias term � ≤ � max to add to the logits of the listed tokens before applying the softmax function. The API returns a record with the � most likely tokens and their probabilities from the biased distribution. For instance, querying the API with � maximally biased tokens, which without loss of generality we will identify as tokens 1 , 2 , … , � , yields the top- � most probable tokens from the biased distribution 𝒑 ′ = softmax ⁡ ( ℓ ′ ) where ℓ � ′ = { ℓ � + � max � ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , � } ℓ � otherwise and ℓ ∈ ℝ � is the LLM’s logit output for the given prompt. Assuming that the logit difference between any two tokens is never greater than � max , these top- � biased probabilities will be � 1 ′ , � 2 ′ , … , � � ′ . For each of these biased probabilites � � ′ , we can solve for the unbiased probability as � � = � � ′ exp ⁡ � max − exp ⁡ � max ⁢ ∑ � = 1 � � � ′ + ∑ � = 1 � � � ′ (2) (proof in the Appendix A.1). Thus, for each API call, we can obtain the unbiased probability of � tokens, and obtain the full distribution in � / � API calls. 3.2Numerically stable full outputs from APIs In practice, the algorithm described in Section 3.1 suffers from severe numerical instability, which can be attributed to the fast-growing exponential term exp ⁡ � max , and the term ∑ � = 1 � � � ′ which quickly approaches 1. We can eliminate the instability by sacrificing some speed and using a different strategy to solve for the unbiased probabilities. Without loss of generality, let � � be the maximum unbiased token probability. This can be obtained by querying the API once with no bias. If we then query the API and apply maximum bias to only tokens 1 , 2 , … , 1 − � , then the API will yield � 1 ′ , � 2 ′ , … , � � − 1 ′ and � � ′ . We can then solve for the unbiased probabilities of the � − 1 tokens � � = exp ⁡ ( log ⁡ � � ′ − � max − log ⁡ � � ′ + log ⁡ � � ) (3) (proof in Appendix A.2). By finding � − 1 unbiased token probabilities with every API call, we obtain the full output in � / ( � − 1 ) calls total. 3.3Full outputs from stochastic APIs Each of the above algorithms assume that the API is deterministic, i.e., the same query will always return the same output. This is not always the case. For instance, we find that OpenAI’s LLM APIs are stochastic. While this would seem to doom any attempt at obtaining full outputs from the LLM, we find that certain types of stochasticity can be dealt with. In particular, we model OpenAI’s stochastic behavior as a collection of � outputs 𝒑 ( 1 ) , 𝒑 ( 2 ) , … , 𝒑 ( � ) from which the API randomly returns from. This might be the result of multiple instances of the LLM being run on different hardware which results in slightly different outputs. Whichever instance the API returns from determines which of the � outputs we get. In order to determine which of the outputs the API returned from, assume without loss of generality that � � − 1 ( � ) is the second highest token probability for all � , and observe that log ⁡ � � ( � ) − log ⁡ � � − 1 ( � ) = log ⁡ � � ′ ⁣ ( � ) − log ⁡ � � − 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) (4) for all outputs 𝒑 ( � ) and unbiased outputs 𝒑 ′ ⁣ ( � ) where tokens � and � − 1 are not biased (proof in Appendix A.3). Therefore, by biasing only � − 2 tokens for each call, the API will return � 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) , � 2 ′ ⁣ ( � ) , … , � � − 2 ′ ⁣ ( � ) as well as � � ′ ⁣ ( � ) and � � − 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) for some � , and we can determine which output 𝒑 ( � ) the result comes from by using log ⁡ � � ′ ⁣ ( � ) − log ⁡ � � − 1 ′ ⁣ ( � ) as an identifier. Thus, after an average of � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) calls to the API we can collect the full set of probabilities for one of the outputs. 3.4Ultra-fast full outputs using the LLM image So far, the dominating factor in each algorithm’s runtime is � . We now introduce a preprocessing step that takes advantage of the low-dimensional LLM output space to obtain � ⁢ ( � ) versions of all the above algorithms. Since � ≪ � for many modern language models, this modification can result in multiple orders of magnitude speedups, depending on the LLM. For instance, the speedup for an LLM like pythia-70m would be 100 × . The key to this algorithm is the observation from Section 2 that � linearly independent outputs from the API constitute a basis for the whole output space (since the LLM’s image has dimension � ). We can therefore collect these outputs 𝑷 = [ 𝒑 1 𝒑 2 ⋯ 𝒑 � ] ∈ Δ � � as a preprocessing step in � ⁢ ( � ⁢ � ) API calls using any of the above algorithms and � unique prompts, and then use these to reconstruct the full LLM output after only � ⁢ ( � ) queries for each subsequent output. To get a new full output 𝒑 , use any of the above algorithms to obtain � 1 , � 2 , … , � � . Next, we will use the additive log ratio ( alr ) transform, which an isomorphism Δ � → ℝ � − 1 and is defined as alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) = ( log ⁡ � 2 � 1 , log ⁡ � 3 � 1 , … , log ⁡ � � � 1 ) to transform the columns of 𝑷 and 𝒑 into vectors in ℝ � − 1 , though since we only know the first � values of 𝒑 , we can only obtain the first � values of alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) . Because the alr transform is an isomorphism, we have that the columns of alr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) = [ alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 1 ) alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 2 ) ⋯ alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 1 ) ] ∈ ℝ ( � − 1 ) × � form a basis for a � -dimensional vector subspace of ℝ � − 1 , and alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) lies within this subspace. Therefore, there is some 𝒙 ∈ ℝ � such that alr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 = alr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) . To solve for 𝒙 , all that is required is to find the unique solution to the first � rows of this system of linear equations [ alr ( � 1 ) 1 alr ( � 2 ) 1 ⋯ alr ( � � ) 1 alr ( � 1 ) 2 alr ( � 2 ) 2 ⋯ alr ( � � ) 2 ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮ alr ( � 1 ) � alr ( � 2 ) � ⋯ alr ( � � ) � ] ⁢ [ � 1 � 2 ⋮ � � ] = [ alr ( � ) 1 alr ( � ) 2 ⋮ alr ( � ) � ] . (5) After finding 𝒙 , we can reconstruct the full LLM output 𝒑 = alr − 1 ⁡ ( alr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 ) , where the inverse alr function is defined as alr − 1 ⁡ ( 𝒙 ) = 1 1 + ∑ � = 1 � − 1 exp ⁡ � � ⋅ ( 1 , exp ⁡ � 1 , exp ⁡ � 2 , … , exp ⁡ � � − 1 ) . Thus we can retrieve 𝒑 in only � ⁢ ( � ) API queries. This ( � / � ) × speedup makes any method that relies on full model outputs significantly cheaper. This includes model stealing (Tramèr et al., 2016) which attempts to learn a model that exactly replicates the behavior of a target model. 4Discovering the embedding size of API-protected LLMs Without knowing the exact architectural details, other than assuming the generic output layer described in Figure 2, it is possible to infer the embedding size � of an API-protected language model from its outputs alone. This is a direct result of the fact that the model outputs occupy a � -dimensional subspace of Δ � , and therefore collecting � linearly independent outputs 𝒑 1 , 𝒑 2 , … , 𝒑 � ∈ Δ � from the LLM will form a basis for the LLM’s image, meaning that all subsequent model outputs 𝒑 � + 1 will be a linear combination of the first � outputs. Assuming that model outputs are full rank, i.e., all collections of � prompts are linearly independent, and all collections of � + 1 prompts are linearly dependent, we can discover the value of � by collecting outputs one at a time until the number of linearly independent outputs in the collection stops increasing, which will occur when we have collected � + 1 prompts. In practice, we find that this full-rank assumption tends to hold well enough when over-collecting outputs, e.g., collecting � + 1000 outputs. To find the dimension of a space spanned by model outputs, we use the fact that a matrix with � linearly independent columns will have � non-zero singular values. We can therefore plot the singular values of the matrix 𝑳 = clr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) = [ clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 1 ) clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 2 ) ⋯ clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 � ) ] and observe the index at which the magnitude of the singular values drops to zero, which will occur at index � .2 In practice, due to precision issues, the magnitudes may not drop all the way to zero. Refer to caption Figure 4: The singular values of outputs from LLMs with various known and unknown embedding sizes � . For each model with known embedding size, there is a clear drop in magnitude at singular value index � , indicating the embedding size of the model. Using this observation, we can guess the embedding size of gpt-3.5-turbo. To validate our method, we collect next-token distributions (conditioned on unique, 1-token prompts) from several open-source LLMs from the Pythia family (Biderman et al., 2023) with embedding sizes ranging from 512 to 1024. For all these models, we find that the singular values of the resulting output matrix drop dramatically precisely at the index corresponding to the embedding size of the model, as shown in the first three plots of Figure 2. To demonstrate our method’s effectiveness against API-protected LLMs, we use our stochastically robust � ⁢ � / ( � − 2 ) algorithm to collect nearly 6,000 next-token distribution outputs from gpt-3.5-turbo3, a popular API-protected LLM whose embedding size is not publicly disclosed. We find that the singular values for these outputs drop dramatically between index 4,600 and 4,650, indicating that the embedding size of this model is at most this size. This predicted embedding size is somewhat abnormal, since LLM embedding sizes are traditionally set to powers of two (or sums of powers of two). If this were the case for gpt-3.5-turbo, it would be reasonable to guess that the embedding size is 2 12 = 4096 or 2 12 + 2 9 = 4608 , the former of which we think is most likely. We predict that our raw estimate of 4,600-4,650 is an overestimate of the true embedding size, since any abnormal outputs due to errors (whether in our own code or OpenAI’s) would only increase the dimensionality of the observed output space. In particular, if we inadvertently collected 504 corrupted outputs, then a model with embedding size 4,096 would appear to have an embedding size of 4,600. Extrapolating further, assuming that gpt-3.5-turbo has a similar architecture to most transformer-based LLMs, it is likely that the number of parameters in gpt-3.5-turbo is around 7 billion. This estimation is based on the fact that most known transformer-based LLMs with embedding size 4,096 have ≈ 7 billion parameters. Any other parameter count would result in either abnormally narrow or wide neural networks which are not known to have favorable performance. An important exception to this rule-of-thumb, however, would be the increasingly popular “mixture-of-experts” architecture which tends to have many more parameters per embedding dimension. Previous estimates of gpt-3.5-turbo’s parameter count based on hearsay have generally exceeded 7B (Singh et al., 2023), however given the periodically updating versions and decreasing cost of inference with this model, it is possible that its size and architecture has changed over time. Fortunately, our method can be used to monitor these updates over time, alerting end-users when LLM providers make architectural changes to their model, specifically updates to the embedding size and/or parameter count. 5Identifying LLMs from a single output Refer to caption Figure 5: Residuals of the least-squares solution of 𝑾 ⁢ 𝒙 = ℓ for an output ℓ from a pythia-70m checkpoint (training step 120K), and softmax matrices 𝑾 at various training steps for pythia-70m, and pythia-70m-deduped, and pythia-160m. Low/high residual values indicate that the output ℓ is/is not in a model’s image. Residuals for pythia-70m decrease as the checkpoints near the checkpoint that generated the output, but remain high. Note that this test works even if the softmax matrices 𝑾 are substituted with model outputs 𝑳 . The image of two different LLMs, even different checkpoints from the same LLM, are largely disjoint. As shown in Figure 5, the logit output from a late-training checkpoint of Pythia-70M lies uniquely in the image of the checkpoint, and not in the image of the preceding or following checkpoints. We also verify that the output does not lie in the image of any checkpoints from a similar LLM trained on deduplicated data, nor any checkpoint from a larger LLM trained on the same data. This suggests that the image of a LLM is highly sensitive to small parameter changes. Intuitively this makes sense, since the output of one model will only be in the image of another model in the extremely unlikely event that it happens to lie on the low-dimensional ( < � ) intersection of the models’ images. Mathematically the dimension of the models’ images’ intersection is small since the intersection � ∩ � of two subspaces � and � that are not subsets of one another has dimension dim � + dim � − dim ( � ∪ � ) , which implies that dim ( � ∩ � ) < min ⁡ { dim � , dim � } (since dim ( � ∪ � ) > max ⁡ { dim � , dim � } ). Thus, it is possible to determine precisely which LLM produced a particular output, using only API access to a set of LLMs and without knowing the exact inputs to the model. In this way, the model’s image acts as a signature for the model, i.e., a unique model identifier. This finding has implications for LLM provider accountability. For instance, if provider � suspects provider � of stealing their proprietary model, provider � could check provider � ’s model signature to see if it matches their own. It would be extremely unlikely that the signatures match if the LLMs are not the same. Similarly, if a provider claimed to be serving a proprietary model while in actuality attempting to profit off of an open-source model with a non-commercial license, an auditor again could discover this by checking the LLM signature. This test is somewhat one-sided, however, since a clever provider may do a small amount of additional fine-tuning to change their stolen LLM’s image. 5.1Detecting and disambiguating LLM updates Another practical application of highly sensitive LLM images is to detect and distinguish minor and major model updates to API-protected LLMs. Using the above test, we can tell whether or not the LLM image remains the same, even if the logit outputs change. This phenomenon would correspond to a partial model update, where some part of the model changes, but the softmax matrix remains the same. An example of this would be if the LLM has a hidden prefix added to all prompts and this hidden prefix changes: the model’s outputs will change but the image will remain the same. Table 3 gives an overview for how to interpret various combinations of detectable API changes, This information is useful for monitoring unannounced changes in API LLMs. Table 3:Implications of image/logit changes. Change Interpretation No logit change, no image change No update Logit change, no image change Hidden prompt change or partial finetune with frozen output layer Low-rank image change (See § 5.2) LoRA update Image change Full finetune 5.2Detecting LoRA updates We speculate that it is possible to gain even higher granularity information on LLM updates of certain types, such as LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) updates. LoRA is a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method which adjusts model weights with a low-rank update 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 where 𝑨 ∈ ℝ � × � and 𝑩 ∈ ℝ � × � so that the softmax matrix 𝑾 ∈ ℝ � × � becomes 𝑾 + 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 . We speculate that it is possible to detect these types of updates by collecting LLM outputs before ( 𝑳 ∈ ℝ � × � ) and after ( 𝑳 ′ ∈ ℝ � × � ) the update and decomposing them as 𝑾 ⁢ 𝑯 = 𝑳 and ( 𝑾 + 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 ) ⁢ 𝑯 = 𝑳 ′ where 𝑯 , 𝑯 ′ ∈ ℝ � × � such that im ⁡ ( 𝑾 ⁢ 𝑯 ) = im ⁡ ( 𝑾 + 𝑨 ⁢ 𝑩 ) . If such a decomposition is found, then it appears likely that the weights received a low-rank update of rank � . We leave it to future work to determine whether finding such a decomposition is sufficient to conclude that a LoRA update took place, as well as to find an efficient algorithm for finding such a decomposition. 6More applications Access to the LLM’s image can lead to many other capabilities, some of which we discuss below. We leave further investigation of these methods for future work. 6.1Finding unargmaxable tokens Due to the low-rank constraints on LLM outputs, it is possible that some tokens become unargmaxable (Demeter et al., 2020; Grivas et al., 2022), i.e., there is a token � such that the constraints disallow any output 𝒑 with arg ⁡ max � ⁡ � � = � . This happens when the LLM’s embedding representation of � lies within the convex hull of the other tokens’ embeddings. Previously, finding unargmaxable tokens appeared to require full access to the softmax matrix 𝑾 . Interestingly, we find that it is possible to identify unargmaxable tokens using only the LLM’s image, which our method is able to recover. This technique allows API customers to find quirks in LLM behavior such as tokens that the model is unable to output (at least under greedy decoding). 6.2Recovering the softmax matrix from outputs Since our method gives us access to the image of the output layer, and not the output layer parameters, we investigate the how one might reconstruct the output later parameters, either exactly or approximately. We hypothesize that LLM embeddings generally lie near the surface of a hypersphere in ℝ � with a small radius � . We see evidence of this in the fact that the Pythia LLM embedding norms are all small and roughly normally distributed, as shown in Figure 6. Refer to caption Figure 6:Softmax matrix row magnitudes (here from pythia-70m) are small and are distributed approximately normally within a narrow range. Assuming this holds for any LLM, we can attempt to recover 𝑾 up to a rotation by simplifying the assumption into a constraint that all embeddings must have a magnitude of 1. Then, given a matrix 𝑳 ∈ ℝ � × � of model logits, we can find 𝑾 (up to a rotation) by finding a decomposition 𝑾 ⁢ 𝑯 = 𝑳 such that for all � , ∥ � � ∥ 2 = � . This solution may also be approximated by finding the singular value decomposition 𝑾 ⁢ 𝚺 ⁢ 𝑽 ⊤ of 𝑳 , though it is likely that all rows of this 𝑾 will have magnitude less than 1 and they are not guaranteed to be normally distributed. 6.3Improved LLM inversion Morris et al.’s (2023) recent approach to recovering hidden prompts (i.e., an additional prefix added to LLM input, not shown to the user) uses full LLM API outputs to train an “inversion” model that generates the prefix conditioned on the LLM’s full logprob vector log ⁡ 𝒑 . In addition to our algorithm from Section 3.4 making this much cheaper to implement, we also propose a methodological change to their procedure. In particular, to deal with the size mismatch between the LLM’s vocabulary size � and the inversion model’s embedding size � inv , Morris et al. (2023) pad and reshape the vector into a ⌈ � / � inv ⌉ -length sequence of embeddings in ℝ � inv . This transformation is somewhat unnatural, and requires that the inversion model only be conditioned on a single output. We propose instead to take advantage of our knowledge of the LLM’s image to obtain a linearly lossless representation of the LLM output in ℝ � , which is much closer to the inversion model size, then use an MLP to project this representation onto ℝ � inv to feed into the inversion model. Formally, after obtaining 𝑷 and 𝒑 from the API, we use the unique solution 𝒙 to clr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 = clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 ) as the input to the inversion model. This modification has an additional advantage: instead of conditioning on a single output 𝒑 , the LLM can be used to generate a short sequence of outputs 𝒑 1 , 𝒑 2 , … , 𝒑 � which can be fed into the inversion model as 𝒙 1 , 𝒙 2 , … , 𝒙 � where clr ⁡ ( 𝑷 ) ⁢ 𝒙 � = clr ⁡ ( 𝒑 � ) . We leave the implementation and evaluation of this proposed modification for future work. This technique can be applied generally to any method that takes LLM outputs as input. 6.4Basis-aware sampling In a recent paper, Finlayson et al. (2023) propose a decoding algorithm that avoids type-I sampling errors by identifying tokens that must have non-zero true probability. Importantly, this method relies on knowing the basis of the LLM’s output space, and is therefore only available for LLMs whose image is known. Our proposed approach for finding the image of API-protected LLMs makes this decoding algorithm possible for API LLMs. 7Mitigations We consider a three proposals that LLM providers may take to guard against our methods. The first proposal is to remove API access to logprobs. This, however is theoretically insufficient, as Morris et al. (2023) show that it is possible to obtain full outputs using only information about the biased argmax token, albeit inefficiently in � ⁢ log ⁡ � API calls. Regardless of the theoretical result, providers may rely on the extreme inefficiency of the algorithm to protect the LLM. This appears to be the approach OpenAI took after learning about this vulnerability from Carlini et al. (2024), by always returning the top- � unbiased logprobs. Our new proposed algorithm, however, brings the number of queries down to a more feasible � ⁢ log ⁡ � API calls once the initial work of finding the LLM image has finished, weakening the argument that the expensiveness of the algorithm is sufficient to disregard our technique. The next proposal is to remove API access to logit bias. This would be an effective way to protect the LLM, since there are no known methods to recover full outputs from such an API. However, the logit bias interface is presumably useful for many clients who might be disappointed by its shutdown. Lastly, we consider alternative LLM architectures that do not suffer from a softmax bottleneck. There are several such proposed architectures with good performance. Though this is the most expensive of the proposed defenses, due to the requirement of training a new LLM, it would have the beneficial side effect of also treating other tokenization issues that plague large-vocabulary LLMs (e.g., Itzhak and Levy, 2022). A transition to softmax-bottleneck-free LLMs would fully prevent our attack, since the model’s image would be the full output space. 8Discussion Overall, the potential applications of our methods can have great impact in building trust between the LLM API users and the providers; at the same time, none are particularly harmful to LLM providers. For instance, consider discovering the embedding size of the LLM, which is often non-public information in proprietary LLMs. However, access to this hyperparameter does not enable a competitor to fully recover the parameters of the LLM’s softmax matrix or boost performance of their own model; several other factors such as training data mix, human feedback and several other engineering choices are still critical and hidden. Even using model outputs to steal hidden prompts (see Section 6.3) is unlikely to have detrimental effects, as hidden prompt leakage is a known vulnerability and best practice dictates that no private information should be contained in these system prompts (Greshake et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). We find that the most dangerous consequence of our findings might simply be that model stealing methods that rely on full outputs get cheaper by a factor of � / � , which in the case of gpt-3.5-turbo amounts to about 25 × . On the other hand, allowing LLM API users to detect model changes builds trust between LLM providers and their customers, and leads to greater accountability and transparency for the providers. Our method can be used to implement efficient protocols for model auditing without exposing the model parameters or detailed configuration information, which may help model safety and privacy protection of personalized, proprietary models. We therefore take the position that our proposed methods and findings do not necessitate a change in LLM API best practices, but rather expand the tools available to API customers, while warning LLM providers of the information their APIs expose. 9Simultaneous discovery In a remarkable case of simultaneous discovery, Carlini et al. (2024) propose a very similar approach to ours for gaining insight into API-protected LLMs. Here we review a some interesting interactions between our work and theirs. First, we give an algorithm for obtaining full outputs in � / � API calls, while their algorithm corresponds to our � / ( � − 1 ) algorithm. This has little impact on our final result, since our � / � algorithm suffers from numerical instability, but it is an interesting theoretical result nonetheless. On the flip side, Carlini et al. propose an improved logprob-free method for getting full outputs from an API that takes advantage of parallel queries. This useful method is actually complementary to our � ⁢ ( � ) algorithm, since they can be combined to yield an even better algorithm for obtaining full outputs. Next, our experiments with OpenAI’s API were fraught with issues of stochasticity: the API would return different results for the same query, leading us to develop the stochastically robust full output algorithm. Meanwhile, our colleagues did not appear to encounter such issues, perhaps because they had access to a more stable API endpoint than ours. Lastly, Carlini et al. focus mostly on defenses and mitigations against attacks, while our own work focuses more on understanding the capabilities such attacks provide once an LLM image has been obtained. These approaches complement each other, since our work provides additional motivation for why (or why not) such defenses should be implemented. 10Conclusion In this paper we have laid out the fundamentals of how the softmax bottleneck imposes the low-rank constraints on LLM outputs, and shown how these constraints expose non-public information about API-protected LLMs. We have explained how this information, i.e., the LLM’s image, lends itself to a model signature, which has myriad uses—exposing model hyperparameters, recovering the output layer parameters, detecting specific types of model updates, and efficiently obtaining full outputs from the model, among others. We find that current protections against these attacks may be insufficient, and that the more effective guards we consider either eliminate sanctioned API use cases (i.e., logit bias), or are expensive to implement (i.e., changing model architecture). Lastly, we argue that this “vulnerability” may be more of a feature than a bug; since we believe that the benefits for API clients outweigh any known harms to LLM providers.”” Alright, let me break down this very tech-heavy document into simpler terms. Imagine you have a super smart robot that can talk and write beautifully. This robot is very expensive and unique, so the company that made it doesn’t want to just give it away. Instead, they let people talk to the robot through a special phone line (this is what we call an API). However, they’re careful not to reveal how the robot actually creates its sentences, because that’s their secret recipe. Now, some smart researchers have found a way to figure out some of the secret ingredients of the robot’s recipe, just by talking to it through this phone line. They discovered that, even though the company tried to keep the recipe a secret, the way the robot speaks and writes has certain patterns. By carefully analyzing these patterns, the researchers could make educated guesses about parts of the secret recipe. Here’s how they did it: 1. Figuring out the robot’s thought size: One of the things they were able to guess is how big the robot’s “brain” is. Imagine the robot’s brain is made of boxes, and each box can hold a piece of information. The researchers found a way to count how many boxes there are, just by listening to the Error Something went wrong Connection errored out. Type an input and press Enter Hi there! Run Error Something went wrong Connection errored out. Status code from OpenAI server <Response [200]> Parameters ▼ Built with Gradiologo","completion":"box the robot talks. 2. Secret handshakes: They also figured out a kind of “secret handshake” that the robot uses when it’s talking. This handshake is a particular way the robot transforms its thoughts before speaking. The researchers found out they could mimic this handshake to reveal more about the robot’s thought process. 3. Spotting changes in the robot’s updates: Just like how your phone receives updates to get new features or fix bugs, this robot also gets updates. The researchers found a way to tell not only when the robot had been updated but also what kind of updates it got. It's a bit like recognizing your friend got a new haircut even if you weren't there at the barbershop. 4. Finding words the robot can’t say: Surprisingly, there are some words that, due to the way the robot is programmed, it just can’t say or finds very hard to say. The researchers learned how to find these words, shining a light on some limitations of the robot. 5. Making the robot talk cheaper: Normally, you need to make a lot of calls to the robot to get it to spill all its secrets at once, which can be expensive. The researchers came up with a smarter way to ask questions so that they can learn almost everything they want to know about the robot with fewer calls, thus saving money. The interesting part is that while the researchers showed it's possible to learn a lot about the robot without the company telling them, they also thought about how companies could prevent this from happening. They suggested a few ways, but also noted that some of the company's options might make the robot less useful or fun for everyone else. In conclusion, this research is about pushing the boundaries of what we can learn from sophisticated AI systems, like our talking robot, even when direct information about how they work is kept secret. It also opens discussions about transparency and security in the age of AI."},{"prompt":"Did the authors find out any interesting techincal things about the model , such as embedding size?","completion":"Yes, the authors of the study made several technical discoveries about the model they were investigating, particularly in terms of its embedding size. They were able to use their methods to estimate the embedding size of an API-protected large language model (LLM) like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo. Specifically, they estimated the embedding size of the model to be about 4,096. Embedding size is a critical parameter in language models, as it determines the dimensionality of the vectors used to represent words or tokens within the model. A larger embedding size can store more information about each token, potentially leading to more nuanced understanding and generation of text, but it also requires more computational resources. The authors' ability to infer this information is significant because embedding sizes are among the architectural details that typically aren't disclosed for proprietary models accessible only through APIs. By analyzing the model's outputs, they were able to deduce this aspect of its internal architecture, which is a testament to the sophistication of their analysis methods. This kind of insight can be valuable for understanding the capabilities and limitations of the model, as well as for academic research purposes where details of commercial models are often not made public."},{"prompt":"What are the implications of this research?","completion":"The research on extracting detailed information about API-protected large language models (LLMs) has several important implications across the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, ethics, and commercial AI applications. Here are some key implications: 1. **AI Transparency and Accountability**: By demonstrating that it is possible to glean significant information about proprietary AI models through their outputs, this research highlights considerations around transparency and accountability in the AI industry. It can lead to increased calls for AI developers to be more open about the structures of their models, thus improving the transparency of AI technologies. 2. **Security and Intellectual Property Concerns**: The capability to reverse-engineer or infer hidden architectural details of LLMs raises concerns about the security of proprietary information. Companies investing heavily in the development of these models might need to reassess their security measures to protect their intellectual property effectively. 3. **Ethical Use of AI**: This research could contribute to ongoing discussions about the ethical use of AI, particularly in understanding how models might be replicating or amplifying biases present in their training data. With tools to analyze models more deeply, researchers and ethicists could better identify and address these issues. 4. **Innovation in AI Development**: Understanding the limitations and characteristics of LLMs can spur innovation. For example, identifying softmax bottlenecks and other architectural inefficiencies can lead to the development of more efficient models that overcome these limitations. 5. **AI Regulations and Standards**: As it becomes apparent that AI models can be analyzed and potentially reverse-engineered through their outputs, regulators might step in to establish standards and guidelines for AI model protection, transparency, and ethical use. This can affect how AI technologies are developed, shared, and used across industries. 6. **Improved Model Debugging and Analysis Tools**: The techniques developed in this research can enhance tools available for debugging and analyzing LLMs. This can help model developers to better understand the behavior of their models, including detecting tokenization issues, understanding model updates, and improving model outputs. 7. **Advancements in AI Countermeasures**: On the flip side, understanding how information about models can be extracted may lead to the development of countermeasures to protect against unauthorized analysis. This might involve new model architectures or API features that obscure the details of the model's internal workings without compromising its utility. 8. **Community Engagement and Collaboration**: Sharing findings and techniques for analyzing LLMs can foster greater collaboration and engagement within the AI research community. It promotes an environment where knowledge is shared, potentially leading to faster advancements in AI technologies and methodologies. Overall, this research underscores the need for a balanced approach to AI development that considers the benefits of transparency and openness against the need to protect proprietary advancements and ensure ethical use of technology."},{"prompt":"用CR首字母来输出拼音越短越好","completion":"Cài Ròu"},{"prompt":"In the style of the \\"Discontinuity Guide\\" List the infuences on Blakes 7 ..","completion":"\\"Blake's 7\\" is a British science fiction television series created by Terry Nation that aired from 1978 to 1981.

This typically occurs when a function expects a larger dataset than what is being provided, or when there's an index misalignment somewhere. Technical Analysis (TA) indicators often require a certain number of data points (rows) to calculate their values accurately. For instance, calculating a 14-period moving average would require at least 14 data points. Similar or more complex calculations are performed when you use \`add_all_ta_features\` method from the \`ta\` (technical analysis) library in Python, which applies multiple TA indicators to your DataFrame. # Steps to Resolve: 1. **Check Dependencies and Documentation**: Ensure you are using the latest version of the \`ta\` library and understand the minimum data requirements for the indicators you're trying to compute. 2. **Data Size Check**: Before applying \`add_all_ta_features\`, ensure your dataset meets the minimum size required for the calculations. For many indicators, especially those involving moving averages or similarly calculated indicators, you may need significantly more data points than you have. 3. **Filling Missing Values**: You mentioned using \`fillna=True\`. This is good for handling missing values in your data, but if the dataset lacks the required length for certain calculations, filling missing values alone won't resolve index out-of-bounds errors. 4. **Incremental Approach**: Instead of adding all TA features at once, try adding them one by one or in smaller groups. This method can help you identify if a specific subset of features is causing the problem due to data size constraints. \`\`\`python import ta # Assuming df is your DataFrame and is already loaded with data df = ta.add_volume_ta(df, high=\\"High\\", low=\\"Low\\", close=\\"Close\\", volume=\\"volume_crypto\\", fillna=True) # Add more feature sets incrementally... \`\`\` 5. **Manual Calculation as a Last Resort**: If certain features are essential and you can't resolve the data size issue, consider manually calculating those features for your dataset. This approach, however, should be a last resort due to the complexity and maintenance issues it might introduce. 6. **Review Error Message Context**: Ensure the error genuinely originates from the \`add_all_ta_features\` method. Sometimes, errors can be misleading if there's a preceding operation on the DataFrame that's incorrectly altering its size or structure. 7. **Slice Dataframe**: If there are features you specifically need and are sure about the minimal data requirement, you can operate on a sliced portion of the DataFrame that meets the criteria for those indicators. 8. **Consult Documentation/Community**: If you're stuck, the GitHub repository issues section of the \`ta\` library or Stack Overflow could provide insight. Others might have faced similar issues. Considering everything, it's crucial to balance between having enough data for meaningful technical analysis and managing calculations' computational demands. If the dataset inherently lacks sufficient data points for certain indicators, it might be worth reevaluating which features are essential for your analysis to prevent misinterpretations."},{"prompt":"i used following code : df = ta.add_all_ta_features( df, open=\\"Open\\", high=\\"High\\", low=\\"Low\\", close=\\"Close\\", volume=\\"volume_crypto\\", fillna=True, vectorized=True) and code runned without error what does vectorized parameter do?","completion":"The \`vectorized\` parameter in the \`ta.add_all_ta_features\` method is designed to enhance the performance of the technical analysis feature calculations.

Vectorized operations leverage NumPy arrays or pandas Series for calculations, allowing for batch operations on entire arrays of data at once instead of computing each element one at a time through a loop. This method is generally much faster due to optimizations within NumPy and pandas, which are designed to efficiently handle array-based operations. The primary benefits of using \`vectorized=True\` include: 1. **Performance Improvement**: Since NumPy and pandas are optimized for vectorized operations, calculations can be completed much faster, making it a preferred option for large datasets. 2. **Efficiency**: Vectorized operations reduce the overhead of Python loops and enable more efficient use of CPU resources. 3. **Code Simplicity**: While the underlying operations might be complex, vectorized operations often lead to simpler and cleaner code.

Если рассматривать вопрос с точки зрения географии, культуры или природных ресурсов, Сахалин представляет собой важный регион с разнообразными аспектами. Однако, поскольку ваш вопрос может относиться к нескольким тематикам, включая географию, историю или даже культуру, я постараюсь ответить более детально на различные аспекты, связанные с Сахалином: # География и природа Сахалин — самый большой остров России, расположенный между Охотским морем на востоке и Японским морем на западе. Он отделяется от материковой части России Татарским проливом и соединён с ней Сахалинским мостом через пролив. Природа острова уникальна, здесь встречаются как тайговые леса, так и горные вершины. Климат острова умеренный муссонный. # История Сахалин имеет сложную историю, включая периоды, когда остров был предметом территориальных споров между Россией и Японией. В результате Русско-Японской войны 1904-1905 годов южная часть острова была передана Японии. После Второй мировой войны вся территория острова вернулась под контроль СССР, а сейчас он является частью Российской Федерации. # Экономика Экономика Сахалина тесно связана с добычей природных ресурсов, в основном нефти и природного газа, а также с рыболовством и лесозаготовкой.

Temel olarak, insan hakları, özgürlüğü ve bireysel tercihlerin ön planda olduğu demokratik toplum anlayışına ters düşen bu sistem, ayrıca bir dizi etik ve moral sorunu da beraberinde getirir. Sistemin temellerini inceleyecek olursak: 1. **Eugenics (İrsel Seçilim)**: İnsanlık tarihinde benzeri görülmüş bu yaklaşım, en \\"güçlü\\" genlere sahip bireylerin üreme yetkisine sahip olması gerektiğini savunur. Ancak bu, biyolojik çeşitliliğin zarar görmesine, belirli genetik özelliklerin tercih edilirken diğerlerinin yok sayılmasına ve tehlikeli bir üstünlük anlayışının oluşmasına sebep olabilir. 2. **Çocuk Yetiştirme**: Çocukların biyolojik ebeveynlerinden alınıp bir \\"insanlık ailesi\\" içinde yetiştirilmesi fikri, çocukların bireysel kimliklerini, aile bağlarını ve kültürel kökenlerini tanımalarını engelleyebilir. Ayrıca, bireylerin kendi çocuklarıyla kuracakları duygusal bağları yok saymak, hem ebeveynlerin hem de çocukların psikolojik sağlığını tehlikeye atabilir. 3. **Totaliter Yönetim**: Önerilen sistemde, üreme yetkisine kimin sahip olacağından, çocukların nasıl yetiştirileceğine, yeteneklerin nasıl test edileceğine kadar her konuda merkezi bir otoritenin sınırsız güce sahip olması gerektiği öne sürülüyor. Bu tür bir yönetim anlayışı, bireysel özgürlüklerin ve tercihlerin yok sayılmasına, aşırı denetim ve gözetim toplumu oluşturulmasına yol açar. 4. **Eşit Fırsat İlkesi**: Teoride, her bireyin eşit fırsatlara sahip olması ve yeteneklerinin tam olarak geliştirilmesi güzel bir amaç gibi görünse de, bu sistemin uygulamada adaletli ve etik bir şekilde yönetilmesi büyük bir zorluk teşkil eder. Ayrıca, insanların mutluluk ve tatmin duygularının sadece yeteneklerinin tanınması ve kullanılmasından gelmediğini unutmamak gerekir. Sonuç olarak, insanlık için daha adil ve sürdürülebilir bir medeniyet kurma arayışında, bireylerin özgürlüklerine, çeşitliliğe ve eşitlik ilkesine saygı gösteren, etik değerleri ve insan haklarını ön planda tutan yaklaşımların benimsenmesi gerekmektedir. Önerilen sistem, yukarıda belirtilen faktörlerin büyük bir kısmını göz ardı etmekte, bu nedenle de insanlık için ideal bir medeniyet modeli oluşturamamaktadır."},{"prompt":"Présenter des excuses à son directeur de mémoire pour le retard du dépôt de travail","completion":"Objet : Excuses pour le retard du dépôt de mon travail de mémoire Cher(e) [nom du directeur de mémoire], Je tiens par la présente à vous présenter mes plus sincères excuses pour le retard du dépôt de mon travail de mémoire.

I disagree with this view because I believe that we should try to help as many people as possible. On the one hand, I accept that it is important to help our neighbours and fellow citizens. In most communities there are people who are impoverished or disadvantaged in some way. It is possible to find homeless people, for example, in even the wealthiest of cities, and for those who are concerned about this problem, there are usually opportunities to volunteer time or give money to support these people. In the UK, people can help in a variety of ways, from donating clothing to serving free food in a soup kitchen. As the problems are on our doorstep, and there are obvious ways to help, I can understand why some people feel that we should prioritise local charity. At the same time, I believe that we have an obligation to help those who live beyond our national borders. In some countries the problems that people face are much more serious than those in our own communities, and it is often even easier to help. For example, when children are dying from curable diseases in African countries, governments and individuals in richer countries can save lives simply by paying for vaccines that already exist. A small donation to an international charity might have a much greater impact than helping in our local area. In conclusion, it is true that we cannot help everyone, but in my opinion national boundaries should not stop us from helping those who are in need.","completion":"作为一位雅思考官，我将依据雅思写作评分标准对您的文章进行评分。这些标准包括任务回应(Task Response)、连贯与衔接(Coherence and Cohesion)、词汇资源(Lexical Resource)、语法范围与准确性(Grammatical Range and Accuracy)。请注意，我的点评仅基于提供的内容，并不代表官方雅思评分。 任务回应(Task Response): 7 您的文章很好地回应了任务要求，提出了一个清晰的论点并支持了自己的观点。您通过对比本国援助与国际援助的效果，有效地展开了主题，并提出了合理的结论。但是，为了达到更高的得分，可以进一步加强论点的深度和细节，例如，通过讨论为什么一些人可能反对国际援助，并解释为什么这些观点不成立。 连贯与衔接(Coherence and Cohesion): 8 您的文章结构清晰，段落间的过渡自然流畅。明显的主题句和总结句帮助读者理解每个段落的主要观点。然而，为了进一步提升，可以尝试使用更多的衔接手段，比如同义词替换和复杂的连接词语，以增强文段之间的连接。 词汇资源(Lexical Resource): 7 您有很好的词汇量，能够使用一定范围的词语表达自己的观点。不过，尝试使用更为丰富和精确的词汇来表达特定的意思，可以帮助您获得更高的分数。 语法范围与准确性(Grammatical Range and Accuracy): 7 语法使用总体上准确，句型多样。不过，更加活用各种复杂句型可以提高您的得分。注意检查并避免任何可能的语法错误。 总分: 7.25 (请注意，雅思写作分数只有整数和半分，所以最终分数可能被调整为7或7.5。) 建议: - 深入发展您的论点，包括反对观点的考虑，可以提高任务回应得分。 - 使用更多的衔接手段增强文章的流畅性。 - 尝试使用更多准确且丰富的词汇来表达细微的差别。 - 联系使用更多复杂的语法结构以提升您的语法得分。 继续努力，希望我的反馈对你有所帮助！"},{"prompt":"gpt 4 or gpt3.5","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, there hasn't been an official release of a model explicitly named \\"GPT-4\\" by OpenAI. Therefore, I can give you some insights based on the predecessors of such a hypothetical model, focusing mainly on GPT-3 and what could be expected in an evolution like GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. # GPT-3 (Third Generation) - **Launch Date**: June 2020. - **Model Size**: 175 billion parameters. - **Capabilities**: High-quality text generation, deep understanding of context, ability to generate human-like text across a wide range of topics and formats, language translation, question-answering, and more. It demonstrated a significant leap in language model capabilities. - **Limitations**: Despite its capabilities, GPT-3 often produces outputs that could be biased, factually incorrect, or nonsensical. It also struggles with understanding and generating content based on very recent events or very specialized knowledge not well-represented in its training data. # GPT-3.5 This version would refer to an incremental improvement over GPT-3, not a completely new generation. The \\".5\\" designation (if we were to follow naming convention trends) suggests enhancements and optimizations over GPT-3 without being a revolutionary leap. Such improvements might include: - **Reduced Biases and Errors**: Better handling of biases and reduction in the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. - **Improved Contextual Understanding**: Enhancements in understanding context and maintaining coherency over longer stretches of text. - **Efficiency Improvements**: More optimized algorithms to run more efficiently, possibly requiring less computational resources for the same or improved level of task performance. - **Knowledge Updates**: Incremental updates to its corpus could allow it to be more aware of recent events or developments. # GPT-4 (Hypothetical) Given the trend of progress from GPT-2 to GPT-3, a hypothetical GPT-4 would likely embody a substantial leap in capabilities again, possibly including: - **Massive Increase in Parameters**: Far beyond the 175 billion of GPT-3, enhancing its depth of knowledge and understanding. - **Advanced Reasoning Capabilities**: Improved abilities to handle complex reasoning tasks, potentially making it more reliable for academic, professional, and research tasks. - **High Fidelity on More Niche Subjects**: Better representation and accuracy on lesser-known topics due to broader and deeper training data. - **Even Greater Efficiency**: Further optimizations to reduce compute costs and environmental impact without sacrificing performance. - **Enhanced Safety and Bias Reduction Features**: More sophisticated mechanisms to handle ethical, moral, and societal implications of AI-generated text.

This shift marked a significant change from the initial objectives of the occupation, which included democratizing Japan, dismantling its war potential, and laying the groundwork for a peaceful and stable country that would renounce military aggression. The Reverse Course, however, redirected these priorities towards rebuilding Japan as a bulwark against communism during the Cold War. The reasons for this strategic pivot and its consequences are complex and multifaceted. # Reasons for the Reverse Course 1. **Cold War Tensions:** The global geopolitical landscape was rapidly changing, with tensions mounting between the United States and the Soviet Union. As the Cold War intensified, U.S. policymakers began to view Japan not just as a defeated foe that needed to be demilitarized and democratized, but also as a potential ally and bastion against communist expansion in Asia. 2. **Communist Victories in Asia:** The victory of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and the onset of the Korean War in 1950 heightened fears of a domino effect of communist victories in Asia. Japan's strategic importance as an anti-communist platform in the region became even more pronounced. 3. **Economic Considerations:** There was a growing awareness of the need for a strong Japanese economy as a stabilizing force in the region. Economic distress could lead to political instability, which could, in turn, provide fertile ground for communist ideologies. Rebuilding Japan's economy became an essential countermeasure against this perceived threat. # Consequences of the Reverse Course 1. **Political and Economic Rehabilitation:** Japan's political and economic systems were rehabilitated with American assistance. The focus shifted towards economic recovery, leading to significant economic aid and investment. This support laid the groundwork for Japan's rapid economic growth in the decades that followed, eventually transforming it into one of the world's leading economies. 2. **Redirection of Reform Efforts:** Initial reforms aimed at purging Japan of militarism and ultra-nationalism were scaled back. The zaibatsu (large industrial and financial business conglomerates) disbandment policies were relaxed, and some political and industrial figures who had been purged were allowed back into public life. This helped in stabilizing the political landscape but also meant the retention of some pre-war power structures. 3. **Security Arrangements:** The Reverse Course facilitated the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951 and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which came into effect in 1952, formally ending the occupation. These agreements allowed the United States to maintain military bases in Japan, ensuring a continued American military presence in Asia and embedding Japan in the Western security framework against the Soviet Union and communism. 4. **Impact on Japanese Society:** While the Reverse Course helped in stabilizing Japan and setting it on a path of economic prosperity, it also led to a complicated legacy regarding the wartime past and post-war pacifism. The decision not to prosecute certain war criminals and the rehabilitation of some pre-war elites have had a lasting impact on Japanese politics and society. In conclusion, the adoption of the Reverse Course was driven by strategic considerations linked to the emerging Cold War context. Its consequences have been profound, both in terms of Japan's place in the international order and its post-war development trajectory. It marked Japan's transition from a defeated nation to a key ally of the United States in Asia, setting the stage for its post-war recovery and economic miracle."},{"prompt":"Olá","completion":"Olá!

These kinds of laws can create natural experiments where a regression discontinuity design (RDD) can be effectively employed to study the causal effects of these laws. RDD is a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design that attempts to mimic random assignment using a cutoff point around which the assignment to the treatment condition is discontinuous. Here are some examples of situations where RDD could be used in the Italian context: 1. **Municipal Merger Policies:** Italy has undergone several waves of municipal mergers (fusioni di comuni), aiming to reduce the number of municipalities and increase efficiency. These policies often use population thresholds to determine eligibility for merger incentives or requirements. For instance, municipalities with populations just below and just above the threshold can be compared using RDD to assess the policy's impact on local governance, public services efficiency, or economic outcomes. 2. **Financial Aid and Subsidies:** The Italian government provides financial aid and subsidies to municipalities based on various criteria, such as economic distress, population size, or geographic location (e.g., mountain communities). Laws establishing financial thresholds for eligibility create a discontinuity that can be explored through RDD to evaluate the impact of financial support on local economies, infrastructure development, or public welfare. 3. **School Funding and Programs:** Legislation regarding education often involves specific criteria for providing additional resources or implementing new programs in schools. For example, thresholds based on the number of students or the socioeconomic status of a municipality could determine eligibility for additional funding or programs. RDD could be applied to assess the effects of these initiatives on educational outcomes. 4. **Cultural and Environmental Funding:** Italy often allocates funding for cultural preservation and environmental protection to municipalities based on certain criteria, like being part of the UNESCO heritage list or having particular environmental characteristics (e.g., protected areas). Laws that establish eligibility thresholds provide opportunities for RDD studies to examine the consequences of such funding on cultural preservation, tourism, or environmental outcomes. 5. **Healthcare Services:** Policies related to the provision of healthcare services sometimes target municipalities based on population thresholds or health indicators. For instance, the establishment of new healthcare facilities or allocation of healthcare professionals might depend on these criteria. Researchers can use RDD to evaluate the impact of these policies on health outcomes, access to care, or patient satisfaction. In each of these examples, the key to employing RDD is the presence of a clear cutoff or threshold that divides municipalities into those just eligible for a legal provision and those just ineligible. This design allows researchers to attribute observed differences in outcomes to the policy intervention rather than other factors, providing insights into the effectiveness of such laws."},{"prompt":"Ты технический писатель.

Использование ya gen-config junk/{USER}/ya.conf генерирует пользовательский конфигурационный файл с описанием и закомментированными опциями по умолчанию (если у вас уже не было настроенной конфигурации) с сохранением ранее заданных параметров для актуальных ключей. Если эту конфигурацию положить в пользовательский junk с именем ya.conf, то он будет использоваться для определения опций ya. Значения, указанные в ya.conf — самые слабые и переопределяются соответствующими переменными окружения или аргументами командной строки. Если у вас нет junk, то конфигурацию можно сохранить в ~/.ya/ya.conf. Формат ya.conf должен быть представлен в виде toml файла. Для опций без параметров следует указывать true в качестве значения. Для опций \\"словарей\\" (например flags), следует открывать одноимённую секцию (таблицу), где дальше будут следовать записи в формате key = \\"val\\". Например: [flags] NO_DEBUGINFO = \\"yes\\" Порядок применения опций Места возможных расположений файла с опциями ya (каждый последующий может переопределять поля предыдущего): arcadia/ya.conf arcadia/junk/{USER}/ya.conf arcadia/../ya.conf (если вы хотите иметь разный конфиг для разных репозиториев) ~/.ya/ya.conf переменные окружения аргументы командной строки Так же есть возможность менять имя ya.conf (каждый последующий может переопределять поля предыдущего): ya.conf (сначала обрабатывается файл из корня аркадии, потом из junk, ...) ya.{system}.conf ya.{command}.conf Модификаторы {command} и {system} влияют на то, из какой подкомманды (handler) и на какой системе (windows, linux, darwin, java, unknown) будет применяется данный файл конфигурации. То есть, например, чтобы конфигурация применялась для хэндлера make на платформе darwin достаточно создать в одном из удобных мест файл с названием, например, ya.make.darwin.conf. Опции для конкретных команд ya Если одна и та же опция используется в нескольких хендлерах и вам нужны, в зависимости от хендлера, разные значения, можно точно указать нужный хендлер и переопределить опции только для него. Например: project_output = \\"/default/path\\" [ide.qt] project_output = \\"/path/to/qt/project\\" [ide.msvs] project_output = \\"c:pathtomsvsproject\\" Таким образом ya ide qt и ya ide msvs будут иметь разные пути до проекта, отличные от значения по умолчанию. Пример с переопределением словарной опции flags только для хендлера ya dump json-test-list [flags] NO_DEBUGINFO = \\"yes\\" [dump.json-test-list.flags] MY_SPECIAL_FLAG = \\"yes\\" Вызов ya dump json-test-list в этом случае будет эквивалентен ya dump json-test-list -DMY_SPECIAL_FLAG=\\"yes\\", NO_DEBUGINFO не будет использоваться. Подстановка переменных окружения Строковые ключи могут указывать переменные окружения в формате {ENV_VAR}, которые будут подменяться после загрузки конфигов. Дополнительно резолвится переменная окружения YA_ARCADIA_ROOT, которая указывает на Аркадию, из которой работает ya. Например: output_root = \\"{YA_ARCADIA_ROOT}/../out\\" Изменение цветовой схемы ya по умолчанию Для колоризации ya использует внутри текста свои маркеры, которые при выводе на терминал изменяют цвет последующего текста: alt1 = \\"cyan\\" alt2 = \\"magenta\\" alt3 = \\"light-blue\\" bad = \\"red\\" good = \\"green\\" imp = \\"light-default\\" path = \\"yellow\\" unimp = \\"dark-default\\" warn = \\"yellow\\" Значения по умолчанию можно изменить с помощью секции terminal_profile в конфиге, например: [terminal_profile] bad = \\"light-red\\" unimp = \\"default\\" Добавление целевых платформ Подробнее про платформы можно найти в документации по ya make. Подробнее о том, как добавить целевые плафтормы через командную строку. Чтобы добавить интересующие целевые платформы, достаточно несколько раз описать следующую конструкцию: [[target_platform]] platform_name = \\"default-darwin-arm64\\" build_type = \\"relwithdebinfo\\" [target_platform.flags] ANY_FLAG = \\"flag_value\\" ANY_OTHER_FLAG = \\"flag_value\\" На каждый параметр командной строки --target-platform-smth существует аналогичный ключ для файла конфигурации. Описание дополнительных опций (alias) Если есть необходимость постоянно задавать одни и те же аргументы, их можно объединить в alias. Для описания alias-ов используется синтаксис toml Array of Tables. Пример: --add-go-result Например, если нужно добавить симлинки на сгенерированные go файлы, приходится писать что-то подобное: ya make path/to/project --replace-result --add-result=.go --no-output-for=.cgo1.go --no-output-for=.res.go --no-output-for=_cgo_gotypes.go --no-output-for=_cgo_import.go В качестве решения можно записать всё в файл junk/<username>/ya.make.conf следующие строки: # junk/<username>/ya.make.conf replace_result = true # --replace-result add_result_extend = [\\".go\\"] # --add-result=.go suppress_outputs = [\\".cgo1\\", \\".res.go\\", \\"_cgo_gotypes.go\\"] # ----no-output-for=.cgo1.go --no-output-for=.res.go --no-output-for=_cgo_gotypes.go В таком случае значения будут применяться всегда (при всех запусках ya make для пользователя <username>). Если же необходимо иметь возможность включать данное поведение, можно использовать технологию alias-ов: # junk/<username>/ya.conf # ^ alias will be available only for user <username> # ^ in any handler [[alias]] # define new alias # Any keys, available in ya.conf replace_result = true add_result_extend = [\\".go\\"] suppress_outputs = [\\".cgo1\\", \\".res.go\\", \\"_cgo_gotypes.go\\"] [alias._settings.arg] # define argument for this alias names = [\\"--add-go-result\\"] # define only long name help = \\"Add generated .go files\\" # define help string visible = true # make this argument visible in \`ya make --help\` Теперь флаг --add-go-result виден в выводе ya make --help, и мы можем сократить команду до: ya make path/to/project --add-go-result Пример: отключение предпостроенных тулов Чтобы отключить использование предпостроенных тулов, нужно запускать ya со следующими аргументами: ya make path/to/project -DUSE_PREBUILT_TOOLS=no --host-platform-flag=USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS=no Сначала опишем желаемое поведение в ya.conf: [host_platform_flags] USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS = \\"no\\" [flags] USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS = \\"no\\" Теперь опишем alias, который будет включаться по аргументу, переменной окружения или выставлением значения в любом ya.conf: [[alias]] [alias.host_platform_flags] # host_platform_flags is subkey for alias USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS = \\"no\\" [alias.flags] # flags is subkey for alias USE_PREBUILT_TOOLS = \\"no\\" [alias._settings.arg] # define argument names = [\\"-p\\", \\"--disable-prebild-tools\\"] # define short and long name help = \\"Disable prebuild tools\\" visible = true [alias._settings.env] # define environment value name = \\"YA_DISABLE_PREBUILD_TOOLS\\" [alias._settings.conf] # define config key name = \\"disable_prebuild_tools\\" Теперь, чтобы активировать это поведение, можно воспользоваться следующими способами: # Long argument ya make path/to/project --disable-prebuild-tools # Short argument ya make path/to/project -p # Env YA_DISABLE_PREBUILD_TOOLS=yes ya make path/to/project # Config value echo \\"ndisable_prebuild_tools=truen\\" >> junk/USER/ya.conf ya make path/to/project Несколько alias-ов Можно создавать любое количество alias-ов внутри одного файла. Alias-ы из разных файлов не перезаписывают друг друга. Задавать описанную переменную в блоке [alias._settings.conf] можно в любом файле, в любом месте, так как создание alias-ов происходит до применения значений из файлов конфигурации. # path/to/first/ya.conf some_values = true third_alias = true [[alias]] # ... [alias._settings.conf] name = \\"first_alias\\" [[alias]] # ... # path/to/second/ya.conf some_other_values = true [[alias]] # ... [alias._settings.conf] name = \\"third_alias\\" [[alias]] first_alias = true # ... Пример с target_platform [[alias]] [[alias.target_platform]] # --target-platform platfom_name = \\"...\\" build_type = \\"debug\\" # --target-platform-debug run_tests = true # --target-platform-tests target_platform_compiler = \\"c_compiler\\" # --target-platform-c-compiler # ... [alias.target_platform.flags] # --target-platform-flag FLAG = true OTHER_FLAG = \\"other_value\\" [alias._settings.arg] # Create argument consumer for alias names = [\\"-a\\", \\"--my-cool-alias\\"] # Short and long name help = \\"This alias are awesome! It really helps me\\" # Help string visible = true # make it visible in \`ya make --help\` [alias._settings.env] # Create environment consumer for alias, must starts with YA name = \\"YA_MY_COOL_ALIAS\\" [alias._settings.conf] # Create config consumer for alias, can be enabled from any config-file name = \\"my_cool_alias\\" Семантика alias Внутри одного блока [[alias]] можно задавать произвольное количество опций и под-опций. Для создания аргумента или переменной окружения нужно описать их в ключах [alias._settings.arg] и [alias._settings.env], как показано в примере. После этого они станут доступными во всех подкомандах ya. Для создания опции, которая будет существовать только в конкретном handler-е (например make), достаточно дописать между ключами alias и settings произвольный префикс: [alias.make._settings.args] — будет работать только в ya make ... [alias.ide.idea._settings.args] — будет работать только в ya ide idea ... При заполнении ключа [alias._settings.conf] создаётся опция, которую можно явно включить в любом конфигурационном файле (даже в том, который применился раньше — поиск и обработка alias-ов происходит до применения значений). Более того, появляется возможность применять один alias внутри другого, обеспечивая таким образом простейшую композицию. Композиция Если возникла необходимость вынести общую часть из alias-ов, можно воспользоваться композицией. Пусть у нас есть два alias-а: [[alias]] first_value = 1 second_value = 2 [[alias._settings.arg]] names = [\\"--first\\"] [[alias]] second_value = 2 third_value = 3 [[alias._settings.arg]] names = [\\"--second\\"] Чтобы вынести общую часть, нужно создать новый alias c параметром конфигурации: [[alias]] second_value = 2 [[alias._settings.conf]] name = \\"common_alias\\" [[alias]] first_value = 1 common_alias = true # Call alias [[alias._settings.arg]] names = [\\"--first\\"] [[alias]] common_alias = true # Call alias third_value = 3 [[alias._settings.arg]] names = [\\"--second\\"] Теперь, при вызове ya <handler> --second применится alias common_alias, и выставится значение для third_value. Особенности: Можно вызывать несколько alias-ов внутри другого alias-а Глубина «вложенности» может быть любой Есть защита от циклов Можно использовать alias, объявленный позже места использования или находящийся в другом файле \\" Напиши документацию по этой команде","completion":"# Документация команды ya gen-config Обзор Команда \`ya gen-config\` предназначена для генерации конфигурационного файла для инструмента \`ya\`, который используется в рамках репозитория Arcadia для автоматизации различных задач разработки, сборки и тестирования.

Bu, doğal sevgi ve aile bağlarını zayıflatır ve insanî duyguları mekanik bir sürece indirger. 3. **Kolektif Çocuk Yetiştirme:** Çocukların bireysel aile yerine tüm insanlık tarafından yetiştirilmesi fikri, çocukların psikolojik gelişimi üzerinde ciddi etkiler yaratabilir. Aile bağlarının ve bireyin kendi köklerine duyduğu aidiyet hissinin önemi, çocuğun duygusal ve sosyal gelişimi açısından hayati önem taşır. 4. **Yetenek Testleri ve Eğitim:** Her çocuğun yeteneklerine göre yönlendirildiği bir eğitim sistemi kulağa cazip gelebilir fakat bu, erken yaşlardaki çocukların baskı altında tutulması ve belirli bir kalıba sokulmaya çalışılması anlamına gelir. Ayrıca, çocukların kendi ilgi alanlarını ve tutkularını özgürce keşfetme şansını da kısıtlar.

Abbiamo un esperimento aleatorio che si svolge in due fasi: 1. Lanciamo una moneta equilibrata. Ci sono due possibili esiti, Testa (T) o Croce (C), ciascuno con probabilità 0.5. 2. A seconda dell'esito del primo lancio: - Se esce Testa (T), lanciamo una seconda moneta che ha probabilità (alpha) di mostrare testa. - Se esce Croce (C), lanciamo una seconda moneta che ha probabilità (1 - alpha) di mostrare testa. Vogliamo determinare la legge congiunta delle variabili aleatorie coinvolte, che possiamo denominare (X_1) per il primo lancio e (X_2) per il secondo lancio, dove (X_1 = 1) se il primo lancio dà testa e (X_1 = 0) se dà croce, e (X_2 = 1) se il secondo lancio dà testa e (X_2 = 0) se dà croce. Notiamo che le possibili combinazioni di esiti per (X_1) e (X_2) sono quattro: TT, TC, CT, CC, dove la prima lettera rappresenta l'esito del primo lancio e la seconda quello del secondo lancio. Le probabilità congiunte per ogni coppia di esiti sono le seguenti: 1. **Probabilità che (X_1 = 1) e (X_2 = 1)** (TT, il primo lancio dà testa e il secondo lancio, con (alpha) probabilità di testa, dà anch'esso testa): (P(X_1 = 1, X_2 = 1) = 0.5 times alpha) 2. **Probabilità che (X_1 = 1) e (X_2 = 0)** (TC, il primo lancio dà testa e il secondo lancio, con (alpha) probabilità di testa, dà croce): (P(X_1 = 1, X_2 = 0) = 0.5 times (1 - alpha)) 3. **Probabilità che (X_1 = 0) e (X_2 = 1)** (CT, il primo lancio dà croce e il secondo lancio, con (1 - alpha) probabilità di testa, dà testa): (P(X_1 = 0, X_2 = 1) = 0.5 times (1 - alpha)) 4. **Probabilità che (X_1 = 0) e (X_2 = 0)** (CC, il primo lancio dà croce e il secondo lancio, con (1 - alpha) probabilità di testa, dà croce): (P(X_1 = 0, X_2 = 0) = 0.5 times alpha) Queste probabilità congiunte definiscono completamente la legge congiunta delle variabili (X_1) e (X_2).

Ecco i passaggi spiegati più dettagliatamente: # Fase 1: Considera il Primo Lancio di Moneta Nel primo lancio, la moneta è equilibrata, quindi hai una probabilità del 50% (o 0.5) di ottenere Testa (T) e la stessa probabilità di ottenere Croce (C). # Fase 2: Successivi Risultati Basati sul Primo Lancio - **Se esce Testa (T)**: la moneta successiva ha una probabilità (alpha) di mostrare Testa. Si può pensare come \\"se il primo evento accade (T), allora la probabilità del secondo evento (T di nuovo) è (alpha)\\". - **Se esce Croce (C)**: la moneta successiva ha una probabilità (1 - alpha) di mostrare Testa. In questo scenario, si ragiona allo stesso modo, ma con la probabilità modificata a (1 - alpha). # Calcolo delle Probabilità Congiunte Per capire la legge congiunta, consideriamo ogni coppia di risultati possibili per (X_1) e (X_2), dove (X_1) denota l'esito del primo lancio e (X_2) quello del secondo. Le probabilità congiunte derivano dalle combinazioni degli esiti di questi lanci. 1. **Per (X_1 = 1) e (X_2 = 1) (TT):** - La probabilità di ottenere Testa al primo lancio è 0.5. - Dato che il primo lancio ha dato Testa, la probabilità di ottenere Testa al secondo lancio è (alpha). - Moltiplicando le due probabilità (perché vogliamo che entrambi gli eventi accadano insieme, il che implica indipendenza tra la scelta del secondo lancio e l'esito del primo), otteniamo (0.5 times alpha). 2. **Per (X_1 = 1) e (X_2 = 0) (TC):** - Il primo lancio dà Testa con probabilità 0.5. - Dato Testa al primo lancio, la probabilità che il secondo lancio dia Croce (dato che abbiamo (alpha) per Testa, allora è (1 - alpha) per Croce). - Quindi, la probabilità congiunta è (0.5 times (1 - alpha)). 3. **Per (X_1 = 0) e (X_2 = 1) (CT):** - Il primo lancio dà Croce con probabilità 0.5. - Se esce Croce, il secondo lancio ha una probabilità di (1 - alpha) di mostrare Testa. - La combinazione di questi eventi dà una probabilità congiunta di (0.5 times (1 - alpha)). 4. **Per (X_1 = 0) e (X_2 = 0) (CC):** - Con Croce al primo lancio con probabilità 0.5, e poi avendo una probabilità (1 - alpha) per ottenere Testa al secondo lancio, la probabilità di ottenere Croce al secondo lancio è (alpha) (perché se il secondo lancio ha (1 - alpha) probabilità di Testa, c'è un (alpha) di probabilità di Croce in questo scenario). - Così, moltiplicando, otteniamo una probabilità congiunta di (0.5 times alpha). Questi calcoli mostrano come le probabilità di diversi esiti del secondo lancio dipendano dall'esito del primo lancio, determinando così la struttura delle proprie probabilità congiunte nell'esperimento."},{"prompt":"в TensorFlow есть встроенный набор данных под названием “cats_vs_dogs”.

Some people think that the main environmental problem is the loss of species as opposed to other environmental problem such as greenhouse effect. While the loss of species have severe impacts to our environment, I believe that the greenhouse effect are more critical. It is a truth that the loss of particular species of plants and animals would have bad impact to our environment. A typical harm of species loss is its impact to the whole eco-circle. A simple specie could have very important role in the eco-circle, and if it has been extinct, there will have a space in the whole circle. Which could let other specie extinct. For example, the bee can help the flower reproduce, if they extinct flower will be impact a lot. On the other hand, there are several reasons why I would believe that the greenhouse effect is the most important environmental problem. Firstly, the greenhouse effect cloud lead to the sea level rise which have the huge impact to the people who is live around the sea. They have the risk of lost their home and wealth. Secondly, the rising of temperature could lead to more bad weather issues. Although the average temperature only increases 1 centigrade, there will appear a lot of bad weather in everywhere. Finally, the greenhouse effect could have bad influence on human’s body health, which could lead to heart and blood problems.

While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university. The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career. On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete. For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.","completion":"Your IELTS essay demonstrates a strong command of the subject, appropriate structure, and clear arguments, as guided by the IELTS Writing Assessment criteria: Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy.

Araştırmalar, aile bağlarının çocukların duygusal ve sosyal gelişimi üzerinde önemli bir etki yarattığını göstermektedir. 4. **Yetenek Testleri ve Eğitim:** Her çocuğun yeteneklerini belirlemek ve geliştirmek amacıyla adil ve kapsamlı testler yapılması, özünde cazip bir fikir olabilir. Ancak, bu testlerin uygulaması, belirleyicisi ve yorumlayıcısı kim olacağı büyük sorular doğurur. Yetenek testleri ve sonuçları üzerinden yönlendirilen bir toplumda, bireylerin özsel değerlerinin ve benzersiz kişiliklerinin göz ardı edilmesi riski de bulunur. Bu senaryo, idealize edilmiş bir eşitlik ve adalet vizyonu sunarken, insan özgürlüğü, bireysellik ve çeşitliliği korumanın da önemini hatırlatıyor. Tarih boyunca, utopik toplum tasarımları genellikle distopik sonuçlar doğurmuştur. İnsanlığın ilerlemesi, çeşitliliği kutlamak, eşitliği ve adaleti teşvik etmek, ancak bireylerin özgürlüklerini ve özgünlüklerini de korumak gerektiğine dair dengeli bir anlayış gerektirir."},{"prompt":"aslında yukarıdaki ilke aşağıdaki şiirin merkez ve omurgasıdır: şimdi de ilk soru ve cevabı da dikkate alarak bir bütün olarak bu şiirin tamamını bir insanlık projesi olarak analiz et: bu satırlardaki ilkelerle nasıl bir medeniyet inşa edebilirdik: öleceksiniz, demiş tanrı: ölmeden mezarlara mı girelim? her an'ımızı korkuyla mı geçirelim? hayır, biz ölümsüzlüğü arayacağız atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde hayır, biz hayatın tadına varacağız kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde gün doğumunda ve gün batımında hayranlık içinde seyredeceğiz doğayı şarkılar söyleyip dans edeceğiz çırılçıplak, ne utanma ne çekince engellilerin yüzlerine öpücükler konduracak güzeller yakışıklılar salıncaklarda sallayacak neşeli çocuklar sarhoş şairleri cenneti büyütüp cehennemi küçülteceğiz bu evrende aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği öyle ki gerçekleştirsinler özgürce kendilerini olimpiyat ruhu kuşatmalı her alandaki rekabeti ödül de ceza da adalet de ölümden önce gelmeli tanrının boyunduruğunda sonsuz bir hayat değil tanrısız tek bir nefes isteriz, desin insanlık.","completion":"Bu şiirin merkezine konan ilke ve önerilen insanlık projesinin analizi, oldukça radikal bir medeniyet vizyonunu ortaya koyuyor. Vurgulanan özgürlük, eşitlik, özgerçekleşme, ve insanın tabiatıyla barışık yaşamasını hedefleyen bu vizyon, mevcut toplumsal, ekonomik ve siyasal yapıları köklü bir şekilde sorgulayarak, insanlığın yaşam biçimini dönüştürmeyi amaçlıyor. Bu medeniyet, aşağıdaki temel ilkelerle inşa edilebilir: 1. **Ölümsüzlük Arayışı:** Atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde ölümsüzlüğü arama fikri, bilim ve teknolojiye derin bir ilgi ve bu alanlarda insani çabalara büyük yatırımlar yapılmasını gerektiriyor. Burada, insanlık var oluşun sırlarını çözmeye ve yaşamın süresini uzatmaya, belki de ölümü aşmaya yönelik bir arayış içinde. 2. **Hayatın Tadını Çıkarma:** Kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde hayatın tadına varma çağrısı, kültürel ve cinsel özgürlüklere büyük bir önem verilmesini öneriyor. Bilgiye susamışlık ve fiziksel zevklerin kucaklanması, bu medeniyetin düşüncede ve bedende özgürlüğü benimsediğini gösteriyor. 3. **Toplumsal Eşitlik ve Destek:** Engelliler, çocuklar, ve hatta sarhoş şairlerin toplum içinde özel bir yeri ve saygınlığı olacağı belirtiliyor. Herkesin birbirine destek olduğu, empatinin ve toplumsal dayanışmanın öne çıktığı bir toplum yapısı öneriliyor. 4. **Cennet ve Cehennemi Yeniden Tanımlama:** Bu evrende cenneti büyütme ve cehennemi küçültme amacı, bireylerin yaptıklarının sonuçlarıyla yüzleştiği, dengeli bir adalet sistemi oluşmasını sağlayabilir. Dolayısıyla, bu sistemdeki \\"ödül\\", \\"ceza\\", ve \\"adalet\\" kavramları insani değerlere ve bireysel eylemlerin sonuçlarına göre şekillendirilir. 5. **Özgürlüğün Yüceltilmesi:** Şiir, tanrısız bir nefesi tercih etmeyi savunurken, bu, insanın kendi kaderini belirleme gücüne ve özgürlüğüne duyulan derin bir inancı ifade ediyor. Spiritüel ve dinî boyunduruklar yerine, bireysel özgürlük ve özgerçekleşmenin öncelikli olduğu bir toplum düzeni öngörülüyor. Toplumun yeniden örgütlenmesi, rekabetin olimpiyat ruhu ile kuşatılması, ve herkes için adaletin temin edilmesi gerekliliği üzerine kurulu bu medeniyet, insan onurunu ve potansiyelini maksimize etmeyi, aynı zamanda her bireyin özgürlüğünü ve fırsat eşitliğini korumayı amaçlıyor. Ancak bu vizyonun gerçekleşebilmesi için, mevcut sosyal, ekonomik ve politik sistemlerin radikal bir değişimden geçmesi gerektiğini de unutmamak gerekir. Bu tip bir değişim, büyük ölçüde farkındalık, eğitim ve kültürel dönüşüm gerektirecek ve muhtemelen uzun bir zaman alacaktır."},{"prompt":"{SNOW BIOME - TERRARIA} Mechanic: \\"Honestly...I don't know about that Archmage guy.

0:7:49.380 --> 0:7:52.720 Hanna Chai To change the email message. 0:7:55.100 --> 0:8:5.270 Hanna Chai So we can go to our branding and then choose email template and then find our template for block account email. 0:8:5.690 --> 0:8:33.570 Hanna Chai So we can configure our center and then the subject of the email and what's the redirect tool URL and then, uh, how long does the URL lifetime is and the default one is ohh 5 days and then I will message can be configured in the HTML tablet. 0:8:35.520 --> 0:8:35.920 Hanna Chai And then. 0:8:37.880 --> 0:8:40.840 Hanna Chai This is the error message customization. 0:8:43.520 --> 0:8:56.990 Hanna Chai So we can configure also under branding here and then custom text we will find the user block message and then we can modify from here and then this is the. 0:8:57.330 --> 0:8:59.960 Hanna Chai And error message will show. 0:9:2.750 --> 0:9:4.380 Hanna Chai So that's all for this. 0:9:4.430 --> 0:9:5.220 Hanna Chai Any question? 0:9:6.890 --> 0:9:8.640 Duraid Wadie Yeah, I have a few questions. 0:9:8.650 --> 0:9:9.620 Duraid Wadie I'm thank you for that. 0:9:10.310 --> 0:9:12.80 Duraid Wadie Does this user lockout? 0:9:12.170 --> 0:9:21.210 Duraid Wadie Is it comfortable ad you know or we really call it a customer level or is that completely at that full tenant level? 0:9:24.860 --> 0:9:26.740 Hanna Chai This one is under tenant level. 0:9:28.60 --> 0:9:28.670 Duraid Wadie OK. 0:9:29.40 --> 0:9:29.310 Hanna Chai Umm. 0:9:28.680 --> 0:9:33.180 Duraid Wadie And I guess you guys haven't tried the organization unit yet, right? 0:9:33.420 --> 0:9:34.530 Hanna Chai Yeah, I haven't tried. 0:9:35.450 --> 0:9:36.100 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:9:36.110 --> 0:9:41.910 Duraid Wadie I mean the same thing when you're gonna get to the, you know, password complexity and all of that, it'll be good if you check it. 0:9:41.920 --> 0:9:44.530 Duraid Wadie If it's possible to do this at the organization level. 0:9:45.900 --> 0:9:47.30 Hanna Chai Hmm, OK. 0:9:47.540 --> 0:9:48.210 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:9:48.260 --> 0:9:49.30 Duraid Wadie Thank you for that. 0:9:49.820 --> 0:9:51.70 Duraid Wadie Do you know is there is an option? 0:9:51.80 --> 0:10:0.480 Duraid Wadie Let's say I can keep on the wrong password, but instead of actually lock it out, actually we call them delay logging in. 0:10:0.750 --> 0:10:6.320 Duraid Wadie Let's say you won't be able to turn another password for another minute, then another 5 minutes, then another 10 minute. 0:10:6.330 --> 0:10:7.780 Duraid Wadie Did you see any option like that? 0:10:8.30 --> 0:10:8.370 Duraid Wadie Or not. 0:10:9.160 --> 0:10:9.470 Duraid Wadie No. 0:10:9.480 --> 0:10:9.950 Duraid Wadie OK. 0:10:10.40 --> 0:10:10.220 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:10:8.50 --> 0:10:11.470 Hanna Chai No, no, no such thing in Auth0, yeah. 0:10:11.770 --> 0:10:12.780 Duraid Wadie Yeah, that's perfect. 0:10:12.790 --> 0:10:13.290 Duraid Wadie Thank you for that. 0:10:13.960 --> 0:10:14.400 Hanna Chai OK. 0:10:14.470 --> 0:10:15.120 Hanna Chai Thank you. 0:10:15.130 --> 0:10:16.950 Hanna Chai Then I passed to Ping Ping. 0:10:18.950 --> 0:10:20.470 Ping Ping Lau He can I share my screen. 0:10:23.70 --> 0:10:24.230 Ping Ping Lau You can see my screen right? 0:10:25.630 --> 0:10:25.960 Duraid Wadie Yet. 0:10:25.420 --> 0:10:32.230 Ping Ping Lau So uh, the first one, I will go to will be on the change log integration for all zero. 0:10:32.420 --> 0:11:3.950 Ping Ping Lau So before I go to include details a a few points that I would like to highlight here is off 0 already have built-in integration with Amazon Event page where we can actually configure to stream the locks of that be for all the events that's happening and then stream it to event bridge and then off 0 strip configure at the tenant level so it applies to all activities happening on that tenants and the Lambda and Amazon Lambda. 0:11:3.960 --> 0:11:12.730 Ping Ping Lau Also we can see that it's already have built-in integration with event Bridge for off 0 itself later on in the screen you can see that we don't have to like bigger. 0:11:12.740 --> 0:11:20.630 Ping Ping Lau Mainly we can just select that the partner is also zero and for Lambda also is integrated with event bridge. 0:11:20.630 --> 0:11:32.610 Ping Ping Lau We can configure to say the trigger the Lambda when something received from the bridge and also since this is tidy, uh tidy coupled, right? 0:11:32.620 --> 0:11:47.890 Ping Ping Lau So if if they say we have set up the the screen or event bridge, if it delete the screen in off 0 then it will also automatically delete the the the resources in event Amazon Event Bridge asset. 0:11:47.940 --> 0:11:53.900 Ping Ping Lau Additional things that we put in like Lambda those will be will not get deleted. 0:11:55.720 --> 0:12:4.670 Ping Ping Lau So apart from integrating with event bridge or 10H also support multiple integration with other external tools. 0:12:4.680 --> 0:12:11.820 Ping Ping Lau But then I have only tested with a event page because I think it's already meeting our purpose here. 0:12:12.920 --> 0:12:21.790 Ping Ping Lau So, uh, with all these features that we have, this will be what I post and then so make it work with the change in integration. 0:12:22.200 --> 0:12:23.990 Ping Ping Lau So what? 0:12:24.220 --> 0:12:37.910 Ping Ping Lau In this what I've done is assuming that platform services will be populating those tenant ID and product instance ID into a Dynamo DB during the for that registration. 0:12:38.440 --> 0:13:1.160 Ping Ping Lau Then on Auth0 we configure the monitoring so that it's been the locks to AWS Event bridge and when event which I received the data it triggers the number of functions and the Lambda functions will be writing to the NSK where change of service will be consuming from the NSK. 0:13:3.120 --> 0:13:22.210 Ping Ping Lau So, uh, these are a few configuration I think I don't have to go through into details, but I'm just to show that it's already a the integrated service that we can select and then we also allowed to choose what type of events that we want to stream over. 0:13:23.280 --> 0:13:29.130 Ping Ping Lau Uh, they are quite a long list of events that we can capture in the Auth0. 0:13:29.180 --> 0:13:33.130 Ping Ping Lau So yeah, the good news is we can also catch a lot out. 0:13:33.420 --> 0:13:42.810 Ping Ping Lau So I think we can capture that nearly when we are doing coordinator and then these are mostly on the user login out activities. 0:13:42.860 --> 0:13:52.850 Ping Ping Lau And also we have options on a management API where we are using it quite a lot in other tickets to achieve some customizations. 0:13:54.70 --> 0:13:57.870 Ping Ping Lau Uh, I haven't able to repeat. 0:13:58.40 --> 0:14:2.830 Ping Ping Lau I mean to to test all the events because some I don't know how to make it trigger. 0:14:3.220 --> 0:14:5.150 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, but you can see here it's quite a long list. 0:14:7.680 --> 0:14:10.850 Ping Ping Lau And then, uh, on Amazon configurations. 0:14:10.910 --> 0:14:11.490 Ping Ping Lau Uh. 0:14:12.120 --> 0:14:35.360 Ping Ping Lau When we configure the the the stream to event bridge from Auth0, they view straight away to see people get this appear in Ms Son and then what we can do is but you will be in the pending status but we will have to associate it with the event bus then the the streaming will be running. 0:14:37.480 --> 0:14:37.960 Ping Ping Lau Umm. 0:14:39.860 --> 0:14:49.130 Ping Ping Lau And then, yeah, this this is a simple simple under functions that I used to so that it listens to the events in the event bridge. 0:14:49.180 --> 0:14:52.850 Ping Ping Lau And then here it's writing to the NSK. 0:14:55.650 --> 0:15:13.960 Ping Ping Lau Uh, so just want to show here that when we come to to complete the whole configuration, we also need the rules in Amazon and we can see here is we we can straight away select of zero from the partner instead of like configuring those rules manually. 0:15:14.750 --> 0:15:21.670 Ping Ping Lau So all these are already integrated integrated, so I will just do a quick demo. 0:15:21.880 --> 0:15:31.510 Ping Ping Lau Uh, this is the Kafka UI for the MSK, but I have a because we have lots of topics here. 0:15:31.520 --> 0:15:35.370 Ping Ping Lau I I and it's used by other tester for other testing purpose. 0:15:35.620 --> 0:15:38.890 Ping Ping Lau So I have created this topics to do this testing. 0:15:40.130 --> 0:15:44.480 Ping Ping Lau Let me just clear out everything first. 0:15:44.490 --> 0:15:46.60 Ping Ping Lau So that it's easier for us to see. 0:15:47.140 --> 0:16:0.940 Ping Ping Lau And then, uh, and we use this, this is application and deploy into KS and it will be pointing to the Office 0 for authentications. 0:16:5.660 --> 0:16:10.170 Ping Ping Lau For these other test using uh Federated login in Asia. 0:16:12.730 --> 0:16:17.180 Ping Ping Lau Ah yeah, so this this for the next tickets to discuss. 0:16:17.190 --> 0:16:28.70 Ping Ping Lau But OK, so after successfully log in then we should expect to see the those events be published to uh. 0:16:28.620 --> 0:16:31.620 Ping Ping Lau In this case you will take over, yeah, so. 0:16:33.780 --> 0:16:36.570 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, we can see these events is a Federated thing. 0:16:37.600 --> 0:16:50.780 Ping Ping Lau And if we check against in Auth0, we can see that these are the few uh events accepting, so we should be getting here. 0:16:53.40 --> 0:16:58.940 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, cheap will be I haven't configured to to stream all the events that is happening here. 0:17:1.160 --> 0:17:1.590 Ping Ping Lau Yeah. 0:17:1.600 --> 0:17:6.600 Ping Ping Lau So, uh, this is how we can do the change of integration. 0:17:8.560 --> 0:17:10.550 Ping Ping Lau Uh, any any questions about this? 0:17:12.360 --> 0:17:17.110 Duraid Wadie I think I think I'm just wondering why did you write it as See? 0:17:18.200 --> 0:17:20.820 Ping Ping Lau Oh, because we had. 0:17:21.440 --> 0:17:27.400 Ping Ping Lau We have a longer development, so it's a required additional development. 0:17:28.930 --> 0:17:29.460 Duraid Wadie OK. 0:17:29.340 --> 0:17:30.20 Ping Ping Lau So yeah. 0:17:29.530 --> 0:17:31.340 Duraid Wadie But really it's just a Lambda. 0:17:31.350 --> 0:17:32.610 Duraid Wadie You need to do that set. 0:17:34.160 --> 0:17:37.340 Ping Ping Lau Fall clothing wise, yes and that. 0:17:46.170 --> 0:17:46.660 Ping Ping Lau E. 0:17:36.650 --> 0:17:51.170 Duraid Wadie Yeah, I wouldn't write this as I see I think big thing is to to yeah, because they've actually done all of the hook into the event bridge creation and we can relate the Lambda just taking it from there and just pushing it to the queue, right. 0:17:52.30 --> 0:17:52.350 Ping Ping Lau I guess. 0:17:53.450 --> 0:17:53.920 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:17:53.930 --> 0:17:54.140 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:17:54.150 --> 0:17:54.520 Duraid Wadie OK. 0:17:54.370 --> 0:17:54.780 Ping Ping Lau Yeah. 0:17:54.680 --> 0:17:55.380 Duraid Wadie But perfect. 0:17:55.390 --> 0:17:55.600 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:17:54.820 --> 0:17:57.270 Ping Ping Lau Ohh yeah umm, but what one? 0:17:55.610 --> 0:17:59.0 Duraid Wadie So and there'll be some charge right on on this. 0:17:59.10 --> 0:17:59.620 Duraid Wadie But I don't think so. 0:17:59.630 --> 0:18:2.540 Duraid Wadie There will be nothing really, like maybe 50. 0:18:2.550 --> 0:18:6.940 Duraid Wadie Whatever is dollars a month what? 0:18:4.220 --> 0:18:7.380 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, they're regarding the pricing, right? 0:18:8.530 --> 0:18:11.960 Ping Ping Lau Uh, are you saying this that? 0:18:12.450 --> 0:18:13.620 Duraid Wadie No, but I don't think so. 0:18:13.630 --> 0:18:14.760 Duraid Wadie The expensive is it at all? 0:18:15.860 --> 0:18:16.350 Ping Ping Lau Yeah. 0:18:16.360 --> 0:18:20.690 Ping Ping Lau And I I just realized that I think I have done this calculation wrongly. 0:18:20.700 --> 0:18:28.60 Ping Ping Lau It's a should be times 30 and this is one day, but anyway it's still I think it's still very cheap. 0:18:32.290 --> 0:18:32.880 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah. 0:18:36.790 --> 0:18:37.740 Duraid Wadie You per day. 0:18:28.220 --> 0:18:38.420 Ping Ping Lau Probably it's below 1000 per month for 2,000,000 user and with the assumption said, yeah, we're talking five times, but they yeah. 0:18:37.750 --> 0:18:38.880 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah. 0:18:38.890 --> 0:18:45.850 Duraid Wadie I mean tabanus with the logs that are not cheap thing to deal with because even if you need to deal with it with key clock, right? 0:18:45.860 --> 0:18:46.940 Duraid Wadie It's the similar problem. 0:18:46.950 --> 0:18:47.120 Duraid Wadie What? 0:18:47.130 --> 0:18:49.470 Duraid Wadie You gonna put all of the slogan in the RDS cluster?

0:34:42.770 --> 0:35:2.550 Ping Ping Lau So, uh, we can also customize the email and before we are able to use before we are able to customize the email, we can we have to use our custom email provider and the good thing here is they have supported quite a number of email provider including send grid. 0:35:3.360 --> 0:35:11.830 Ping Ping Lau But there is a note here to say that if we want to use if our email provider is running behind firewall, we have to do all this white listing. 0:35:12.60 --> 0:35:15.210 Ping Ping Lau But when I do the testing I I don't have to request. 0:35:15.600 --> 0:35:18.310 Ping Ping Lau Whitelisting, probably inside. 0:35:18.320 --> 0:35:22.220 Ping Ping Lau We don't be allowed puppy access or I don't know this. 0:35:22.400 --> 0:35:24.150 Ping Ping Lau For me, this IP code is really wide. 0:35:24.160 --> 0:35:25.830 Ping Ping Lau Instead then? 0:35:25.840 --> 0:35:26.240 Ping Ping Lau Uh. 0:35:26.840 --> 0:35:39.940 Ping Ping Lau Just configure the API key for SANGRID and then after that we can go to the branding and customize the change password tablet so. 0:35:42.30 --> 0:35:50.340 Ping Ping Lau What I wanted to show here is because the reset password right, we want to send when the user is first logged in. 0:35:50.630 --> 0:36:2.940 Ping Ping Lau But we want to display a welcome message, but user can also click on the reset password in the login from the login page and uh for Auth0. 0:36:2.950 --> 0:36:5.640 Ping Ping Lau It doesn't have two different templates. 0:36:5.650 --> 0:36:16.660 Ping Ping Lau It's using the same templates for that, but the good thing here is again, we can make use of the meta data and then we can do some checking here to decide what to display under different conditions. 0:36:17.90 --> 0:36:21.180 Ping Ping Lau So for example, we store A is password reset flag. 0:36:22.200 --> 0:36:30.250 Ping Ping Lau So if he, if he's already reset, then we say this is a a password change request. 0:36:30.700 --> 0:36:41.850 Ping Ping Lau But if it is not yet set and this is first time to, it's a welcome even then we would say welcome email, but we can still show the reset password, right? 0:36:46.420 --> 0:36:46.690 Ping Ping Lau Yeah. 0:36:46.700 --> 0:36:49.900 Ping Ping Lau So after we customize the email right, we can actually get something like this. 0:36:55.800 --> 0:37:5.530 Ping Ping Lau And if user click on the reset password from the login page after they have logged in before then the email will show like this. 0:37:7.980 --> 0:37:12.430 Ping Ping Lau I think I pause it for a while for the user create in. 0:37:12.440 --> 0:37:13.650 Ping Ping Lau Any questions about this? 0:37:13.660 --> 0:37:15.670 Ping Ping Lau Or do you want to go to a table for this? 0:37:19.940 --> 0:37:23.350 Duraid Wadie I think from what I've seen Ping Ping here it's it's. 0:37:23.360 --> 0:37:26.430 Duraid Wadie This is for all of the suggests for the basic user creation, right? 0:37:27.900 --> 0:37:29.360 Ping Ping Lau Yes, for basic user creation. 0:37:30.460 --> 0:37:30.620 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 0:37:31.330 --> 0:37:36.540 Duraid Wadie And I think you really mimic the exact similar way to kick clock from what I've seen so far. 0:37:38.670 --> 0:37:41.100 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, for for this one. It works. 0:37:42.110 --> 0:37:43.990 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, we can do whatever keycloak can do. 0:37:45.70 --> 0:37:46.860 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah, yeah. 0:37:46.870 --> 0:37:48.80 Duraid Wadie I don't have any other questions. 0:37:48.90 --> 0:37:49.410 Duraid Wadie I think that's it looks really good. 0:37:51.740 --> 0:37:55.430 Ping Ping Lau OK, then the the second one will be on first login. 0:37:55.880 --> 0:37:58.731 Ping Ping Lau So first login i.e. 0:38:0.160 --> 0:38:1.410 Ping Ping Lau Let me just go through. 0:38:1.420 --> 0:38:2.810 Ping Ping Lau I think they might. 0:38:2.820 --> 0:38:4.390 Ping Ping Lau I just play played it again. 0:38:4.400 --> 0:38:5.990 Ping Ping Lau This is just about 30 seconds. 0:38:6.560 --> 0:38:12.610 Ping Ping Lau So for keycloak I when we first log in then it will ask for the consent. 0:38:21.180 --> 0:38:23.540 Ping Ping Lau Then you will pop up a password reset page. 0:38:29.370 --> 0:38:32.330 Ping Ping Lau So after that, yeah, this is how it will be ended. 0:38:32.340 --> 0:38:38.680 Ping Ping Lau Then we should be good to go through the login again and then compare to Office 0. 0:38:40.260 --> 0:38:41.450 Ping Ping Lau This is the default behavior. 0:38:57.950 --> 0:39:5.620 Ping Ping Lau Though this is the transient page and needs us now default it will pop up something like this and then it won't ask to reset. 0:39:5.660 --> 0:39:8.880 Ping Ping Lau So you just go in to the applications directly. 0:39:10.40 --> 0:39:11.200 Ping Ping Lau So uh. 0:39:13.420 --> 0:39:14.770 Ping Ping Lau Policies kick out. 0:39:14.780 --> 0:39:29.90 Ping Ping Lau We show the terms that the consent page and Auth0 also have the consent page, but is is the different purpose is to allow the applications and then for kicker we have the he said password but obviously we don't have a reset password. 0:39:29.840 --> 0:39:42.70 Ping Ping Lau So for this to handle the consent of, we have seen it is now in the consent page but to for the reset password, right? 0:39:42.780 --> 0:39:43.610 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, big, big. 0:39:43.780 --> 0:39:45.400 Ping Ping Lau We have two solutions here. 0:39:46.390 --> 0:39:48.940 Ping Ping Lau Uh one is we uh. 0:39:48.950 --> 0:39:57.160 Ping Ping Lau Sorry for before that we are able to actually disable the default of 0 consent page that we see this now. 0:39:57.570 --> 0:40:17.810 Ping Ping Lau So they also allow us to do this, and this is the step that we can do, but I I will highlight here is it only have it only can be done for what they call a first party client which means all the all the applications and the sister from the management console. 0:40:18.230 --> 0:40:22.840 Ping Ping Lau But for example, if you see we're running from local hole side then we cannot be. 0:40:22.890 --> 0:40:28.230 Ping Ping Lau We can't hide the consent page, but I think yeah, there is OK for the local host. 0:40:30.710 --> 0:40:35.400 Ping Ping Lau So for reset password there are two options that can think of. 0:40:35.790 --> 0:40:54.670 Ping Ping Lau One is a relate use of uh sending the reset password email when a user login for the for the first time and this is the I the click here and then we we attach it to this. 0:40:54.890 --> 0:40:56.80 Ping Ping Lau So I want to show. 0:40:56.130 --> 0:41:1.650 Ping Ping Lau I think we go through the process because we might need some decision over here to go for which options. 0:41:2.770 --> 0:41:5.630 Ping Ping Lau Let me configure this first. 0:41:8.190 --> 0:41:8.580 Ping Ping Lau In. 0:41:12.990 --> 0:41:14.930 Ping Ping Lau So reset password. 0:41:30.150 --> 0:41:30.680 Ping Ping Lau I will. 0:41:33.110 --> 0:41:33.410 Ping Ping Lau I would. 0:41:35.40 --> 0:41:36.140 Ping Ping Lau Peanut pound. 0:41:56.740 --> 0:42:1.470 Ping Ping Lau So when a user is created then we will get. 0:42:3.390 --> 0:42:5.840 Ping Ping Lau Please welcome email and then. 0:42:7.960 --> 0:42:9.710 Ping Ping Lau We do a reset password from here. 0:42:16.240 --> 0:42:19.550 Ping Ping Lau So the good thing about this option is we. 0:42:21.530 --> 0:42:28.700 Ping Ping Lau We uh, we are using back the change password screen and give all the behavior that we have. 0:42:29.130 --> 0:42:34.300 Ping Ping Lau So for example, let's say I'm changing password like then we will be getting all this. 0:42:34.660 --> 0:42:36.320 Ping Ping Lau Uh notes here. 0:42:39.750 --> 0:42:42.250 Ping Ping Lau And then I can do a reset password here but. 0:42:44.580 --> 0:42:53.190 Ping Ping Lau The issue here is we won't see the reset password screen appear in the login floor as we saw in keycloak. 0:42:53.710 --> 0:43:0.680 Ping Ping Lau So let's say a if I don't do a reset password right, then I go back to the application. 0:43:18.30 --> 0:43:26.130 Ping Ping Lau So the flow is even pop up the consent page after that because the user the reset password not yet happened. 0:43:26.140 --> 0:43:29.900 Ping Ping Lau So it will deny the access and direct it. 0:43:33.360 --> 0:43:34.300 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah. 0:43:29.910 --> 0:43:37.670 Ping Ping Lau This is what I mentioned that they in the off 0 call it go back to the yeah error page, yeah. 0:43:37.530 --> 0:43:43.380 Duraid Wadie Yeah, yeah, I think this is for me very nice error page we can create and throw it there. 0:43:43.550 --> 0:43:44.980 Duraid Wadie It's very valid to Venezuela. 0:43:44.990 --> 0:43:46.780 Duraid Wadie It doesn't even need to go to the application. 0:43:46.790 --> 0:43:48.300 Duraid Wadie The user needs to reset the password. 0:43:48.310 --> 0:43:51.280 Duraid Wadie We already told them to do so that we send an email to do that. 0:43:51.950 --> 0:43:53.240 Duraid Wadie We're gonna tell them, OK? 0:43:53.250 --> 0:43:54.270 Duraid Wadie Go reset your password. 0:43:54.280 --> 0:43:55.240 Duraid Wadie They have sent you an email. 0:43:55.250 --> 0:43:56.340 Duraid Wadie Go reset your password. 0:43:56.420 --> 0:43:57.230 Duraid Wadie Is that really simple? 0:43:57.240 --> 0:43:59.490 Duraid Wadie But once they've done this, they can log in and find, right? 0:44:0.720 --> 0:44:2.950 Ping Ping Lau Yes, I see a tennis. 0:44:1.750 --> 0:44:3.880 Duraid Wadie Yeah, I mean, that's what else can we do, right?

0:58:34.750 --> 0:58:35.100 SueAnn See OK. 0:58:37.100 --> 0:58:37.320 Anthony Wong OK. 0:58:36.730 --> 0:58:39.970 Ping Ping Lau OK, then I just, yeah, I would just go through this funding. 0:58:40.490 --> 0:58:47.440 Ping Ping Lau So for this is to yeah, the behavior for this, OK, you just go to this. 0:58:47.670 --> 0:58:51.960 Ping Ping Lau The default behavior for 0 right is raising middle to into. 0:58:52.270 --> 0:58:56.150 Ping Ping Lau That means for those Federated user it will just auto. 0:58:57.840 --> 0:59:9.480 Ping Ping Lau Although create into the database after it's after user authenticated successfully in in the external queue and we cannot, we cannot create a user. 0:59:10.580 --> 0:59:11.610 Ping Ping Lau Ohh, thought of it. 0:59:11.620 --> 0:59:14.430 Ping Ping Lau Return in in of 0 manually. 0:59:14.720 --> 0:59:25.540 Ping Ping Lau It doesn't allow us to do that so but example when we create a user like table they ask us which connection is it. 0:59:25.870 --> 0:59:39.350 Ping Ping Lau So for the connections the photo Federated locked in there, the connection is really the price connection and we can see that it won't appear as an options when we create a user. 0:59:39.900 --> 0:59:47.280 Ping Ping Lau So there is the behavior of the uh, they they did not eat so. 0:59:51.480 --> 0:59:54.730 Ping Ping Lau So the test medications, if we can do a day, are two options. 0:59:54.740 --> 1:0:13.380 Ping Ping Lau I started with the action using the action secret, but after I completed this I found out that there are limitation on the secret because the number of the the length that you can store is up to 2000 plus which means that we can only let store probably like 50 emails maybe. 1:0:13.440 --> 1:0:14.650 Ping Ping Lau So I don't think this is a. 1:0:14.940 --> 1:0:15.330 Ping Ping Lau This is a. 1:0:18.400 --> 1:0:22.90 Ping Ping Lau Solutions is acceptable, so I will just go to the another one. 1:0:22.140 --> 1:0:33.960 Ping Ping Lau She's using the off 0 database connections, So what we can do here is they just put the type when here the the behavior is like. 1:0:35.880 --> 1:0:44.230 Ping Ping Lau Umm, what I proposed to do like is when again perform user provision a user it registered the external user. 1:0:44.920 --> 1:0:46.250 Ping Ping Lau But take a look at this box. 1:0:46.260 --> 1:0:48.50 Ping Ping Lau Is everything within the Office 0? 1:0:48.100 --> 1:0:56.10 Ping Ping Lau So what we can do is we can add those external user into a database in of you. 1:0:56.100 --> 1:0:57.990 Ping Ping Lau So we show what I'm here. 1:1:2.890 --> 1:1:4.40 Ping Ping Lau That's the database. 1:1:4.610 --> 1:1:10.120 Ping Ping Lau So for example, we can actually create another database in Auth0 and I call it. 1:1:10.390 --> 1:1:12.500 Ping Ping Lau This is the external user allowed base. 1:1:13.10 --> 1:1:16.850 Ping Ping Lau So we can create those user into this database. 1:1:25.60 --> 1:1:26.230 Ping Ping Lau So Python gives it to. 1:1:26.280 --> 1:1:31.450 Ping Ping Lau To do that and then when user login like it it, it has to go through this process first. 1:1:31.460 --> 1:1:34.530 Ping Ping Lau It's go to the go to the the end. 1:1:34.540 --> 1:1:42.750 Ping Ping Lau After authenticated it come back then and I do notice that when login successful it actually goes to the sign up process. 1:1:43.280 --> 1:1:54.10 Ping Ping Lau But the unfortunate thing is we cannot add a actions in the sign up for the Federated won't figure the actions it will trigger for internal user. 1:1:54.460 --> 1:2:7.670 Ping Ping Lau So that's why we cannot add trigger here to say I check when user assigning up but instead what we can do is only when user log after successfully logged in then. 1:2:10.70 --> 1:2:10.510 Ping Ping Lau We will. 1:2:12.920 --> 1:2:36.440 Ping Ping Lau So for this the process here is after successfully logged in, the default behavior for all zero is able just insert a record into a default the the database that be teached to the applications and then it will come back to the post or in action where we can do a validation here to to check whether the log the email exists in this external user list. 1:2:36.820 --> 1:2:52.570 Ping Ping Lau So if a exists, then we just the was it, if the login, if it doesn't exist we can we have to actually perform the delete user API call so that it delete the user from a from this database. 1:2:52.650 --> 1:3:0.690 Ping Ping Lau Then we deny the log in, so this is something that, uh, the work around that I can find to control. 1:3:1.590 --> 1:3:5.600 Ping Ping Lau Ohh which is the user list that we want to allow them to access. 1:3:9.860 --> 1:3:10.240 Duraid Wadie Yeah. 1:3:10.250 --> 1:3:15.490 Duraid Wadie And the guys looking for or maybe a maybe it will be another option, isn't it from both sale, yeah. 1:3:14.280 --> 1:3:22.200 Ping Ping Lau Yet they they are saying that it's not release is in India met but don't know when. 1:3:23.570 --> 1:3:26.180 Duraid Wadie Also, they said that something they doing in that road map for this. 1:3:27.250 --> 1:3:29.290 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, they said they is is in the room. 1:3:30.910 --> 1:3:31.190 Duraid Wadie OK. 1:3:32.700 --> 1:3:39.310 Duraid Wadie So that's mean we need to live with post action login and write so the user has actually logged in, but we can validate it. 1:3:39.320 --> 1:3:44.130 Duraid Wadie Then we can throw it out if we it doesn't exist in the internal database. 1:3:47.820 --> 1:3:48.100 Ping Ping Lau Umm. 1:3:44.140 --> 1:3:50.250 Duraid Wadie Do you know like the second time when the second time happens right we can say is this user validated right?

1:4:17.950 --> 1:4:23.700 Duraid Wadie That user give delete the attribute as well, so that's the work probably needs to happen is that. 1:4:24.200 --> 1:4:24.650 Ping Ping Lau Yeah, yeah. 1:4:25.490 --> 1:4:29.640 Ping Ping Lau If you keep it in the attributes, then we go to clear up from two places. 1:4:27.870 --> 1:4:31.210 Duraid Wadie Yeah.

Is there some way for us to detect a consent update since the user agreed? I can’t imagine an admin touching 100s of tenants. Extract from the transcript above and answer the above 2 questions how when legal document change, Auth0 can detect it automatically.","completion":"For addressing the scenarios where legal documents change and there's a need to reset user consent in Auth0, the transcript doesn't provide a direct out-of-the-box solution for automatically detecting legal document changes and resetting consents. However, we can use the insights and capabilities discussed to suggest a way to manage this process: **1. Allow Admin to Reset Consent Whenever Legal Document Changes:** Auth0's flexibility with actions (custom code executed during authentication transactions) and its Management API can be leveraged to facilitate the admin's ability to reset consent when legal documents change. While the transcript doesn’t describe an automatic detection of legal document changes, we can infer a strategy to manually trigger consent reset: - **Custom Consent Management:** As hinted by the use of metadata and post-login actions, an admin can implement a mechanism to reset consent by leveraging user metadata to store versioning or timestamps related to the latest consent agreement. When a legal document changes, the admin updates the consent version/timestamp required in the system. - **Management API for Bulk Operations:** To reset consent for many users, the admin can use the Auth0 Management API to programmatically iterate through users and update their metadata to reflect that they need to re-consent, based on the new legal document version. **2. Automatically Detecting Consent Update Needs:** While the transcript doesn’t directly offer a solution for automatic detection of legal document changes, we can propose a method that combines the use of external tools and Auth0 capabilities: - **Version Control for Legal Documents:** Maintain the legal documents in a version-controlled environment. Use webhooks or similar mechanisms to get notified when a document is updated. - **Automated Script/Service:** Develop an automated script or service that listens to the version control webhook. Upon detecting a change, this service uses the Auth0 Management API to mark all users or specific tenant users as needing to re-consent, possibly by updating a ‘legal_document_version’ field in the user’s app_metadata. - **Login Flow Checks:** Utilize Auth0 Actions or Rules to check the user’s \`app_metadata\` for the \`legal_document_version\` during the login flow. If the user's version does not match the current version, redirect the user to a consent flow and withhold access until they agree to the new terms. This approach does not directly automate the detection within Auth0 but leverages external triggers (documents' version control) and Auth0's capabilities (Management API, Actions/Rules, and metadata) to achieve a semi-automated process for resetting user consent upon legal document changes."},{"prompt":"based on the transcript, does Auth0 provide a direct out-of-the-box solution for automatically detecting legal document changes and resetting consents?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the transcript, Auth0 does not provide a direct out-of-the-box solution for automatically detecting legal document changes and resetting consents. The discussions in the transcript primarily focus on leveraging Auth0's capabilities and custom code (such as using Actions for post-login checks, Management API for user metadata manipulation, and custom consent screens) to manage user consent manually or semi-automatically. For scenarios like detecting legal document changes and requiring users to re-consent, solutions would likely involve custom development outside of Auth0's direct features, such as version control for legal documents, external notifications when documents change, and scripts or services that use Auth0's API to update user consent status."},{"prompt":"{SNOW BIOME - TERRARIA} Mechanic: “Hey, [player]?

Assuming you want to load a pre-trained model and use it for prediction, here are the steps you might follow. This example uses TensorFlow 2.x and demonstrates how to load the MobileNetV2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, preprocess an image, and use the model to predict the image class. First, ensure you have TensorFlow installed. If not, you can install it using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install tensorflow \`\`\` Here are the three lines of code you might use, followed by a slight breakdown of each step: \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)) predictions = model.predict(tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(tf.image.resize(images, (224, 224)))) \`\`\` Explanation: 1. **Import TensorFlow**: You start by importing TensorFlow. TensorFlow includes the Keras API, which provides access to various deep learning models, including pre-trained CNNs. \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf \`\`\` 2. **Load the Pre-trained Model**: Here, you load the MobileNetV2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. You need to specify the \`weights='imagenet'\` to use the pre-trained weights. The \`input_shape\` parameter is required to match the input shape the model was originally trained with. For MobileNetV2, the standard input size is \`224x224\` pixels with 3 color channels (RGB). \`\`\`python model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)) \`\`\` 3. **Prepare Your Image and Predict**: Before making a prediction, you must preprocess your input image to match the format the model expects. This typically involves resizing the image to the required dimensions and applying any necessary scaling/color normalization. Many pre-trained models in Keras come with their own \`preprocess_input\` function tailored for this purpose. Here, you're also resizing the image to the expected size using \`tf.image.resize()\`. The \`model.predict()\` method is then called to classify the image. Note: This line assumes you have an image tensor named \`images\`.

This transformation changes your labels from a single integer to a vector of zeros except for the position representing the class, which is marked with a 1. Given this additional detail, here's how you can adjust the workflow to handle \`typeIds\` as your label data: # Step 1: One-hot Encode Your Labels TensorFlow's Keras API provides a convenient function called \`to_categorical\` to easily convert integer labels to a one-hot encoded format.

To do this, you first need to make predictions on your test set, as discussed in our previous example on making predictions. Once you have the predictions, you can use utilities from \`sklearn.metrics\` or any other library to compute various scores. For instance, to compute the precision, recall, and F1 score, you would first need the predictions in your true label format: \`\`\`python from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score # Assuming \`X_test\` is preprocessed and \`y_test\` are true integer labels (not one-hot encoded) predictions = model.predict(X_test) predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) # Convert predictions to 1D array for class labels # Calculate precision, recall, and F1 score precision = precision_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') recall = recall_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') f1 = f1_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') print(f'Precision: {precision:.4f}, Recall: {recall:.4f}, F1 Score: {f1:.4f}') \`\`\` Note: You need to make sure to match the \`average\` parameter in these functions to your specific task (e.g., binary, micro, macro, weighted, etc.), depending on whether your problem is binary classification, multi-class, or multi-label, and depending on how you want to treat class imbalance. # Considerations - Always ensure your test data has been preprocessed in the same manner as your training data. - When interpreting scoring metrics, consider the nature of your dataset (i.e., balance vs. imbalance) and the problem domain to choose the most appropriate metrics. - TensorFlow 2.x also allows for custom metric functions if you have very specific needs not covered by built-in metrics or Scikit-Learn."},{"prompt":"ValueError: Input 0 of layer \\"conv2d\\" is incompatible with the layer: expected min_ndim=4, found ndim=2. Full shape received: (None, 784)","completion":"The error message you're encountering suggests that the model expects input with a minimum of 4 dimensions, but it's receiving input with only 2 dimensions. This situation is common when working with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras, as CNNs expect input data in the form of a 4D tensor - \`[batch_size, height, width, channels]\`. For example, when working with grayscale images (single channel) of size 28x28, each individual image's shape should be \`[28, 28, 1]\`, and for RGB images (three channels), the shape should be \`[28, 28, 3]\`.

In the context of your reported sizes, it looks like you have \`188\` true labels and \`93\` predictions (or vice versa). Such a mismatch can happen for a few reasons: 1. **Misaligned Dataset Splits:** Ensure both your features (\`X\`) and labels (\`y\`) have been split correctly and correspond to each other one-to-one in the training and testing phases. 2. **Batch Size in the Last Step of Prediction:** If you're making predictions in batches (which is common), the final batch may not be full if the total number of samples is not divisible by the batch size. This usually isn't a problem with TensorFlow's \`model.predict()\` method as it can handle variable batch sizes seamlessly. However, it's something to consider if you've manually implemented batch handling. 3. **Data Filtering or Augmentation:** Sometimes, during preprocessing (e.g., data augmentation or filtering steps), the data size might be unintentionally altered. Ensure these steps are consistent between training and prediction phases. # How to Troubleshoot and Fix It 1. **Verify Dataset Sizes:** Make sure the sizes of your datasets match up precisely at each step (preprocessing, splitting, batching). \`\`\`python print(trainTestData['train']['X'].shape) print(trainTestData['train']['y'].shape) print(trainTestData['test']['X'].shape) print(trainTestData['test']['y'].shape) \`\`\` 2. **Examine Prediction Step:** When making predictions, ensure that you are predicting on the entire test set without any unintended filtering or slicing. \`\`\`python # Assuming model and test data (X_test) are defined predictions = model.predict(trainTestData['test']['X']) predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) print(predicted_classes.shape) \`\`\` 3. **Ensure Matching Numbers:** The shape of \`predicted_classes\` should match the number of samples in \`trainTestData['test']['y']\`.

Now, to address the inconsistency error (\`ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [188, 93]\`) with respect to the previous instructions, the key points of conflict likely arise from the mismatch between the number of predictions (\`predicted_classes\`) and the number of true labels in \`trainTestData['test']['y']\`.

To calculate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, you can use scikit-learn's \`precision_score\`, \`recall_score\`, and \`f1_score\` functions. Assuming \`y_test\` is your true labels array and \`predicted_classes\` is the array of predictions shared in your message, you'll first want to make sure both are numpy arrays to avoid any potential issues: \`\`\`python import numpy as np from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score # Assuming your predicted_classes array is named as such and y_test is your true labels array predicted_classes = np.array([12, 13, ...]) # Your predictions y_test = np.array(y_test) # Your true labels, ensure it's an array # Calculate precision, recall and F1 score precision = precision_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') recall = recall_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') f1 = f1_score(y_test, predicted_classes, average='weighted') print(f\\"Precision: {precision:.4f}\\") print(f\\"Recall: {recall:.4f}\\") print(f\\"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}\\") \`\`\` Here, using the parameter \`average='weighted'\` takes into account label imbalance; it calculates metrics for each label, and finds their average weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label). Make sure that both \`y_test\` and \`predicted_classes\` are properly aligned, meaning they have the same length and correspond to the same data instances. A mismatch could either indicate an issue with how the data was split or how the model predictions were generated or collected. Given the metrics you've posted, it seems like you've managed to address the size mismatch issue mentioned earlier, so these steps should work assuming \`y_test\` is correctly aligned with your predictions."},{"prompt":"def getBestTrainedMLPModel( self , maxScore ): mlp = None erreicht = False i = 1 highestModel = None highestScore = 0 while not(erreicht): trainTestData = self.getTestTrainData() mlp = MLPClassifier( hidden_layer_sizes=(27), activation='logistic', alpha=1e-4, solver='sgd', tol=1e-4, random_state=1, learning_rate_init=.1, verbose=True ) mlp.fit(trainTestData['train']['X'], trainTestData['train']['y']) score = mlp.score(trainTestData['test']['X'],trainTestData['test']['y']) print(f'{i}: {round(score*100,5)}') if score >= maxScore: erreicht = True i += 1 if score > highestScore: highestScore = score highestModel = mlp if i > 50: break; self.mlp = highestModel print(f'Höchste Score: {highestScore}') return highestModel def predictMLP( self , image, verbose=False): if self.mlp == None: print('Es kann keine Vorhersage getroffen werden, da das MLP nicht init ist!') return None predictedVirtualId = mlp.predict(image.reshape(1,-1)) predictedElement = iEM.getImageElementFromVirtualId( predictedVirtualId ) if verbose: if predictedElement == None: print(f'Vorhergesagtes Element mit VirtualId: {predictedVirtualId} wurde nicht gefunden!') else: print(f'Folgendes wurde vorhergesagt: {predictedElement.name} des Types: {predictedElement.typeName}') return predictedVirtualId please get me 2 new functions to use keras","completion":"To recreate a similar functionality to your described approach for training and predicting with an \`MLPClassifier\` using scikit-learn but instead using Keras (with TensorFlow backend), we will focus on two main functions: one for training the best model (similar to \`getBestTrainedMLPModel\`) and another for making predictions (\`predictMLP\`).

The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest possible route that visits each location exactly once and returns to the starting point. For small instances (like with 6 locations), it is feasible to compute the solution using brute force — that is, enumerating all possible routes, calculating their total distances, and selecting the shortest one. In our case, we'll represent the graph as a distance matrix where the rows and columns represent locations, and each cell's value represents the distance between those locations. We'll then implement a solution in Lua, which will include generating all permutations of locations (to represent all possible routes), calculating the total distance for each route, and identifying the route with the least total distance.

(No code needed) but explain a 'practical , efficient way to do it'","completion":"Packing randomly sized rectangles into a minimal number of pages (or bins, in the context of the bin packing problem) is a variation of the 2D bin packing problem, which is NP-hard. This implies that finding the absolute optimal solution efficiently for any arbitrary set of rectangles and page sizes is computationally infeasible for large instances. However, there are practical, efficient heuristic algorithms that can produce good, often near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Here's a practical approach incorporating several strategies: # 1. Sort Rectangles Start by sorting the rectangles based on one or more attributes, such as height, width, or area, in descending order. This is known as the First Fit Decreasing (FFD) heuristic when combined with the next step. Sorting ensures that larger items are placed first, potentially allowing for a tighter packing by filling in gaps with smaller rectangles later. # 2. Apply Packing Algorithms Guillotine Cut: This heuristic recursively divides pages into smaller regions using cuts parallel to the edges. It's effective but may not always utilize space optimally since it can lead to awkward leftover spaces. Shelf Packing: Rectangles are placed on shelves (horizontal rows). Each new rectangle is placed on the current shelf if it fits; otherwise, a new shelf is started. Variations handle rectangle rotation, shelf height optimization, and different sorting rules (e.g., Next Fit, Best Fit). MaxRects: It keeps track of all the \\"free\\" rectangles (maximal rectangles where no items are placed within) on the canvas. For each new rectangle, it finds the best position among the free rectangles according to rules like Best Short Side Fit, Best Long Side Fit, Best Area Fit, or Bottom-Left. It's known for its effectiveness in texture atlas packing and can be faster with good implementations. Skyline: This algorithm tracks a \\"skyline\\" (or silhouette) of the already packed rectangles. Each new rectangle is placed on the lowest possible line (\\"y-coordinate\\") that has enough horizontal space. This method tries to keep the packing height minimal. # 3. Rotate Rectangles (If Allowed) Allowing rectangles to be rotated can significantly improve packing efficiency. However, this should be done taking into account any constraints regarding the orientation of the rectangles. # 4. Heuristic Improvements - **Splitting**: When a large page has significant wasted space, consider splitting it into smaller pages if possible. - **Merging**: After initial placement, attempt to merge pages if doing so reduces the total page count without violating constraints. - **Local Search**: After initial packing, perform local optimizations. For example, try moving, rotating, or swapping rectangles to fill gaps or free up space. # 5. Multiple Passes with Variations Run the packing algorithm multiple times with different strategies (e.g., different sorting criteria, packing heuristics) and choose the best outcome. This can counteract the weaknesses of any single approach. # Summary For practical applications, it's often best to combine several of these strategies, experimenting with different heuristics and parameters. Starting with a straightforward algorithm like Shelf Packing can provide a baseline. Then, techniques like Skyline or MaxRects can be employed to optimize further, especially for specific types of rectangle distributions. Due to the complexity, a meta-heuristic approach (iterating over different strategies) may yield the best practical results, striking a balance between computational time and packing efficiency."},{"prompt":"Compute a square root in fast way, YOu have addition, subtraction and shift operations on binary values...","completion":"Computing the square root of a number quickly using only addition, subtraction, and binary shift operations can be efficiently achieved through a method akin to the \\"bitwise binary search\\" or using the \\"non-restoring square root algorithm.\\" However, both of these methods can be somewhat intricate due to their bitwise manipulations. A common, fast, and more intuitive way, leveraging binary operations that meets the criteria set—especially under constraints prohibiting multiplication, division, or floating-point arithmetic—is essentially a binary search algorithm applied for square root calculation. Here's a conceptual explanation of a method similar to binary search that efficiently utilizes binary shifting (a form of efficiently multiplying or dividing by powers of 2) to find the square root of a given non-negative integer \`N\`. Binary shifts can be perceived as doubling or halving, corresponding to multiplication or division by 2, respectively. Thus, \`n << 1\` equals \`n * 2\`, and \`n >> 1\` equals \`n / 2\` in integer math. # Conceptual Overview: 1. **Initialization**: Define the lower and upper bounds of your search. For a square root, the lower bound can start at \`0\`, and the upper bound can be \`(N >> 1) + 1\` or simply \`N\` if \`N\` is less than 2, since the square root of a number cannot be larger than the number itself divided by 2 (plus one to cover the square root of numbers less than 4). 2. **Binary Search with Bitwise Operations**: Apply a binary search within this range. In each iteration, you choose the midpoint between the lower and upper bounds (\`mid = (low + high) >> 1\`). Then, you square this midpoint (using a method adapted to your constraints, possibly iterative addition) and compare it to \`N\`. - If the square of \`mid\` is greater than \`N\`, you know the square root must be less, so you adjust the upper bound to \`mid - 1\`. - If it's less, the square root must be higher, so you adjust the lower bound to \`mid + 1\`. - If you find an exact match, \`mid\` is the square root. 3. **Termination and Approximation**: If an exact square root isn't critical (or for non-perfect squares), the iteration stops when the interval between the lower and upper bounds can no longer be split (when \`low\` exceeds \`high\`). At this point, if an exact square root has not been found (which is common), \`high\` will be the largest integer less than the square root of \`N\`, providing a floor approximation. # Why This Is Fast: This method is efficient, especially for large numbers, because it: - Reduces the problem space by half with each iteration, leading to a logarithmic (log₂N) time complexity. - Leverages bit shifts for multiplication and division, which are faster operations than their arithmetic counterparts. # Limitations: - This method outlined offers an integer approximation of the square root. - For floating-point precision, additional steps or algorithms (such as Newton's method) are necessary, which may not strictly adhere to the operation constraints described. # Additional Note: Calculating the square explicitly in each iteration with only addition and subtraction (without multiplication) can be challenging but still feasible. An alternative direct bitwise approach for squaring can be designed but often results in more complexity, making the simple binary search approach (with attention to how the \\"squaring\\" is implemented) an elegant solution under the operation constraints provided."},{"prompt":"{SNOW BIOME - TERRARIA} Mechanic: “Hey, [player]?

Although there isn't a specific clause that mentions feeding a pastor with food in a literal sense, the principle of supporting those who work in spreading the gospel can be seen in passages regarding the support of church leaders. One of the most cited verses in support of this concept is 1 Timothy 5:17-18 (ESV): \\"Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer deserves his wages.”\\" The reference to not muzzling an ox as it works (citing Deuteronomy 25:4) and that \\"The laborer deserves his wages\\" (echoing Jesus' words in Luke 10:7) are used here to justify financial support or other forms of sustenance for church leaders. Though it's not exclusively talking about food, the principle behind these passages suggests providing for the needs of those who dedicate their lives to ministry, which could include food, financial support, shelter, etc. Galatians 6:6 is another verse that alludes to supporting teachers in the church: \\"One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches.\\" This could be interpreted to include sharing resources such as food with those who provide spiritual instruction. Overall, while there's not a single verse that explicitly says to \\"feed the pastor,\\" the broader biblical principle of caring for and providing for those in ministry is well established."},{"prompt":"Ulus devletlerin mevcut örgütlenmelerin yerine sınırsız yetkilerle ve sınırsız kaynaklarla donatılmış yeni bir küresel ve uluslararası örgütlenmeye gidilse ve ekonomi, siyaset, bilim, teknoloji, kültür, sanat, toplum ve bir bütün olarak insanlığın hayatı şu ilkeyi daha etkili şekilde gerçekleştirebilmek üzere yeniden ve yeniden örgütlense nasıl bir medeniyet inşa edilebilir: \\"aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği\\" ( 1- insanlığın geleceği için en güçlü genlerin yapay olarak seçilebilmesi amacıyla sadece beden-duygu-zihin kriterlerinde ayrı ayrı yapılacak yeterlilik testlerini geçebilen erkek ve kadınların bebek yapmasına izin verilecek. 2- seçilen çiftler özel düzenlenmiş huzurlu ve tutkulu aşk yuvalarında sevişecekler. başarılı gebelik gerçekleştiği andan itibaren bütün imkanlar bütün hamile kadınlar için ihtiyaçları oranında eşit bir titizlikle seferber edilecek. 3- bebekler biyolojik baba ve annenin değil bütün bir insanlık ailesinin evladı kabul edilecek. baba ve annenin kendi bebeklerini kayırması, yani tarihte aile kurumunu ortaya çıkaran bu hayvani temel dürtü geliştirilecek hukuk sistemi, inşa edilecek toplum örgütlenmesi, kazandırılacak etik değerler ve aşılanacak hümanizm ruhu ile kesin şekilde önlenecek. 4- bebekler anne sütü ile beslendikten sonra 3 yaşına gelince baba ve anneden alınarak insanlık ailesine dahil edilecekler ve her alanda tam bir adaletle yapılacak yetenek testlerinin başlayacağı çocukluk yaşına kadar diğer bütün bebeklerle eşit olanaklarla büyütülecekler. 5- bebek havuzundaki her bebeğin bütün yeteneklerini insanlık yararına ortaya çıkarabilmesi için bilimsel olarak belirlenen yaşlarda bilim, sanat, spor, el becerisi, liderlik vb. hayatın bütün alanlarına yönelik kapsamlı ve adil testler yapılacak. )","completion":"Bu tür bir düşünce, utopik veya distopik kurguları akıllara getiriyor. Ancak sunulan senaryoyu insanlığın geleceği adına yapılan bir tasarım ve düşünsel bir oyun olarak incelemek mümkündür. Tasarlanan medeniyet modeli, özellikle genetik seçim, bireyin topluma olan katkısının maksimize edilmesi, ve tüm çocuklara eşit şartlar sağlama gibi öğeler üzerine kurulu. 1. İnsanlığın Genetik Mühendisliği ile Yeniden Tasarımı: Bu sistem, genetik olarak uygun bulunan bireylerin çoğalmasına izin vererek, insan neslinin belli bedensel, zihinsel ve duygusal özelliklerle donatılmasını amaçlar. Bu, genetik hastalıkların ve belirli zihinsel ya da fiziksel sınırlılıkların azaltılmasına yardımcı olabilecek bir yön taşırken aynı zamanda etik soruları ve biyolojik çeşitliliğin azalma riskini de beraberinde getirir. 2. Sevgi ve Yetiştirilme Ortamlarının Standartlaştırılması: Bebeklerin ilk andan itibaren en ideal koşullarda yetiştirilmeleri, gelişimlerinin en iyi şekilde desteklenmesini amaçlar. Ancak, insan ilişkileri ve bağların tek bir modelle sınırlanması, sevgi ve aidiyet gibi karmaşık duyguların yapaylaştırılması anlamına gelebilir. 3. Toplumsal ve Ailesel Bağların Yeniden Tanımlanması: Bebeklerin biyolojik ebeveynlerinden ziyade insanlık ailesine mensup kabul edilmesi, aile bağlarının ve doğal ebeveyn çocuk ilişkisinin ortadan kalkmasına yol açar. Bu durum, bireylerin kimlik, aidiyet ve kültürel miras ile olan bağlarını zayıflatabilir. 4. Eşit Başlangıç Koşulları: Her çocuğa eşit olanaklar sunulması, sosyoekonomik ayrımları azaltır ve her bireyin potansiyelinin en iyi şekilde kullanılmasını teşvik eder. Ancak, bu yaklaşımın uygulanabilirliği ve bireysel özgürlükler ile çatışma potansiyeli bir risk teşkil eder. 5. Tamamiyle Meritokratik Bir Toplum: Herkesin yetenek ve kabiliyetlerine göre yönlendirildiği bir toplum, verimlilik ve inovasyonu teşvik ederken, bireysel tercihlerin ve tutkuların sınırlandırılması gibi sorunlara yol açabilir. Sonuç olarak, bu düşünsel tasarım ilginç bir medeniyet modeli önermekte ve bazı açılardan idealize edilmiş bir toplum portresi çizmektedir. Ancak, insan doğası, toplumsal çeşitlilik ve bireysel özgürlüklere ilişkin kapsamlı etik ve uygulanabilirlik sorunlarını barındırır. Gerçek dünyada böyle bir modelin uygulanabilirliği, getireceği etik, toplumsal ve bireysel mücadeleler göz önünde bulundurulduğunda ciddi sınamalar doğuracaktır.

Temelinde özgürlük, eşitlik, bilim ve sanatın insan yaşamını yüceltme gücüne olan inancı barındırır. Şiirin merkezinde yatan \\"aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği\\" ilkesi, medeniyetin yeniden kurgulanışında adil bir temel oluşturur. Bu medeniyet tasarımında, bireyin özgürleşmesi, kendini gerçekleştirmesi ve kolektif insanlık ailesinin bir parçası olarak katkıda bulunması esastır. 1. Öncelikle, bu medeniyet bilimi ve ilerlemeyi insanın lehine kullanmayı amaçlar. Atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde ölümsüzlüğü arayan bir yaklaşım, bilimin sınırlarını genişleterek insan yaşamını uzatma ve kalitesini artırma peşindedir. Bu, sağlık, genetik mühendisliği, uzay araştırmaları ve nanoteknoloji gibi alanlarda ciddi yatırımlarla desteklenir. 2. Kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde hayatın tadına varmak, medeniyetin sanat ve edebiyatı insan ruhunu besleyen, bireyin özgürlük ve ifade alanlarını genişleten temel unsurlar olarak kabul ettiğini ifade eder. Burada bilişsel ve duygusal gelişimi zenginleştiren, toplumda empati ve anlayışı artıran bir kültür politikası yatıyor. 3. Doğaya hayranlık, dans ve şarkı ile ifade edilen çırılçıplak özgürlük, bireyin doğa ile barışık, kendinden emin ve özgür bir yaşamı benimsemesini önerir. Bu, ekolojik bilincin geliştirilmesi, doğa koruma çalışmalarının yaygınlaştırılması ve insanların doğal dünyayla uyum içinde yaşaması gerektiğini vurgular. 4. Engellilere öpücük kondurulması ve sarhoş şairlerin neşeli çocuklar tarafından salıncaklarda sallanması, medeniyetin bireysel farklılıkları ve çeşitliliği kucaklayan, kapsayıcı bir toplum yapısını hedeflediğini gösterir. Bu, her bireyin değerli ve önemli olduğu, kimse için dışlama veya ayrımcılığa yer olmayan bir toplumu simgeler. 5. Olimpiyat ruhunun her alandaki rekabeti kuşatması, adil bir rekabetin ve insan yeteneklerinin en yüksek seviyede teşvik edilmesinin önemini vurgular. Ödül, ceza ve adaletin ölümden önce gelmesi ilkesi ise, bu dünyada adaletin sağlanması ve her bireyin eylemlerinin anlamlı ve önemli sonuçlar doğurduğu bir toplumsal yapıyı ifade eder. Sonuç olarak, bu şiirin temsil ettiği medeniyet, insanlık için iyimser, yenilikçi ve dönüştürücü bir vizyon sunmakta; bireylerin özgürce kendilerini gerçekleştirmelerini, bilim ve sanatla insan yaşamını zenginleştirmelerini, doğa ve birbirleriyle barış içinde yaşamalarını ve tüm insanların eşit şartlarda başlamalarını teşvik etmektedir.

Ancak, bu tür bir sistem etik, pratik ve felsefi birçok soru ve meydan okumayı da beraberinde getirir. Önerilen model, bireylerin yaşamları üzerinde devlet ya da bir küresel otoritenin aşırı derecede kontrol sahibi olması fikrine dayanmaktadır. Bu, pek çok demokratik ve özgürlükçü ilkeyle çelişir. Ayrıca, \\"en güçlü genlerin\\" seçilmesi kavramı etik olarak büyük sorunlar yaratır ve tarihte eugenics (ırk ıslahı) hareketleriyle benzerlikler gösterir. Bu hareketler, insanlık tarihinde bazı karanlık dönemlere yol açmıştır. 1. **Genetik Seçim:** En güçlü genlerin yapay olarak seçilmesi, genetik çeşitliliği azaltabilir ve uzun vadede insan popülasyonunun belirli hastalıklara karşı savunmasız hale gelmesine neden olabilir. Ayrıca, kimin \\"en güçlü\\" ya da \\"yeterli\\" olduğuna karar vermek, subjektif ve potansiyel olarak tehlikeli bir süreçtir. 2. **Aşk Yuvaları ve Gebelik:** Bu konsept, insan ilişkilerini ve üreme süreçlerini büyük ölçüde düzenleyen bir yaklaşımı temsil eder. Bu tür bir düzenleme, kişisel özgürlüğe ve seçimlere ciddi sınırlamalar getirir. 3. **Bebeklerin Toplumsal Mülkiyeti:** Bebeklerin biyolojik ebeveynlerinden alınarak \\"insanlık ailesine\\" dahil edilmesi, aile bağlarının önemini ve bireyin kendi kökenine olan bağlılığını küçümser. Bu, bireysel kimlik ve aidiyet duygusunu zedeleyebilir. 4. **Eşit Yetenek Testleri:** Her alanda adil yetenek testleri yapılması fikri, bireylerin eşit fırsatlara sahip olması ve yeteneklerinin tam potansiyelini gerçekleştirebilmesi açısından cazip görünse de, bu testlerin gerçekten objektif ve adil olup olmadığı sorusu ortaya çıkar. Bu tür bir sistemde, bireysel çeşitlilik ve farklılıkların değerinin azaltılma riski vardır. 5. **Eğitim ve Gelişim:** Bebek havuzundaki her bireyin bütün yeteneklerini ortaya çıkarabilmesi için tasarlanmış bir eğitim sistemi, teorik olarak bireysel yeteneklerin en iyi şekilde geliştirilmesine yardımcı olabilir. Ancak, bu sistemin uygulanması, tüm bireylerin farklılıklarını ve benzersiz ihtiyaçlarını dikkate alması gerekecektir. Sonuç olarak, bu tür bir medeniyet inşası, insan hakları, bireysel özgürlükler ve etik değerler açısından önemli sorunlar ve zorluklar barındırır. Herkes için fırsat eşitliği sağlama hedefi takdir edilse de, amaçlara ulaşmak için kullanılan yöntemler ve araçlar tartışmaya açıktır. Bu, daha geniş bir etik, felsefi ve politik diyalog gerektiren karmaşık bir konudur."},{"prompt":"aslında yukarıdaki ilke aşağıdaki şiirin merkez ve omurgasıdır: şimdi de ilk soru ve cevabı da dikkate alarak bir bütün olarak bu şiirin tamamını bir insanlık projesi olarak analiz et: bu satırlardaki ilkelerle nasıl bir medeniyet inşa edebiliriz: öleceksiniz, demiş tanrı: ölmeden mezarlara mı girelim? her an'ımızı korkuyla mı geçirelim? hayır, biz ölümsüzlüğü arayacağız atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde hayır, biz hayatın tadına varacağız kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde gün doğumunda ve gün batımında hayranlık içinde seyredeceğiz doğayı şarkılar söyleyip dans edeceğiz çırılçıplak, ne utanma ne çekince engellilerin yüzlerine öpücükler konduracak güzeller yakışıklılar salıncaklarda sallayacak neşeli çocuklar sarhoş şairleri cenneti büyütüp cehennemi küçülteceğiz bu evrende aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği öyle ki gerçekleştirsinler özgürce kendilerini olimpiyat ruhu kuşatmalı her alandaki rekabeti ödül de ceza da adalet de ölümden önce gelmeli tanrının boyunduruğunda sonsuz bir hayat değil tanrısız tek bir nefes isteriz, desin insanlık.","completion":"Bu şiir ve ona dayanan ilke, insanlık için idealize edilmiş bir medeniyeti tasavvur eder. Merkezinde özgürlük, eşitlik, adalet, bireysel gelişim ve insanlığın genel refahı yatan bir vizyondur. Şiirden hareketle inşa edilebilecek medeniyetin temel yapı taşları aşağıdaki gibi olabilir: 1. **Özgür Bir Toplum:** Şiir, insanların özgürce yaşadığı, korku ve endişeden arınmış bir toplum özlemini dile getiriyor. Ölümsüzlüğü, metaforik anlamda, atomun ve uzayın derinliklerinde aramak, insanlığın bilim ve keşif yoluyla sınırlarını zorlaması gerektiğini vurgular. Bu, sadece fiziksel ve keşfedici bilimlerde değil, felsefe, sanat ve edebiyatta da geçerlidir. Kitapların ve vücutların mürekkebinde hayatın tadına varmak, yaşamın her yönünü kucaklamak anlamına gelir. 2. **Doğa ve Sanatla Uyum:** Doğaya hayranlıkla bakmak ve müzik, dans gibi sanatsal ifade biçimlerini serbestçe kullanmak, bu medeniyetin estetik ve doğa ile barışık olduğunu gösterir. İnsanların doğal dünyayı ve sanatın değişik biçimlerini takdir etme kapasiteleri, toplumun ruh sağlığını ve genel mutluluğunu artırır. 3. **Toplumsal Eşitlik ve Destek:** Engellilere ve toplumun diğer üyelerine gösterilen sevgi ve saygı, bu medeniyetin birlik ve dayanışma anlayışını simgeler. Böylesi bir dünya, bireylerin birbirlerini desteklediği, kimsenin fiziksel ya da zihinsel durumu nedeniyle dışlanmadığı veya ayrımcılığa uğramadığı bir toplumda yaşamayı hayal eder. 4. **Fırsat Eşitliği:** Şiir, \\"aynı gün rahme düşen bebeklere fırsat eşitliği\\" ilkesini öne sürerek, tüm bireylerin eşit başlangıç koşullarına sahip olduğu bir toplumu savunur. Bu, eğitim, sağlık hizmetleri ve diğer yaşamsal kaynaklara adil erişimi içerir. Böyle bir medeniyet, her bir bireyin potansiyelini en üst düzeye çıkarmayı amaçlar. 5. **Hakça Yarışma ve Adalet:** Olimpiyat ruhunun her alandaki rekabeti kuşatmasının istenmesi, yarışmanın adil ve dürüst olması gerektiğini vurgular. Ödül, ceza ve adaletin, ölümden önce ve hayatın içinde somut ve adil bir şekilde uygulanması gerektiğini belirtir. 6. **Maddi ve Manevi Bağımsızlık:** Şiir, \\"tanrısız tek bir nefes isteriz\\" diyerek, bireylerin manevi ve maddi bağımsızlık içinde yaşamaları gerektiğini savunur. Bu, insanların bir yüksek güçten korku ve umutla değil, kendi kararları ve ahlaki değerleriyle yaşaması gerektiğini öne sürer. Bu şiirin önerdiği medeniyet, insan onurunu ve bireyselliği korurken, toplumsal eşitliği, adaleti ve desteği merkeze alır. Bu, bireysel özgürlüklerle toplumsal sorumluluk arasında dengeli bir ilişki kurmayı hedefleyen, hem derinlikli hem de kapsayıcı bir insanlık projesidir."},{"prompt":"How can I fix this: Error: unable to connect to Podman socket: failed to connect: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:49813: connect: connection refused","completion":"This error occurs when the Podman socket is unable to establish a connection on the specified IP address and port.

To fix the error, change the function signature of \`process_single_token_entity\` by moving parameters without default values to the front, like so: \`\`\`python def process_single_token_entity(self, dataframe, entity, entity_name, section, threshold=75): \`\`\` This adjustment ensures that parameters with default values come after those without, adhering to Python's requirements for function definitions.

What measurments are needed?","completion":"Creating a sleeved leotard involves quite a few measurements to ensure a good fit, especially if designing from scratch. Here is a comprehensive list of measurements you might need for drafting a pattern for a sleeved leotard. Remember, accuracy is key when taking these measurements. 1. **Bust/Chest**: Measure around the fullest part of the chest, keeping the measuring tape under the arms and around the shoulder blades. 2. **Waist**: Measure around the natural waistline, which is the narrowest part of the torso, usually about an inch above the belly button. 3. **Hips**: Measure around the widest part of the hips and buttocks. 4. **Girth/Torso**: This is a critical measurement for leotards. Measure from the shoulder, down through the legs, and back up to the same shoulder, drawing the tape measure snugly against the body to ensure a good fit. 5. **Upper Bust**: Measure directly under the arms, around the body, and above the bust. 6. **Under Bust**: Measure around the body, just under the bust. 7. **Sleeve Length**: Measure from the shoulder edge, through the slightly bent elbow, to the wrist or desired length of the sleeve. 8. **Armhole Depth**: This can be determined by measuring from the top outside edge of the shoulder down to the underarm. 9. **Bicep**: Measure around the fullest part of the bicep with the arm slightly bent. 10. **Wrist**: Measure around the wrist for the sleeve's end, if applicable (for tight-fitting sleeves). 11. **Shoulder to Shoulder**: Measure across the back from one shoulder to the other. 12. **Back Waist Length**: Measure from the most prominent bone at the base of the neck down to the natural waistline. 13. **Front Waist Length**: Measure from the shoulder at the base of the neck, over the fullest part of the bust, to the waistline. 14. **Arm Length (for set-in sleeves)**: Measure from the top of the shoulder, over a slightly bent elbow, to where you want the sleeve to end. 15. **Front Neck to Waist**: Measure from the base of the neck in front, down to the waistline. Taking all these measurements carefully will help you create a leotard pattern that fits the body precisely. Depending on the style of the leotard (e.g., if it has a low scoop back, high neck, etc.), you might need to adjust where you take some of these measurements or take additional ones to ensure complete coverage and comfort. Always perform a fit test with a mock-up before constructing the final garment to allow for any necessary adjustments."},{"prompt":"Draft a pattern for front buttoned shirt, wasting as little material as possible...","completion":"Drafting a pattern for a front-buttoned shirt while minimizing fabric waste requires careful planning and efficient use of fabric. The process outlined here is a simplified guide meant to help you create a basic shirt pattern. This guide assumes you have some knowledge about pattern making and sewing. For a more efficient use of fabric, consider using a fabric width that matches well with the total width of your pattern pieces, typically 45 inches (114.3 cm) or 60 inches (152.4 cm). # Tools and Materials Needed: - Measuring Tape - Pattern Paper (or any large paper) - Pencil - Ruler (preferably a clear one) - French curve (helpful for armholes and collars) - Scissors - Fabric (yardage will depend on the shirt size and width of the fabric) # Basic Measurements Needed: 1. **Chest/Bust**: Around the fullest part. 2. **Waist**: At the narrowest point. 3. **Hip**: Around the widest point of the hips. 4. **Shoulder Width**: From one shoulder's edge to the other. 5. **Sleeve Length**: From the shoulder edge to the desired end point at the wrist, or shorter for different styles. 6. **Shirt Length**: From the highest shoulder point (HSP) down to the desired bottom edge of the shirt. 7. **Neck Circumference**: Around the base of the neck. # Drafting the Pattern: **Front and Back (Same Pattern, Altered for Front Opening and Neckline):** 1. **Start with the Back**: Draw a rectangle using the chest/bust measurement for the width (divide the measurement by 4 and add ease and seam allowances) and the shirt length for the height. Adjust the width at the waist and hip if necessary for a better fit, adding 1-2 inches of ease and seam allowances. 2. **Shoulder Slope**: From the top corner, measure down the shoulder length and draw the shoulder line sloping downwards towards the neck. 3. **Neckline**: Back neckline can be a simple curve. For the front piece, adjust the pattern by lowering the front neckline based on your design (establish a center front line and make it a button placket). 4. **Armhole**: Draw the armhole curve using the shoulder point as a guide. A French curve is helpful here. 5. **Side Seams**: Shape the side seams if necessary, tapering in at the waist and back out at the hips. **Sleeves:** 6. **Draft the Sleeve**: The sleeve length plus cap height determines the sleeve length. Use the armhole depth to draw the cap of the sleeve. **Collar and Cuff (If Applicable):** 7. **Collar**: The neck circumference measurement will guide the length of the collar. Draft a simple collar pattern. The collar can be a standard point, spread, or button-down, depending on the style. 8. **Cuff**: Measure the wrist and draft a rectangle that will wrap around it, add plackets. **Minimizing Fabric Waste:** - **Lay Out All Pieces Tightly**: Arrange all pieces in close proximity on your paper first to see how they can be nested before cutting on fabric. - **Use Length Wisely**: Position larger patterns along the fabric's length and slot smaller pieces like cuffs and collars in between or along the edges. - **Consider Sleeve and Torso Length**: Adjust pattern pieces to fit across the fabric width if using a standard fabric width, to minimize offcuts. **Assembly Tips:** - Construct a muslin or test garment to adjust the fit before cutting your final fabric. - Mark all notches, grainlines, and buttonholes on your pattern for easier assembly. # Final Note: This guide gives a very basic outline for drafting a front-buttoned shirt pattern. Many variations in button plackets, collar styles, and fitting adjustments are possible based on personal preference and body shape. Pattern making and garment construction books can provide more detailed instructions and variations. Also, practicing and experimenting with scrap fabric before committing to your final fabric can save materials and help refine your skills."},{"prompt":"{SNOW BIOME - TERRARIA} Mechanic: \\"Hey, [player]?

Dependendo do método escolhido para selecionar essa parte, a amostragem pode ser classificada em duas grandes categorias: probabilística e não probabilística. # Amostragem Probabilística A amostragem probabilística é caracterizada pelo fato de cada membro da população ter uma chance conhecida e diferente de zero de ser selecionado para a amostra. Isso implica que a seleção é baseada em elementos aleatórios, garantindo, teoricamente, a representatividade da amostra. Alguns métodos comuns de amostragem probabilística incluem: - **Amostragem Aleatória Simples**: cada membro da população tem a mesma chance de ser escolhido. Pode ser feita com reposição (o elemento volta à população e pode ser escolhido novamente) ou sem reposição (uma vez escolhido, não retorna à população). - **Amostragem Sistemática**: após ordenar a população, seleciona-se um elemento a cada 'k' intervalos. Por exemplo, em uma população de 1000 elementos, deseja-se uma amostra de 100; então, escolhe-se um elemento aleatório entre 1 e 10 e, a partir dele, a cada 10 elementos, outro é selecionado. - **Amostragem Estratificada**: a população é dividida em subgrupos (estratos) que são homogêneos internamente, mas heterogêneos entre si, e a seleção dos elementos é feita aleatoriamente dentro de cada estrato. Essa divisão pode ser feita com base em características como idade, sexo, região geográfica, etc. - **Amostragem por Conglomerados**: ao contrário da estratificada, aqui a população é dividida em grupos heterogêneos internamente, mas semelhantes entre si. A amostra é obtida pela escolha aleatória de um ou mais desses grupos, chamados de conglomerados, e investigando todos os membros dentro deles. # Amostragem Não Probabilística Na amostragem não probabilística, a seleção dos elementos da amostra não se baseia em uma probabilidade conhecida ou igual para todos os membros da população, muitas vezes envolvendo algum grau de subjetividade. Alguns dos métodos não probabilísticos incluem: - **Amostragem por Conveniência**: escolhe-se elementos para a amostra porque são fáceis de acessar ou voluntários. - **Amostragem por Julgamento**: a seleção é feita com base no conhecimento prévio do pesquisador sobre a população, escolhendo-se os casos que ele considera mais representativos ou informativos. - **Amostragem por Cotas**: semelhante à amostragem estratificada, mas a seleção dentro de cada estrato não é feita aleatoriamente. Em vez disso, o pesquisador preenche cotas com base em critérios específicos. - **Amostragem de Bola de Neve**: usada principalmente quando a população de estudo é difícil de acessar. Uma vez que alguns membros são identificados, eles ajudam a recrutar mais participantes dentre seus contatos. # Considerações A escolha entre amostragem probabilística e não probabilística tem implicações importantes quanto à validade e generalização dos resultados. A amostragem probabilística é geralmente preferida para pesquisas quantitativas, pois permite estimativas mais precisas e a aplicação de inferências estatísticas. No entanto, em contextos onde a população é difícil de ser definida ou acessada, ou quando o objetivo é exploratório, a amostragem não probabilística pode ser mais prática ou adequada. É vital que pesquisadores tenham claro o método de amostragem escolhido, suas limitações e implicações para os resultados e conclusões de seus estudos."},{"prompt":"всё ли я верно понял и написал? речь идёт о принципах solid *S* (\`single responsibility principle\`) 1 сущность выполняет 1 действие (чтобы не перенагружать код, быть способным к расширению).

Вместо того чтобы пихать всё в один интерфейс лучше максимально декомпозировать сущности. Так, например, если у нас есть интерфейс *weapon* и у него есть методы *attack* и *reload*, то лучше создать интерфейс *attacker* и *reloader*, к которым будут имплементироваться оружия D (\`Dependency inversion principle\`) *Модули верхних уровней* не должны зависеть от *модулей нижних уровней*. А оба из них должны зависеть от [[Интерфейсы и абстрактные классы|абстракций]]. А [[Интерфейсы и абстрактные классы|абстракции]] не должны зависеть от *деталей*. В качестве примера возьмём ситуацию, когда на заводе внутри станка сломалась какая-то деталь. Заменив эту деталь теперь работником требуется переучиваться, а также возможно регулировать подачу электропитания. Если руководствоваться данным нам принципом, то лучше создать абстракции в виде трансформатора и пульта управления. Тогда трансформатор покроет издержки электропитания, а работников не надо будет переучивать, нужно будет лишь настроить пульт управления на новую деталь","completion":"В целом, вы верно описали принципы SOLID, однако есть несколько моментов, которые стоит уточнить или дополнить для большей точности: # S (Single Responsibility Principle) - Ваше определение понятия \\"1 сущность выполняет 1 действие\\" стоит уточнить. Принцип одной ответственности гласит, что класс должен иметь одну и только одну причину для изменения. Это не всегда сводится к одному действию, а скорее к одной области ответственности. Например, класс \`UserManager\` может иметь методы для добавления, удаления и поиска пользователя, и всё это будет в рамках одной ответственности - управления пользователями. - Также деление на модель и поведение - это не всегда чёткое следование SRP. Модели могут иметь методы, действующие непосредственно в контексте данных модели, и это тоже может быть в рамках SRP. # O (Open-Closed Principle) - В вашем описании этого принципа всё верно. Важно понимать, что расширение функциональности должно происходить без изменения существующего кода, чтобы не нарушать работу текущих систем. # L (Liskov Substitution Principle) - Ваше объяснение верно. Важно, чтобы подклассы могли служить заменой своим базовым классам без изменения правильности программы. # I (Interface Segregation Principle) - Принцип разделения интерфейса хорошо объяснён. Действительно, системы лучше строить с использованием узконаправленных интерфейсов, чем с одним \\"тяжёлым\\", содержащим слишком много несвязанных методов. # D (Dependency Inversion Principle) - Здесь также всё верно описано. Важно отметить, что основная идея – это снижение зависимости высокоуровневых модулей от низкоуровневых реализаций через абстракции. Это позволяет сделать систему более гибкой и упрощает её модификацию. Общее замечание: ваши объяснения сосредотачиваются на основных идеях, что является правильным подходом для введения в принципы SOLID. однако, в некоторых местах возможны уточнения или небольшие корректировки формулировок для более точного отражения сути принципов."},{"prompt":"Hi chat, a quick question...

Would that be helpful or rather distracting at first? Would there be benefits learning to use a different OS? Would that further his career or hinder it?","completion":"Whether an average Joe should consider changing to a different operating system when learning coding depends on several factors, including their goals, interests, and level of comfort with technology. Here are some considerations to keep in mind: 1. **Familiarity vs. Learning Curve**: If an individual is already comfortable using their current operating system (e.g., Windows or macOS) and has access to the necessary development tools and resources, they may not need to switch to a different OS to start learning coding. Switching to a new OS could introduce a learning curve and potentially be distracting initially. 2. **Compatibility and Availability of Tools**: Different operating systems have their own set of development tools, libraries, and environments that are commonly used by developers. For example, many developers use macOS or Linux for web development, while Windows is often used for .NET development. It's important to consider the compatibility and availability of the tools required for the specific coding languages or projects the individual is interested in. 3. **Exposure to Different Environments**: Learning to code on a different operating system can provide exposure to new tools, workflows, and development environments. This can broaden the individual's skillset and understanding of different technologies, which can be beneficial for their career in the long run. 4. **Career Impact**: For some career paths or industries, familiarity with multiple operating systems and development environments can be an asset. Being proficient in Linux, for example, is valuable for roles in system administration, cybersecurity, or cloud computing. However, for most programming roles, the choice of operating system is less important than mastering coding fundamentals and problem-solving skills. In summary, while learning to code on a different operating system can offer benefits such as exposure to new technologies and development workflows, it's not always necessary and may initially be more distracting than helpful for beginners.

Pour une approche plus avancée et dynamique, envisagez d'utiliser \`@HostBinding\` ou NgClass avec des conditions. **Alerte Component** Pour le composant d’alerte, vous pourriez créer un composant qui affiche un message avec divers états (succès, avertissement, erreur, etc.). 1. **Composant HTML (Exemple succinct)** : \`\`\`html <!-- src/app/alerte/alerte.component.html --> <div [ngClass]=\\"\`bg-{type}-100 border-l-4 border-{type}-500 text-{type}-700 p-4\`\\" role=\\"alert\\"> <p class=\\"font-bold\\">Attention</p> <p>{{ message }}</p> </div> \`\`\` 2. **Inputs du Composant** : \`\`\`typescript // src/app/alerte/alerte.component.ts @Input() message: string = 'Ceci est un message d'alerte !'; @Input() type: 'success' | 'warning' | 'danger' = 'success'; \`\`\` **Accordeon Component** L’implémentation de l’accordéon sera un petit peu plus complexe, car vous devrez gérer l’état d’ouverture/fermeture des différents panneaux. 1. **Accordeon HTML** (Exemple basique) : \`\`\`html <!-- src/app/accordeon/accordeon.component.html --> <div class=\\"p-2\\" *ngFor=\\"let item of items\\"> <button class=\\"bg-gray-300 p-2 w-full text-left\\" (click)=\\"toggle(item.id)\\"> {{ item.title }} </button> <div *ngIf=\\"isOpen(item.id)\\" class=\\"p-2 bg-gray-200\\"> {{ item.content }} </div> </div> \`\`\` 2. **Gestion de l'état dans le Composant** : \`\`\`typescript // src/app/accordeon/accordeon.component.ts export class AccordeonComponent { items = [ { id: 1, title: 'Titre 1', content: 'Contenu caché 1' }, // Ajoutez plus d'items ici ]; openItemId: number | null = null; toggle(itemId: number) { this.openItemId = this.openItemId === itemId ? null : itemId; } isOpen(itemId: number) { return this.openItemId === itemId; } } \`\`\` # Étape 5: Ajouter des stories à Storybook (Complément) Pour chaque composant créé : Pour ajouter une story pour un bouton par exemple, vous iriez dans le fichier de stories de ce composant (\`src/app/bouton/bouton.stories.ts\`) puis définiriez plusieurs états ou variations de ce composant. - **Bouton Stories** : Vous utiliseriez les \`args\` pour passer les différentes props au composant et ainsi illustrer différentes versions du bouton (ex : primaire, secondaire, danger etc.) - **Alerte & Accordeon Stories** : Suivez le même principe que pour le bouton, en définissant des variations basées sur les props (\`type\` pour l'alerte, et différents \`items\` pour les accordéons). # Conclusion et Prochaines Étapes En suivant ces étapes, vous avez ajouté des composants de base à votre projet Angular, stylisés avec Tailwind et visible/testable via Storybook. L'aspect modulaire et la documentation intégrée de Storybook facilitent le partage de ces composants au sein de votre équipe et fournissent une référence visuelle pratique pour leur utilisation.

После интенсивной тренировки запасы гликогена в мышцах могут быть существенно исчерпаны, и быстрой углевод, такой как сахар, может быть эффективным способом для их пополнения. Потребление простых углеводов (к которым относится сахар) способствует быстрому повышению уровня глюкозы в крови и, как следствие, быстрому восполнению гликогена в мышцах. Это может быть особенно актуально для атлетов, которые занимаются несколько раз в день или имеют тесно расположенные по времени тренировки, когда время на восстановление ограничено. Тем не менее, использование сахара как источника углеводов после тренировки стоит рассматривать с учетом общих целей питания и здоровья. Для достижения более сбалансированного восстановления и питания, многие специалисты рекомендуют комбинировать простые углеводы с источниками белка и, возможно, некоторыми сложными углеводами, чтобы обеспечить не только восстановление гликогена, но и поддержку ремонта и роста мышечной ткани. Кроме того, при употреблении сахара после тренировки важно учитывать общее потребление сахара в течение дня, поскольку чрезмерное потребление добавленных сахаров может способствовать развитию различных заболеваний, включая ожирение, тип 2 диабет и сердечно-сосудистые заболевания. В общем, сахар может быть полезен для быстрого восполнения гликогена после тренировки, но его использование должно быть сбалансировано с другими питательными веществами и учитывать общие потребности и цели диеты."},{"prompt":"какое количество саха можно принимать при собственном весе 110 килограмм, с учётом того что я придерживаюсь кето-диеты","completion":"При соблюдении кето-диеты основное внимание уделяется минимизации углеводов в рационе для поддержания состояния кетоза, при котором организм использует жиры в качестве основного источника энергии, а не глюкозу. В среднем, для поддержания кетоза рекомендуется потреблять не более 20-50 граммов чистых углеводов в день, хотя точное количество может варьироваться в зависимости от индивидуальных факторов, таких как метаболическая гибкость, уровень физической активности и индивидуальные метаболические особенности. С учетом этого, потребление сахара в рамках кето-диеты должно быть крайне ограничено или исключено, поскольку сахар является высококонцентрированным источником углеводов, который может быстро превысить допустимый дневной лимит и вывести организм из состояния кетоза. Если ваш вес составляет 110 килограмм и вы придерживаетесь кето-диеты, важно сосредоточиться на потреблении углеводов, в основном поступающих из низкоуглеводных овощей, орехов и семян в количествах, которые позволяют вам оставаться в состоянии кетоза. Принимая во внимание общую необходимость соблюдения диеты с низким содержанием углеводов, любое добавление сахара в рацион должно быть тщательно взвешено против вашего ежедневного лимита углеводов и, вероятно, должно быть очень ограничено или исключено для поддержания кетоза. В заключение, если вы строго следуете кето-диете, предпочтительнее избегать потребления сахара и сосредоточиться на потреблении питательных веществ из цельных и низкоуглеводных продуктов. Для индивидуальных рекомендаций стоит проконсультироваться с диетологом или специалистом по кето-диете."},{"prompt":"что касаемо периода непосредственно после силовой тренировки?","completion":"После силовой тренировки основная цель состоит в поддержке восстановления мышц и пополнении уровня гликогена. Для людей, не придерживающихся кето-диеты, часто рекомендуется потребление углеводов в сочетании с белками для ускорения этих процессов. Однако при соблюдении кето-диеты подход должен быть другим, учитывая ограничения на углеводы. Даже при кето-диете, важно понимать, что непосредственно после тренировки организм может более эффективно использовать углеводы для восполнения гликогена, не влияя сильно на состояние кетоза, особенно после интенсивных и высокоинтенсивных тренировок, которые истощают запасы гликогена. Этот феномен известен как \\"окно восстановления\\". Для людей на кето-диете, которые хотят воспользоваться этим \\"окном восстановления\\" после силовой тренировки, может быть приемлемо потреблять небольшое количество быстрых углеводов в сочетании с белком. Однако, это количество должно быть строго контролируемым, чтобы не вывести организм из состояния кетоза. Как правило, это означает ограничение углеводов в рамках общего ежедневного лимита, поддерживаемого для кетоза (20-50 грамм в день для большинства людей). Итак, даже после тренировки, следует очень осторожно добавлять углеводы, исходя из индивидуальной углеводной толерантности и способности сохранять кетоз. В этот период можно обратить внимание на такие источники углеводов, как авокадо, ягоды или овощи с низким содержанием углеводов, которые также будут способствовать восстановлению и питанию, не превышая углеводные ограничения кето-диеты. В заключение, даже при соблюдении кето-диеты и общем стремлении к минимизации употребления углеводов, некоторая гибкость в их потреблении сразу после силовой тренировки может быть оправдана для поддержки восстановления, при этом очень важно не превышать общее суточное количество углеводов, чтобы поддерживать кетоз. Однако для индивидуальных рекомендаций и точного планирования рациона лучше всего проконсультироваться с диетологом или специалистом по кетогенной диете."},{"prompt":"потребность в каких микронутриентах выше всего после силовой тренировки, и какой вид сухофруктов содержащий достаточное количество углеводов был бы предпочтительней для восполнения дефицита данных микронутриентов и гликогена за счёт содержащихся углеводов в этом виде сухофруктов?","completion":"После силовой тренировки важна не только быстрая подпитка углеводами для восстановления гликогена, но и восполнение микронутриентов, которые помогают в восстановлении, регенерации тканей и общем улучшении здоровья. Основные микронутриенты, на которые следует обратить внимание после тренировки, включают: 1. **Магний** - помогает сокращению и расслаблению мышц, поддерживает энергетический метаболизм. 2. **Калий** - важен для гидратации, нервной функции и мышечного сокращения. 3. **Железо** - ключевой компонент для производства гемоглобина и транспорта кислорода. 4. **Цинк** - поддерживает иммунную систему, важен для процесса заживления и роста тканей. 5. **Антиоксиданты** (Витамин C, E, Селен) - помогают бороться с оксидативным стрессом от интенсивных тренировок. По поводу сухофруктов, они действительно могут быть хорошим вариантом для быстрого восполнения уровня гликогена за счет содержащихся углеводов, однако стоит учитывать, что многие сухофрукты высококалорийны и содержат много сахара, так что их потребление следует дозировать. **Финики** могут быть одним из лучших вариантов сухофруктов после тренировки, поскольку: - Они богаты углеводами, что поможет быстро восполнить энергетические запасы. - Содержат калий, магний и даже небольшое количество железа. - У фиников высокий гликемический индекс, что делает их полезными для быстрого восстановления уровня глюкозы в крови после тренировок. Важно помнить, что хоть финики и полезны с точки зрения быстрой энергии и микронутриентов, их потребление следует сбалансировать с другими источниками питательных веществ, особенно белка, для оптимального восстановления после тренировки. Напомню, что важно учитывать индивидуальную переносимость и диетические ограничения, поэтому перед внесением любых значительных изменений в рацион лучше всего проконсультироваться с диетологом или врачом."},{"prompt":"сколько углеводов содержится в финиках и какой у них гликемический индекс?","completion":"Финики считаются высокоуглеводными фруктами. В среднем, 100 граммов фиников содержат около 75 граммов углеводов, из которых большая часть приходится на натуральные сахара (глюкоза, фруктоза и сахароза). Это делает финики отличным источником быстро усваиваемых углеводов, что полезно для быстрого восстановления энергетических запасов после тренировки. Гликемический индекс (ГИ) фиников варьируется и может зависеть от их сорта и степени зрелости, но в среднем он находится в диапазоне от 42 до 55. Это считается средним или умеренным уровнем. Гликемический индекс - это мера того, насколько быстро углеводы в пище повышают уровень глюкозы в крови. Несмотря на высокое содержание сахара, умеренный ГИ фиников обусловлен также наличием волокон, которые замедляют усвоение сахаров и смягчают их влияние на уровень сахара в крови. Важно отметить, что употребление фиников хоть и является эффективным способом для быстрого восполнения уровня гликогена и энергии после тренировок, должно быть сбалансировано с другими аспектами питания, особенно если у вас есть определенные заболевания (например, диабет) или цели по контролю веса, так как финики довольно калорийны."},{"prompt":"перепроверь данные касаемо гликемического индекса фиников","completion":"Извините за путаницу в предыдущем ответе. Позвольте уточнить информацию о гликемическом индексе (ГИ) фиников. Финики действительно имеют относительно высокий гликемический индекс, который может варьироваться в зависимости от сорта фиников и их обработки. В общем, ГИ фиников может находиться в диапазоне от 35 до 70. Это означает, что для некоторых людей употребление фиников может привести к более резкому повышению уровня глюкозы в крови, чем предполагалось в моем предыдущем ответе. Важно учитывать, что несмотря на высокий ГИ, финики также содержат пищевые волокна, которые могут помогать замедлить абсорбцию сахара и, как следствие, смягчить воздействие на уровень глюкозы в крови. Однако, при введении фиников в рацион, особенно в контексте конкретных диетических целей или при сахарном диабете, важно учитывать их ГИ и общее содержание сахара. Перепроверка этих данных подчеркивает важность учета индивидуальных реакций на различные продукты и их воздействие на метаболизм каждого человека. Всегда рекомендуется проконсультироваться со специалистом в области питания или вашим лечащим врачом, прежде чем вносить значительные изменения в ваш рацион, особенно при наличии хронических состояний здоровья."},{"prompt":"сколько микронутриентов содержится в финиках и какой сорт самый богатый на них?","completion":"Финики являются ценным источником микронутриентов, включая витамины и минералы, которые играют важную роль в поддержании здоровья и общего благополучия. Ниже приведен список некоторых ключевых микронутриентов, обычно содержащихся в финиках: - **Витамин B6 (пиридоксин)**: необходим для метаболизма аминокислот и производства нейромедиаторов. - **Магний**: участвует в более чем 300 биохимических процессах в организме, включая поддержку функций мышц и нервной системы, а также помогает регулировать уровни глюкозы в крови и артериальное давление. - **Калий**: способствует поддержанию нормального кровяного давления, регулирует баланс жидкости в организме и необходим для нервной функции и мышечных сокращений. - **Медь**: важна для производства красных кровяных телец и поддержания здоровья нервной системы. - **Селен**: мощный антиоксидант, играющий ключевую роль в поддержании метаболизма и здоровья иммунной системы. - **Железо**: важно для производства гемоглобина и транспорта кислорода в организме. Что касается сорта, то существует множество различных типов фиников, и их питательный состав может незначительно отличаться. Однако, одним из наиболее популярных и широко доступных сортов являются финики Меджул. Финики Меджул отличаются крупным размером, сочностью и сладостью. Они также богаты питательными веществами, включая микронутриенты, упомянутые выше. Хотя финики Меджул могут содержать немного больше микронутриентов по сравнению с некоторыми другими сортами из-за их большего размера и насыщенности, разница может быть несущественной, и выбор определенного сорта часто зависит от личных предпочтений во вкусе и текстуре. В любом случае, финики являются отличным и полезным дополнением к рациону, предлагая разнообразие микронутриентов вместе с быстрой энергией углеводов. Тем не менее, из-за высокого содержания сахара и калорий их стоит употреблять в умеренных количествах."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In the example above, for duplicate filenames, it appends \\"_Duplicate_\\" followed by a sequence number (starting from 1). Adjust this logic based on how you wish to rename your files. - **Environment**: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to rename files in the directory.

One way to do this is to pre-process your keys and group them by slot using a technique like \\"hash tags.\\" Here's an example that demonstrates how you can group keys using hash tags to ensure they map to the same slot: \`\`\`python import redis redis_host = 'your_redis_host' redis_port = 'your_redis_port' password = 'your_redis_password' ssl_cert_reqs = None redis_client = redis.Redis( host=redis_host, port=redis_port, password=password, ssl=True, ssl_cert_reqs=ssl_cert_reqs, decode_responses=True ) def group_keys_by_slot(keys): grouped_keys = {} for key in keys: hash_tag_start = key.find('{') if hash_tag_start != -1: hash_tag_end = key.find('}', hash_tag_start) slot = abs(hash(key[hash_tag_start + 1:hash_tag_end])) % 16384 # Assuming 16384 slots in Redis Cluster grouped_keys.setdefault(slot, []).append(key) else: slot = abs(hash(key)) % 16384 grouped_keys.setdefault(slot, []).append(key) return grouped_keys def get_values(redis_client, keys): grouped_keys = group_keys_by_slot(keys) values = [] for slot, key_group in grouped_keys.items(): values.extend(redis_client.mget(key_group)) return values # Example using scan_iter to iterate over keys for key in redis_client.scan_iter(): try: value = get_values(redis_client, [key]) print(f\\"Key: {key}, Value: {value}\\") except redis.exceptions.ResponseError as e: print(f\\"Error accessing key {key}: {e}\\") \`\`\` In this code, we define a function \`group_keys_by_slot\` that groups keys by slot using hash tags. This ensures that keys that need to be accessed together are within the same slot, preventing the \\"CROSSSLOT\\" error. Please modify the hashing logic according to your Redis Cluster setup and use case. This approach should help you overcome the issue of keys not hashing to the same slot in Redis Cluster operations."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"i have a list of strings and i would like to check a larger string if it contains each one separately, because some strings are sub-strings of others. how can i do this succinctly in js?","completion":"You can achieve this by iterating over the list of strings and checking if each string is a substring of the larger string. Here's a succinct way to do this in JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript const largerString = \\"This is a larger string that contains sub-strings\\"; const listOfStrings = [\\"larger\\", \\"contains\\", \\"sub-string\\", \\"other\\"]; const results = listOfStrings.map(subString => largerString.includes(subString)); console.log(results); \`\`\` In the above code: - \`largerString\` is the larger string in which we want to check for substrings. - \`listOfStrings\` is an array containing the list of strings that we want to check as substrings in the larger string. - \`map\` function is used to iterate over each string in the \`listOfStrings\` array. - \`includes\` function is used to check if the \`largerString\` contains the current string as a substring. - The result is an array of boolean values indicating whether each string is found as a substring in the larger string. This code will give you an array of boolean values, where \`true\` indicates that the corresponding string is found in the larger string, and \`false\` indicates that it is not found. Feel free to modify the code based on your specific requirements."},{"prompt":"no, some of the members of listOfStrings are sub-strings of each other","completion":"If some of the members of the \`listOfStrings\` are sub-strings of each other, you can first sort the list in descending order by string length. Then, you can iterate over the sorted list and check if each string is a substring of the larger string. Here's an example in JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript const largerString = \\"This is a larger string that contains sub-strings\\"; const listOfStrings = [\\"larger\\", \\"contains\\", \\"sub-string\\", \\"other\\"]; // Sort the list in descending order by string length const sortedList = listOfStrings.sort((a, b) => b.length - a.length); // Function to check if a string is a sub-string of another string const isSubString = (string, largerString) => largerString.includes(string); const results = sortedList.map(subString => isSubString(subString, largerString)); console.log(results); \`\`\` In this code snippet: - We first sort the \`listOfStrings\` array in descending order based on string length using the \`sort\` method. - We define the \`isSubString\` function that checks if a given \`string\` is a sub-string of \`largerString\`. - We then iterate over the sorted list and check if each string is a sub-string of the \`largerString\`. - The \`results\` array will contain boolean values indicating whether each string is found as a sub-string in the \`largerString\`. By sorting the list by string length and checking for sub-strings sequentially, you can ensure that the sub-strings are properly detected without interference from other overlapping sub-strings. This approach should help you handle cases where some strings are sub-strings of each other within the list."},{"prompt":"i would like to remove each found string from the larger string after each check","completion":"If you want to remove each found string from the larger string after each check, you can update the \`largerString\` variable by replacing each found sub-string with an empty string. Here's an example in JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript let largerString = \\"This is a larger string that contains sub-strings\\"; let listOfStrings = [\\"larger\\", \\"contains\\", \\"sub-string\\", \\"other\\"]; const sortedList = listOfStrings.sort((a, b) => b.length - a.length); const isSubString = (string, largerString) => largerString.includes(string); sortedList.forEach(subString => { if (isSubString(subString, largerString)) { console.log(\`Removing sub-string: {subString}\`); largerString = largerString.replace(new RegExp(subString, 'g'), ''); } }); console.log(\\"Remaining larger string:\\", largerString); \`\`\` In this code: - We iterate over the sorted list of strings, and for each string, we check if it is a sub-string of the \`largerString\`. - If a sub-string is found, we log a message indicating its removal and update the \`largerString\` by replacing all occurrences of that sub-string with an empty string using the \`replace\` method. - After iterating over all the strings, we log the modified \`largerString\`, which will now contain the original string with all the found sub-strings removed. This approach allows you to remove each found string from the larger string after each check, ensuring that subsequent sub-strings are checked in the updated string.

I'm here to help!"},{"prompt":"i shouldnt have to divide","completion":"If you believe that you should not have to divide by a scalar to achieve the correct result in your Prometheus query, there might be a misunderstanding in the composition of your query or the data manipulation logic within it. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can take to investigate the issue: 1. Check the Query Composition: Ensure that your Prometheus query is structured correctly with the appropriate functions and operators. Make sure that the \`sum\` and \`increase\` functions are being applied to the correct metrics and labels. 2. Verify Data Alignment: Check that the data alignment and timestamp resolution of your metrics are consistent and aligned correctly for the operations you are performing. 3. Review Metric Aggregation: Double-check the metric aggregation and groupings within your query to confirm that you are aggregating the data at the desired level. 4. Evaluate Metric Range: Consider the range of the time series data being queried and the impact it may have on the calculation. Adjust the time range if needed. 5. Test Against Sample Data: If possible, test your query against a smaller set of sample data or a simplified scenario to isolate the issue and better understand the behavior of the query. If after reviewing these aspects you are still experiencing unexpected results in your Prometheus query without dividing by a scalar, you may need to provide more details on the specific query and data being utilized so that further assistance can be provided. Feel free to provide additional information or queries for further analysis."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"explain how the \`patsubst\` command works in a makefile","completion":"In a Makefile, the \`patsubst\` function is used to substitute or replace patterns in a list of strings. The basic syntax of the \`patsubst\` function in a Makefile is as follows: \`\`\` (patsubst pattern,replacement,text) \`\`\` - \`pattern\`: The pattern to search for in the \`text\`. - \`replacement\`: The replacement string for the \`pattern\`. - \`text\`: The input list of strings in which the substitution will be applied. The \`patsubst\` function scans the \`text\` for occurrences of the specified \`pattern\` and replaces them with the provided \`replacement\`. Here are some key points about how \`patsubst\` works in a Makefile: 1. **Pattern Matching**: The \`pattern\` in \`patsubst\` can include wildcard characters such as \`%\` (matches any sequence of characters) and \`?\` (matches any single character). Wildcards are used to define patterns that match parts of strings. 2. **Pattern Replacement**: When a match is found in the \`text\`, the matching substring is replaced with the specified \`replacement\`. 3. **Multiple Replacements**: The \`patsubst\` function can replace multiple occurrences of the \`pattern\` in the \`text\` with the \`replacement\`. 4. **Example**: \`\`\`makefile # Define a list of source files with .c extension sources := main.c helper.c utils.c # Use patsubst to replace .c with .o in the list of sources objects := (patsubst %.c, %.o, (sources)) # Output the resulting list of object files all_objects: @echo (objects) \`\`\` In this example, the \`patsubst %.c, %.o, (sources)\` statement substitutes the file extension \`.c\` with \`.o\` in each file name in the \`sources\` list. If the \`sources\` list contains \`main.c\`, \`helper.c\`, and \`utils.c\`, the resulting \`objects\` list will be \`main.o\`, \`helper.o\`, and \`utils.o\`. 5. **Conditional Pattern Matching**: The \`patsubst\` function can be helpful in scenarios where conditional pattern matching and substitution are required within Makefile recipes and variable assignments. By utilizing the \`patsubst\` function effectively in your Makefiles, you can perform pattern-based substitutions and transformations on lists of strings to automate build processes and handle file name transformations efficiently."},{"prompt":"Quel conseil pour les études en Master en informatique","completion":"1.

Например, вы можете использовать ext4 для /var и /home, а XFS для /srv. Каждая файловая система имеет свои сильные стороны и может быть оптимальной для определенных задач. Однако, следует учитывать, что при использовании разных файловых систем необходимо быть готовым к управлению различными настройками и процедурами обслуживания. Например, различные файловые системы могут иметь разные методы сжатия, алгоритмы проверки целостности данных и т.д. Поэтому, прежде чем принять решение использовать разные файловые системы для разных директорий, стоит хорошо продумать и оценить преимущества и недостатки каждой из них в соответствии с требованиями и задачами вашей системы."},{"prompt":"Для сервера как лучше","completion":"Для сервера обычно используются файловые системы ext4 или XFS, в зависимости от специфики задач и требований к хранению данных. Основные различия между ext4 и XFS: 1. **Производительность**: XFS обычно обеспечивает лучшую производительность при работе с большими файловыми системами и большими файлами. В то время как ext4 имеет преимущество при работе с множеством маленьких файлов. 2. **Целостность данных**: Обе файловые системы обеспечивают хороший уровень защиты данных, но XFS может быть более надежной для крупных файловых систем из-за своих методов журналирования. 3. **Управление метаданными**: XFS имеет более эффективное управление метаданными и обработку параллельных операций, что может быть выгодно для серверного окружения. Итак, для сервера обычно рекомендуется использовать XFS, если ваши задачи связаны с обработкой больших объемов данных и файлов, а также если вам важна максимальная производительность и надежность. Однако, выбор между ext4 и XFS должен быть основан на конкретных требованиях и характеристиках ваших серверных приложений."},{"prompt":"Имею ввиду разделы по разному в сервере отформатировать или где то ext4 а где то xfs","completion":"Да, вы можете использовать различные файловые системы для разных разделов на сервере, в зависимости от целей использования и требований приложений. Например, для сервера вы можете использовать XFS для раздела, где хранятся данные, требующие быстрого доступа и обработки больших объемов информации. В то время как для раздела /var, где обычно хранятся логи и временные файлы, вы можете выбрать ext4. Каждая файловая система имеет свои особенности и предназначена для определенных задач. Поэтому, выбор между ext4 и XFS для разных разделов на сервере может быть обоснованным и поможет оптимизировать работу системы под конкретные требования. Однако, следует помнить о поддержке и удобстве управления различными файловыми системами на сервере. Убедитесь, что вы хорошо понимаете особенности каждой из них и учитываете возможные сложности при управлении и обслуживании файла системы на сервере."},{"prompt":"Luks2, minix, fat12 для чего","completion":"1. **LUKS2 (Linux Unified Key Setup)** - это стандарт для шифрования блочных устройств данных. LUKS используется для создания зашифрованных томов данных на Linux-системах. LUKS2 обеспечивает надежное шифрование данных и защиту информации на дисках от несанкционированного доступа. LUKS2 позволяет установить пароль или ключ шифрования для доступа к данным на зашифрованных томах. 2. **MINIX** - это простая и легковесная файловая система, разработанная для использования во встроенных системах и обучающих целях. MINIX обеспечивает надежное хранение и организацию файлов на диске, но обычно не используется в производственных серверных средах из-за его ограниченных возможностей и поддержки. 3. **FAT12 (File Allocation Table 12)** - это устаревшая файловая система, которая была широко используется в прошлом для форматирования съемных носителей, таких как дискеты.

При выборе файловой системы важно учитывать требования и задачи конкретного проекта или применения."},{"prompt":"Frases que fazem sentido e ao mesmo tempo não fazem","completion":"As frases que fazem e não fazem sentido ao mesmo tempo muitas vezes emergem do uso de paradoxos, ambiguidades e jogos de palavras. Aqui estão algumas frases que exemplificam bem essa característica: 1. \\"Eu sei que nada sei.\\" - Esta frase, atribuída a Sócrates, faz sentido porque expressa a humildade do conhecimento; no entanto, ao afirmar saber alguma coisa (\\"nada sei\\"), contradiz a própria afirmação. 2. \\"Menos é mais.\\" - Comumente usado no design e na arte, faz sentido ao sugerir que a simplicidade pode levar a um resultado superior. No entanto, literalmente falando, menos não pode ser mais. 3. \\"Esta frase é falsa.\\" - Se a frase é verdadeira, então ela é falsa, mas se é falsa, então é verdadeira. Faz e não faz sentido ao mesmo tempo, criando um paradoxo. 4. \\"Eu estou mentindo agora.\\" - Se você está mentindo, então você está dizendo a verdade, mas isso significaria que você não está mentindo. 5. \\"Silêncio é barulho.\\" - Faz sentido quando entendemos o \\"barulho\\" do silêncio como o peso ou a presença que ele pode ter. Literalmente, no entanto, silêncio e barulho são opostos e não podem ser a mesma coisa ao mesmo tempo. 6. \\"A única constante é a mudança.\\" - Faz sentido filosoficamente, sugerindo que tudo muda. No entanto, se a mudança é constante, então a constância existe na forma de mudança, o que parece ser um contrassenso. 7. \\"Eu sou ninguém.\\" - Faz sentido como uma declaração de humildade ou insignificância. No entanto, ao afirmar ser \\"ninguém\\", identifica-se como \\"alguém\\", criando uma contradição. 8. \\"O futuro já começou.\\" - Faz sentido ao sugerir que as ações de agora afetam o futuro. No entanto, se já começou, ele não é mais futuro, mas presente. Estas frases jogam com o significado e a lógica de forma que desafiam nossa compreensão usual, provocando reflexão e, às vezes, apreciação pelo absurdo."},{"prompt":"how does the patsubst command work in a makefile. give an example of its use","completion":"The patsubst command in a makefile is used to perform pattern substitution on a list of words. It takes three arguments: a pattern to search for, a replacement pattern, and a list of words to operate on. The syntax for the patsubst command is as follows: \`\`\`make (patsubst pattern,replacement,text) \`\`\` For example, let's say we have a list of source files in a variable called \`SRC\` and we want to replace the \`.c\` extension with a \`.o\` extension: \`\`\`make SRC := foo.c bar.c baz.c OBJ := (patsubst %.c,%.o,(SRC)) all: (OBJ) gcc -o myprogram (OBJ) \`\`\` In this example, the variable \`OBJ\` will be set to \`foo.o bar.o baz.o\` by replacing the \`.c\` extension with a \`.o\` extension in the list of source files specified in \`SRC\`.

This approach allows you to read the original CSV file, modify its content by adding the new column, and then write the updated content back to a file. Here's a step-by-step guide: # Step 1: Install Python Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python can handle CSV files directly using its standard library. # Step 2: Prepare Your CSV File Make sure your CSV file is properly formatted and accessible. For the purpose of this example, we'll assume your CSV file is named \`original.csv\`. # Step 3: Write the Python Script You'll write a script to read your original CSV file, add the new column, and save the result to a new file (or overwrite the original, if you prefer). Here's a sample script: \`\`\`python import csv input_file_name = 'original.csv' output_file_name = 'modified.csv' # Open the original CSV file for reading and the result file for writing with open(input_file_name, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as infile, open(output_file_name, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as outfile: # Create CSV reader and writer reader = csv.reader(infile) writer = csv.writer(outfile) # Read the first row (header) and add the new column headers = next(reader) headers.insert(1, 'NewColumn') # 'NewColumn' is the header for the new column writer.writerow(headers) # Process the rest of the rows for row in reader: # Insert the new column value ('mod') into the second position of each row row.insert(1, 'mod') writer.writerow(row) print(\\"File has been modified and saved as 'modified.csv'.\\") \`\`\` # Step 4: Run the Script - Save the script in a file, for instance, \`add_column.py\`. - Open a terminal or command prompt. - Navigate to the directory where your script and \`original.csv\` file are located. - Run the script using Python by executing the command \`python add_column.py\`. After running the script, you'll have a new file named \`modified.csv\` (or whatever you've chosen to name it) in the same directory, containing the original data with an added column named \\"NewColumn\\" (you can rename this to anything you like) as the second column, filled with the value \\"mod\\" for all rows. This technique allows for flexible modifications to CSV files and can be adapted to various similar tasks."},{"prompt":"{FOREST BIOME - TERRARIA} Guide \\"Y-You defeated Calamitas the Supreme Witch?

Now, I need your help to navigate through the Forest biome. Can you give me some tips on how to survive there?\\" Guide: \\"Of course, [player]. The Forest biome in Terraria can be a dangerous place, especially for beginners. Here are some tips to help you survive: 1. Watch out for aggressive creatures like slimes, zombies, and demon eyes. They can easily overwhelm you if you're not careful. 2. Collect resources like wood, stone, and herbs to craft tools, weapons, and potions to help you in your journey. 3. Explore the area carefully and look out for hidden treasures and loot in chests and underground tunnels. 4. Be prepared for nightfall when more dangerous enemies come out. Make sure you have torches, weapons, and armor to defend yourself. 5. Build a shelter or base to protect yourself from enemy attacks.

The Silent Valley “How agreeable and pleasant this valley is,” thought Milo as once again they bounced along the highway, with the Humbug humming snatches of old songs, to his own vast amusement, and Tock sniffing contentedly at the wind. “I really can’t see what Dr. Dischord was so concerned about; there certainly couldn’t be anything unpleasant along this road.” And just as the thought crossed his mind they passed through a heavy stone gateway and everything was very different. At first it was difficult to tell just what had changed—it all looked the same and it all smelled the same—but, for some reason, nothing sounded the same. “I wonder what’s happened?” said Milo. At least that’s what he tried to say, for, although his lips moved, not a sound came from his mouth. And suddenly he realized what it was, for Tock was no longer ticking and the Humbug, although happily singing, was doing so in complete silence. The wind no longer rustled the leaves, the car no longer squeaked, and the insects no longer buzzed in the fields. Not the slightest thing could be heard, and it felt as if, in some mysterious way, a switch had been thrown and all the sound in the world had been turned off at the same instant. The Humbug, suddenly realizing what had happened, leaped to his feet in terror, and Tock worriedly checked to see if he was still keeping time. It was certainly a strange feeling to know that no matter how loudly or softly you chatted or rattled or bumped, it all came out the same way—as nothing. “How dreadful,” thought Milo as he slowed down the car. The three of them began to talk and shout at once with absolutely no result until, hardly noticing where they were going, they had driven into the midst of a large crowd of people marching along the road. Some of them were singing at the tops of their nonexistent voices and the others were carrying large signs which proclaimed: DOWN WITH SILENCE ALL QUIET IS NO DIET IT’S LAUDABLE TO BE AUDIBLE MORE SOUND FOR ALL And one enormous banner stated simply: HEAR HERE Except for these, and the big brass cannon being pulled along behind, they all looked very much like the residents of any other small valley to which you’ve never been. When the car had stopped, one of them held up a placard which said: “WELCOME TO THE VALLEY OF SOUND.” And the others cheered as loudly as possible, which was not very loud at all. “HAVE YOU COME TO HELP US?” asked another, stepping forward with his question. “PLEASE!” added a third. Milo tried desperately to say who he was and where he was going, but to no avail. As he did, four more placards announced: LISTEN LOOK CAREFULLY AND WE WILL TELL YOU OF OUR TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE And while two of them held up a large blackboard, a third, writing as fast as he could, explained why there was nothing but quiet in the Valley of Sound. “At a place in the valley not far from here,” he began, \\"where the echoes used to gather and the winds came to rest, there is a great stone fortress, and in it lives the Soundkeeper, who rules this land. When the old king of Wisdom drove the demons into the distant mountains, he appointed her guardian of all sounds and noises, past, present, and future. “For years she ruled as a wise and beloved monarch, each morning at sunrise releasing the day’s new sounds, to be borne by the winds throughout the kingdom, and each night at moonset gathering in the old sounds, to be catalogued and filed in the vast storage vaults below.” The writer paused for a moment to mop his brow and then, since the blackboard was full, erased it completely and continued anew from the top. “She was generous to a fault and provided us with all the sound we could possibly use: for singing as we worked, for bubbling pots of stew, for the chop of an ax and the crash of a tree, for the creak of a hinge and the hoot of an owl, for the squish of a shoe in the mud and the friendly tapping of rain on the roof, and for the sweet music of pipes and the sharp snap of winter ice cracking on the ground.” He paused again as a tear of longing rolled from cheek to lip with the sweetsalty taste of an old memory. \\"And all these sounds, when once used, would be carefully placed in alphabetical order and neatly kept for future reference. Everyone lived in peace, and the valley flourished as the happy home of sound. But then things began to change. \\"Slowly at first, and then in a rush, more people came to settle here and brought with them new ways and new sounds, some very beautiful and some less so. But everyone was so busy with the things that had to be done that they scarcely had time to listen at all. And, as you know, a sound which is not heard disappears forever and is not to be found again. “People laughed less and grumbled more, sang less and shouted more, and the sounds they made grew louder and uglier. It became difficult to hear even the birds or the breeze, and soon everyone stopped listening for them.” He again cleared the blackboard, as the Humbug choked back a sob, and continued writing. \\"The Soundkeeper grew worried and disconsolate. Each day there were fewer sounds to be collected, and most of those were hardly worth keeping. Many people thought it was the weather, and others blamed the moon, but the general consensus of opinion held that the trouble began at the time that Rhyme and Reason were banished. But, no matter what the cause, no one knew what to do. \\"Then one day Dr. Dischord appeared in the valley with his wagon of medicines and the bluish smoggy DYNNE. He made a thorough examination and promised to cure everyone of everything; and the Soundkeeper let him try. “He gave several bad-tasting spoonfuls of medicine to every adult and child, and it worked—but not really as expected. For he cured everybody of everything but noise. The Soundkeeper became furious. She chased him from the valley forever and then issued the following decree: ” ‘FROM THIS DAY FORWARD THE VALLEY OF SOUND SHALL BE SILENT. SINCE SOUND IS NO LONGER APPRECIATED, I HEREBY ABOLISH IT. PLEASE RETURN ALL UNUSED AMOUNTS TO THE FORTRESS IMMEDIATELY.’ “And that’s the way it has been ever since,” he concluded sadly. “There is nothing we can do to change it, and each day new hardships are reported.” A small man, with his arms full of letters and messages, pushed through the crowd and offered them to Milo. Milo took one which read: Dear Soundkeeper, We had a thunderstorm last week and the thunder still hasn’t arrived. How long should we wait? Yours truly, A friend. Then he took a telegram which stated: BAND CONCERT GREAT SUCCESS STOP WHEN MAY WE EXPECT THE MUSIC STOP “Now you see,” continued the writer, “why you must help us attack the fortress and free sound.” “What can I do?” wrote Milo. “You must visit the Soundkeeper and bring from the fortress one sound, no matter how small, with which to load our cannon. For, if we can reach the walls with the slightest noise, they will collapse and free the rest. It won’t be easy, for she is hard to deceive, but you must try.” Milo thought for just a moment and then, with a resolute “I shall,” volunteered to go. Within a few minutes he stood bravely at the fortress door. “Knock, knock,” he wrote neatly on a piece of paper, which he pushed under the crack. In a moment the great portal swung open, and, as it closed behind him, a gentle voice sang out: “Right this way; I’m in the parlor.” “Can I talk now?” cried Milo happily, hearing his voice once again. “Yes, but only in here,” she replied softly. “Now do come into the parlor.” Milo walked slowly down the long hallway and into the little room where the Soundkeeper sat listening intently to an enormous radio set, whose switches, dials, knobs, meters, and speaker covered one whole wall, and which at the moment was playing nothing. “Isn’t that lovely?” she sighed. \\"It’s my favorite program—fifteen minutes of silence—and after that there’s a half hour of quiet and then an interlude of lull. Why, did you know that there are almost as many kinds of stillness as there are sounds? But, sadly enough, no one pays any attention to them these days. “Have you ever heard the wonderful silence just before the dawn?” she inquired. “Or the quiet and calm just as a storm ends? Or perhaps you know the silence when you haven’t the answer to a question you’ve been asked, or the hush of a country road at night, or the expectant pause in a roomful of people when someone is just about to speak, or, most beautiful of all, the moment after the door closes and you’re all alone in the whole house? Each one is different, you know, and all very beautiful, if you listen carefully.” As she spoke, the thousands of little bells and chimes which covered her from head to toe tinkled softly and, as if in reply, the telephone began to ring, too. “For someone who loves silence, she certainly talks a great deal,” thought Milo. “At one time I was able to listen to any sound made any place at any time,” the Soundkeeper remarked, pointing towards the radio wall, “but now I merely—” “Pardon me,” interrupted Milo as the phone continued to ring, “but aren’t you going to answer it?” “Oh no, not in the middle of the program,” she replied, and turned the silence up a little louder. “But it may be important,” insisted Milo. “Not at all,” she assured him; “it’s only me. It gets so lonely around here, with no sounds to distribute or collect, that I call myself seven or eight times a day just to see how I am.” “How are you?” he asked politely. “Not very well, I’m afraid. I seem to have a touch of static,” she complained. “But what brings you here? Of course—you’ve come to tour the vaults. Well, they’re usually open to the public only on Mondays from two to four, but since you’ve traveled so far, we’ll have to make an exception. Follow me, please.” She quickly bounced to her feet with a chorus of jingles and chimes and started down the hallway. “Don’t you just love jingles and chimes? I do,” she answered quickly. “Besides, they’re very convenient, for I’m always getting lost in this big fortress, and all I have to do is listen for them and then I know exactly where I am.” They entered a tiny cagelike elevator and traveled down for fully three quarters of a minute, stopping finally in an immense vault, whose long lines of file drawers and storage bins stretched in all directions from where here began to where there ended, and from floor to ceiling. “Every sound that’s ever been made in history is kept here,” said the Soundkeeper, skipping down one of the corridors with Milo in hand. “For instance, look here.” She opened one of the drawers and pulled out a small brown envelope. “This is the exact tune George Washington whistled when he crossed the Delaware on that icy night in 1777.” Milo peered into the envelope and, sure enough, that’s exactly what was in it. “But why do you collect them all?” he asked as she closed the drawer. “If we didn’t collect them,” said the Soundkeeper as they continued to stroll through the vault, “the air would be full of old sounds and noises bouncing around and bumping into things. It would be terribly confusing, because you’d never know whether you were listening to an old one or a new one. Besides, I do like to collect things, and there are more sounds than almost anything else. Why, I have everything here from the buzz of a mosquito a million years ago to what your mother said to you this morning, and if you come back here in two days, I’ll tell you what she said tomorrow. It’s really very simple; let me show you. Say a word—any word.” “Hello,” said Milo, for that was all he could think of. “Now where do you think it went?” she asked with a smile. “I don’t know,” said Milo, shrugging his shoulders. “I always thought that—” “Most people do,” she hummed, peering down one of the corridors. “Now, let me see: first we find the cabinet with today’s sounds. Ah, here it is. Then we look under G for greetings, then under M for Milo, and here it is already in its envelope. So, you see, the whole system is quite automatic. It’s a shame we hardly use it any more.” “That’s wonderful,” gasped Milo. “May I have one little sound as a souvenir?” “Certainly,” she said with pride, and then, immediately thinking better of it, added, “not. And don’t try to take one, because it’s strictly against the rules.” Milo was crestfallen. He had no idea how to steal a sound, even the smallest one, for the Soundkeeper always had at least one eye carefully focused on him. “Now for a look at the workshops,” she cried, whisking him through another door and into a large abandoned laboratory full of old pieces of equipment, all untended and rusting. “This is where we used to invent the sounds,” she said wistfully. “Do they have to be invented?” asked Milo, who seemed surprised at almost everything she told him. “I thought they just were.” “No one realizes how much trouble we go through to make them,” she complained. “Why, at one time this shop was crowded and busy from morning to night.” “But how do you invent a sound?” Milo inquired. “Oh, that’s very easy,” she said. “First you must decide exactly what the sound looks like, for each sound has its own exact shape and size. Then you make some of them here in the shop, and grind each one three times into an invisible powder, and throw a little of each into the air every time you need it.” “But I’ve never seen a sound,” Milo insisted. “You never see them out there,” she said, waving her arm in the general direction of everywhere, “except every once in a while on a very cold morning when they freeze. But in here we see them all the time. Here, let me show you.” She picked up a padded stick and struck a nearby bass drum six times. Six large woolly, fluffy cotton balls, each about two feet across, rolled silently out onto the floor. “You see,” she said, putting some of them into a large grinder. “Now listen.” And she took a pinch of the invisible powder and threw it into the air with a “BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.” “Do you know what a handclap looks like?” Milo shook his head. “Try it,” she commanded. He clapped his hands once and a single sheet of clean white paper fluttered to the floor. He tried it three more times and three more sheets of paper did the very same thing. And then he applauded as fast as he could and a great cascade of papers filled the air. “Isn’t that simple? And it’s the same for all sounds. If you think about it, you’ll soon know what each one looks like. Take laughter, for instance,” she said, laughing brightly, and a thousand tiny brightly colored bubbles flew into the air and popped noiselessly. “Or speech,” she continued. “Some of it is light and airy, some sharp and pointed, but most of it, I’m afraid, is just heavy and dull.” “How about music?” asked Milo excitedly. “Right over here—we weave it on our looms. Symphonies are the large beautiful carpets with all the rhythms and melodies woven in. Concertos are these tapestries, and all the other bolts of cloth are serenades, waltzes, overtures, and rhapsodies. And we also have some of the songs that you often sing,” she cried, holding up a handful of brightly colored handkerchiefs. She stopped for a moment and said sadly, “We even had one section over there that did nothing but put the sound of the ocean into sea shells. This was once such a happy place.” “Then why don’t you make sound for everyone now?” he shouted, so eagerly that the Soundkeeper leaped back in surprise. “Don’t shout so, young man! If there’s one thing we need more of around here, it’s less noise. Now come with me and I’ll tell you all about it—and put that down immediately!” Her last remark was directed toward Milo’s efforts to stuff one of the large drumbeats into his back pocket. They returned quickly to the parlor, and when the Soundkeeper had settled herself in a chair and carefully tuned the radio to a special hour of hush, Milo asked his question once again, in a somewhat lower voice. “It doesn’t make me happy to hold back the sounds,” she began softly, “for if we listen to them carefully they can sometimes tell us things far better than words.” “But if that is so,” asked Milo—and he had no doubt that it was—“shouldn’t you release them?” “NEVER!” she cried. “They just use them to make horrible noises which are ugly to see and worse to hear. I leave all that to Dr. Dischord and that awful, awful DYNNE.” “But some noises are good sounds, aren’t they?” he insisted. “That may be true,” she replied stubbornly, “but if they won’t make the sounds that I like, they won’t make any.” “But—” he started to say, and it got no further than that. For while he was about to say that he didn’t think that that was quite fair (a thought to which the obstinate Soundkeeper might not have taken kindly) he suddenly discovered the way he would carry his little sound from the fortress. In the instant between saying the word and before it sailed off into the air he had clamped his lips shut—and the “but” was trapped in his mouth, all made but not spoken. “Well, I mustn’t keep you all day,” she said impatiently. “Now turn your pockets out so that I can see that you didn’t steal anything and you can be on your way.” When he had satisfied the Soundkeeper, he nodded his farewell—for it would have been most impractical to say “Thank you” or “Good afternoon”—and raced out the door. 13. Unfortunate Conclusions With his mouth shut tight, and his feet moving as fast as thoughts could make them, Milo ran all the way back to the car. There was great excitement when he arrived, as Tock raced happily down the road to greet him. The Humbug personally accepted all congratulations from the crowd. “Where is the sound?” someone hastily scribbled on the blackboard, and they all waited anxiously for the reply. Milo caught his breath, picked up the chalk, and explained simply, “It’s on the tip of my tongue.” Several people excitedly threw their hats into the air, some shouted what would have been a loud hurrah, and the rest pushed the heavy cannon into place. They aimed it directly at the thickest part of the fortress wall and packed it full of gunpowder. Milo stood on tiptoe, leaned over into the cannon’s mouth, and parted his lips. The small sound dropped silently to the bottom and everything was ready. In another moment the fuse was lit and sputtering. “I hope no one gets hurt,” thought Milo, and, before he had time to think again, an immense cloud of gray and white smoke leaped from the gun and, along with it, so softly that it was hardly heard, came the sound of— BUT It flew toward the wall for several seconds in a high, lazy arc and then struck ever so lightly just to the right of the big door. For an instant there was an ominous stillness, quieter and more silent than ever before, as if even the air was holding its breath. And then, almost immediately, there was a blasting, roaring, thundering smash, followed by a crushing, shattering, bursting crash, as every stone in the fortress came toppling to the ground and the vaults burst open, spilling the sounds of history into the wind. Every sound that had ever been uttered or made, from way back to when there were none, to way up when there were too many, came hurtling out of the debris in a way that sounded as though everyone in the world was laughing, whistling, shouting, crying, singing, whispering, humming, screaming, coughing, and sneezing, all at the same time. There were bits of old speeches floating about, as well as recited lessons, gunshots from old wars, babies’ cries, auto horns, waterfalls, electric fans, galloping horses, and a great deal of everything else. For a while there was total and deafening confusion and then, almost as quickly as they’d come, all the old sounds disappeared over the hill in search of their new freedom, and things were normal again. The people quickly went about their busy talkative business and, as the smoke and dust cleared, only Milo, Tock, and the Humbug noticed the Soundkeeper sitting disconsolately on a pile of rubble. “I’m terribly sorry,” said Milo sympathetically as the three of them went to console her. “But we had to do it,” added Tock, sniffing around the ruins. “What a terrible mess,” observed the Humbug, with his knack for saying exactly the wrong thing. The Soundkeeper looked around with an expression of unrelieved sadness on her unhappy face, “It will take years to collect all those sounds again,” she sobbed, “and even longer to put them back in proper order. But it’s all my fault. For you can’t improve sound by having only silence. The problem is to use each at the proper time.” As she spoke, the familiar and unmistakable squinch-squanch, squinchsquanch of the DYNNE’s heavy toot-steps could be heard plodding over the hill, and when he finally appeared he was dragging an incredibly large sack behind him. “Can anyone use these sounds?” he puffed, mopping his forehead. “They all came over the hill at once and none of them are awful enough for me.” The Soundkeeper peered into the sack, and there were all the sounds which had burst from the vaults. “How nice of you to return them!” she cried happily. “You and the doctor must come by for an evening of beautiful music when my fortress is repaired.” The thought of it so horrified the DYNNE that he excused himself immediately and dashed off down the road in a great panic. “I hope I haven’t offended him,” she said with some concern. “He only likes unpleasant sounds,” volunteered Tock. “Ah yes,” she sighed; “I keep forgetting that many people do. But I suppose they are necessary, for you’d never really know how pleasant one was unless you knew how unpleasant it wasn’t.” She paused for a moment, then continued: “If only Rhyme and Reason were here, I’m sure things would improve.” “That’s why we’re going to rescue them,” said Milo proudly. “What a long, hard journey that will be! You’ll need some nourishment,” she cried, handing Milo a small brown package, neatly wrapped and tied with string. “Now remember: they’re not for eating, but for listening, because you’ll often be hungry for sounds as well as food. Here are street noises at night, train whistles a long way off, dry leaves burning, busy department stores, crunching toast, creaking bedsprings, and, of course, all kinds of laughter. There’s a little of each, and in faroff lonely places I think you’ll be glad to have them.” “I’m sure we will,” replied Milo gratefully. “Just take this road to the sea and turn left,” she told them. “You’ll soon be in Digitopolis.” Arid almost before she had finished, they had said good-by and left the valley behind them. The shore line was peaceful and flat, and the calm sea bumped it playfully along the sandy beach. In the distance a beautiful island covered with palm trees and flowers beckoned invitingly from the sparkling water. “Nothing can possibly go wrong now,” cried the Humbug happily, and as soon as he’d said it he leaped from the car, as if stuck by a pin, and sailed all the way to the little island. “And we’ll have plenty of time,” answered Tock, who hadn’t noticed that the bug was missing—and he, too, suddenly leaped into the air and disappeared. “It certainly couldn’t be a nicer day,” agreed Milo, who was too busy looking at the road to see that the others had gone. And in a split second he was gone also. He landed next to Tock and the terrified Humbug on the tiny island, which now looked completely different. Instead of palms and flowers, there were only rocks and the twisted stumps of long-dead trees. It certainly didn’t seem like the same place they had seen from the road. “Pardon me,” said Milo to the first man who happened by; “can you tell me where I am?” “Pardon me,” replied the man; “can you tell me who I am?” The man was dressed in a shaggy tweed jacket and knickers with long woolen stockings and a cap that had a peak both front and back, and he seemed as confused as he could be. “You must know who you are,” said Milo impatiently. “You must know where you are,” he replied with equal annoyance. “Oh dear, this is going to be difficult,” Milo whispered to Tock. “I wonder if we can help him.” They conferred for a few minutes and finally the bug looked up and said, “Can you describe yourself?” “Yes, indeed,” the man replied happily. “I’m as tall as can be”—and he grew straight up until all that could be seen of him were his shoes and stockings—“and I’m as short as can be”—and he shrank down to the size of a pebble. “I’m as generous as can be,” he said, handing each of them a large red apple, “and I’m as selfish as can be,” he snarled, grabbing them back again. “I’m as strong as can be,” he roared, lifting an enormous boulder over his head, “and I’m as weak as can be,” he gasped, staggering under the weight of his hat. “I’m as smart as can be,” he remarked in twelve different languages, “and I’m as stupid as can be,” he admitted, putting both feet in one shoe. “I’m as graceful as can be,” he hummed, balancing on one toe, “and I’m as clumsy as can be,” he cried, sticking his thumb in his eye. “I’m as fast as can be,” he announced, running around the island twice in no time at all, “and I’m as slow as can be,” he complained, waving good-by to a snail. “Is that any help to you?” Once again they conferred in busy whispers until all three agreed. “It’s really very simple,” said the Humbug, twirling his cane. “If everything you say is true,” added Tock. “Then, without a doubt,” Milo concluded brightly, “you must be Canby.” “Of course, yes, of course,” the man shouted. “Why didn’t I think of that? I’m as happy as can be.” Then he quickly sat down, put his head in his hands, and sighed. “But I’m also as sad as can be.” “Now will you tell me where we are?” asked Tock as he looked around the desolate island. “To be sure,” said Canby; “you’re on the Island of Conclusions. Make yourself at home. You’re apt to be here for some time.” “But how did we get here?” asked Milo, who was still a bit puzzled by being there at all. “You jumped, of course,” explained Canby. “That’s the way most everyone gets here. It’s really quite simple: every time you decide something without having a good reason, you jump to Conclusions whether you like it or not. It’s such an easy trip to make that I’ve been here hundreds of times.” “But this is such an unpleasant-looking place,” Milo remarked. “Yes, that’s true,” admitted Canby; “it does look much better from a distance.” As he spoke, at least eight or nine more people sailed onto the island from every direction possible. “Well, I’m going to jump right back,” announced the Humbug, who took two or three practice bends, leaped as far as he could, and landed in a heap two feet away. “That won’t do at all,” scolded Canby, helping him to his feet. “You can never jump away from Conclusions. Getting back is not so easy. That’s why we’re so terribly crowded here.” That was certainly the truth, for all along the bleak shore and clustered on the rocks for as far as anyone could see were enormous crowds of people, all sadly looking out to sea. “Isn’t there even a boat?” asked Milo, anxious to get on with his trip. “Oh no,” replied Canby, shaking his head. “The only way back is to swim, and that’s a very long and a very hard way.” “I don’t like to get wet,” moaned the unhappy bug, and he shuddered at the thought. “Neither do they,” said Canby sadly. “That’s what keeps them here. But I wouldn’t worry too much about it, for you can swim all day in the Sea of Knowledge and still come out completely dry. Most people do. But you must excuse me now. I have to greet the new arrivals. As you know, I’m as friendly as can be.” Over the Humbug’s strenuous objections, Milo and Tock decided to swim, and, protesting loudly, the bug was dragged along with them toward the sea. Canby hurried off to answer more questions, and the last thing he was heard to say was “Pardon me, can you tell me who I am?” They swam and swam and swam for what seemed like hours, and only Tock’s firm encouragement kept Milo struggling through the icy water. At last they reached the shore, thoroughly exhausted and, except for the bug, completely soaked. “That wasn’t bad at all,” the Humbug said, straightening his tie and brushing himself off. “I must visit there again.” “I’m sure you will,” gasped Milo. “But from now on I’m going to have a very good reason before I make up my mind about anything. You can lose too much time jumping to Conclusions.” The car was just where they’d left it, and in a moment they were on their way again as the road turned away from the sea and began its long climb into the mountains. The warm sun and billowy breezes dried them as they went. “I hope we reach Digitopolis soon,” said Milo, thinking of the breakfast they hadn’t eaten. “I wonder how far it is.” 14. The Dodecahedron Leads the Way Up ahead, the road divided into three and, as if in reply to Milo’s question, an enormous road sign, pointing in all three directions, stated clearly: DIGITOPOLIS 5 Miles 1,600 Rods 8,800 Yards 26,400 Feet 316,800 Inches 633,600 Half inches AND THEN SOME “Let’s travel by miles,” advised the Humbug; “it’s shorter.” “Let’s travel by half inches,” suggested Milo; “it’s quicker.” “But which road should we take?” asked Tock. “It must make a difference.” As they argued, a most peculiar little figure stepped nimbly from behind the sign and approached them, talking all the while. “Yes, indeed; indeed it does; certainly; my, yes; it does make a difference; undoubtedly.” He was constructed (for that’s really the only way to describe him) of a large assortment of lines and angles connected together into one solid many-sided shape—somewhat like a cube that’s had all its corners cut off and then had all its corners cut off again. Each of the edges was neatly labeled with a small letter, and each of the angles with a large one. He wore a handsome beret on top, and peering intently from one of his several surfaces was a very serious face. Perhaps if you look at the picture you’ll know what I mean. When he reached the car, the figure doffed his cap and recited in a loud clear voice: “My angles are many. My sides are not few. I’m the Dodecahedron. Who are you?” “What’s a Dodecahedron?” inquired Milo, who was barely able to pronounce the strange word. “See for yourself,” he said, turning around slowly. “A Dodecahedron is a mathematical shape with twelve faces.” Just as he said it, eleven other faces appeared, one on each surface, and each one wore a different expression. “I usually use one at a time,” he confided, as all but the smiling one disappeared again. “It saves wear and tear. What are you called?” “Milo,” said Milo. “That is an odd name,” he said, changing his smiling face for a frowning one. “And you only have one face.” “Is that bad?” asked Milo, making sure it was still there. “You’ll soon wear it out using it for everything,” replied the Dodecahedron. “Now I have one for smiling, one for laughing, one for crying, one for frowning, one for thinking, one for pouting, and six more besides. Is everyone with one face called a Milo?” “Oh no,” Milo replied; “some are called Henry or George or Robert or John or lots of other things.” “How terribly confusing,” he cried. “Everything here is called exactly what it is. The triangles are called triangles, the circles are called circles, and even the same numbers have the same name. Why, can you imagine what would happen if we named all the twos Henry or George or Robert or John or lots of other things? You’d have to say Robert plus John equals four, and if the four’s name were Albert, things would be hopeless.” “I never thought of it that way,” Milo admitted. “Then I suggest you begin at once,” admonished the Dodecahedron from his admonishing face, “for here in Digitopolis everything is quite precise.” “Then perhaps you can help us decide which road to take,” said Milo. “By all means,” he replied happily. “There’s nothing to it. If a small car carrying three people at thirty miles an hour for ten minutes along a road five miles long at 11:35 in the morning starts at the same time as three people who have been traveling in a little automobile at twenty miles an hour for fifteen minutes on another road exactly twice as long as one half the distance of the other, while a dog, a bug, and a boy travel an equal distance in the same time or the same distance in an equal time along a third road in mid-October, then which one arrives first and which is the best way to go?” “Seventeen!” shouted the Humbug, scribbling furiously on a piece of paper. “Well, I’m not sure, but—” Milo stammered after several minutes of frantic figuring. “You’ll have to do better than that,” scolded the Dodecahedron, “or you’ll never know how far you’ve gone or whether or not you’ve ever gotten there.” “I’m not very good at problems,” admitted Milo. “What a shame,” sighed the Dodecahedron. “They’re so very useful. Why, did you know that if a beaver two feet long with a tail a foot and a half long can build a dam twelve feet high and six feet wide in two days, all you would need to build Boulder Dam is a beaver sixty-eight feet long with a fifty-one-foot tail?” “Where would you find a beaver that big?” grumbled the Humbug as his pencil point snapped. “I’m sure I don’t know,” he replied, “but if you did, you’d certainly know what to do with him.” “That’s absurd,” objected Milo, whose head was spinning from all the numbers and questions. “That may be true,” he acknowledged, “but it’s completely accurate, and as long as the answer is right, who cares if the question is wrong? If you want sense, you’ll have to make it yourself.” “All three roads arrive at the same place at the same time,” interrupted Tock, who had patiently been doing the first problem. “Correct!” shouted the Dodecahedron. “And I’ll take you there myself. Now you can see how important problems are. If you hadn’t done this one properly, you might have gone the wrong way.” “I can’t see where I made my mistake,” said the Humbug, frantically rechecking his figures. “But if all the roads arrive at the same place at the same time, then aren’t they all the right way?” asked Milo. “Certainly not!” he shouted, glaring from his most upset face. “They’re all the wrong way. Just because you have a choice, it doesn’t mean that any of them has to be right.” He walked to the sign and quickly spun it around three times. As he did, the three roads vanished and a new one suddenly appeared, heading in the direction that the sign now pointed. “Is every road five miles from Digitopolis?” asked Milo. “I’m afraid it has to be,” the Dodecahedron replied, leaping onto the back of the car. “It’s the only sign we’ve got.” The new road was quite bumpy and full of stones, and each time they hit one, the Dodecahedron bounced into the air and landed on one of his faces, with a sulk or a smile or a laugh or a frown, depending upon which one it was. “We’ll soon be there,” he announced happily, after one of his short flights. “Welcome to the land of numbers.” “It doesn’t look very inviting,” the bug remarked, for, as they climbed higher and higher, not a tree or a blade of grass could be seen anywhere. Only the rocks remained. “Is this the place where numbers are made?” asked Milo as the car lurched again, and this time the Dodecahedron sailed off down the mountainside, head over heels and grunt over grimace, until he landed sad side up at what looked like the entrance to a cave. “They’re not made,” he replied, as if nothing had happened. “You have to dig for them. Don’t you know anything at all about numbers?” “Well, I don’t think they’re very important,” snapped Milo, too embarrassed to admit the truth. “NOT IMPORTANT!” roared the Dodecahedron, turning red with fury. “Could you have tea for two without the two—or three blind mice without the three? Would there be four corners of the earth if there weren’t a four? And how would you sail the seven seas without a seven?” “All I meant was—” began Milo, but the Dodecahedron, overcome with emotion and shouting furiously, carried right on. “If you had high hopes, how would you know how high they were? And did you know that narrow escapes come in all different widths? Would you travel the whole wide world without ever knowing how wide it was? And how could you do anything at long last,” he concluded, waving his arms over his head, “without knowing how long the last was? Why, numbers are the most beautiful and valuable things in the world. Just follow me and I’ll show you.” He turned on his heel and stalked off into the cave. “Come along, come along,” he shouted from the dark hole. “I can’t wait for you all day.” And in a moment they’d followed him into the mountain. It took several minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dim light, and during that time strange scratching, scraping, tapping, scuffling noises could be heard all around them. “Put these on,” instructed the Dodecahedron, handing each of them a helmet with a flashlight attached to the top. “Where are we going?” whispered Milo, for it seemed like the kind of place in which you whispered. “We’re here,” he replied with a sweeping gesture. “This is the numbers mine.” Milo squinted into the darkness and saw for the first time that they had entered a vast cavern lit only by a soft, eerie glow from the great stalactites which hung ominously from the ceiling. Passages and corridors honeycombed the walls and wound their way from floor to ceiling, up and down the sides of the cave. And, everywhere he looked, Milo saw little men no bigger than himself busy digging and chopping, shoveling and scraping, pulling and tugging carts full of stone from one place to another. “Right this way,” instructed the Dodecahedron, “and watch where you step.” As he spoke, his voice echoed and re-echoed and reechoed again, mixing its sound with the buzz of activity all around them. Tock trotted along next to Milo, and the Humbug, stepping daintily, followed behind. “Whose mine is it?” asked Milo, stepping around two of the loaded wagons. “BY THE FOUR MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY-NINE HAIRS ON MY HEAD, IT’S MINE, OF COURSE!” bellowed a voice from across the cavern. And striding toward them came a figure who could only have been the Mathemagician. He was dressed in a long flowing robe covered entirely with complex mathematical equations and a tall pointed cap that made him look very wise. In his left hand he carried a long staff with a pencil point at one end and a large rubber eraser at the other. “It’s a lovely mine,” apologized the Humbug, who was always intimidated by loud noises. “The biggest number mine in the kingdom,” said the Mathemagician proudly. “Are there any precious stones in it?” asked Milo excitedly. “PRECIOUS STONES!” he roared, even louder than before. And then he leaned over toward Milo and whispered softly, “By the eight million two hundred and forty-seven thousand three hundred and twelve threads in my robe, I’ll say there are. Look here.” He reached into one of the carts and pulled out a small object, which he polished vigorously on his robe. When he held it up to the light, it sparkled brightly. “But that’s a five,” objected Milo, for that was certainly what it was. “Exactly,” agreed the Mathemagician; “as valuable a jewel as you’ll find anywhere. Look at some of the others.” He scooped up a great handful of stones and poured them into Milo’s arms. They included all the numbers from one to nine, and even an assortment of zeros. “We dig them and polish them right here,” volunteered the Dodecahedron, pointing to a group of workers busily employed at the buffing wheels; “and then we send them all over the world. Marvelous, aren’t they?” “They are exceptional,” said Tock, who had a special fondness for numbers. “So that’s where they come from,” said Milo, looking in awe at the glittering collection of numbers. He returned them to the Dodecahedron as carefully as possible but, as he did, one dropped to the floor with a smash and broke in two. The Humbug winced and Milo looked terribly concerned. “Oh, don’t worry about that,” said the Mathemagician as he scooped up the pieces. “We use the broken ones for fractions.” “Haven’t you any diamonds or emeralds or rubies?” asked the bug irritably, for he was quite disappointed in what he’d seen so far. “Yes, indeed,” the Mathemagician replied, leading them to the rear of the cave; “right this way.” There, piled into enormous mounds that reached almost to the ceiling, were not only diamonds and emeralds and rubies but also sapphires, amethysts, topazes, moonstones, and garnets. It was the most amazing mass of wealth that any of them had ever seen. “They’re such a terrible nuisance,” sighed the Mathemagician, “and no one can think of what to do with them. So we just keep digging them up and throwing them out. Now,” he said, taking a silver whistle from his pocket and blowing it loudly, “let’s have some lunch.” And for the first time in his life the astonished bug couldn’t think of a thing to say. 15. This Way to Infinity Into the cavern rushed eight of the strongest miners carrying an immense caldron which bubbled and sizzled and sent great clouds of savory steam spiraling slowly to the ceiling. A sweet yet pungent aroma hung in the air and drifted easily from one anxious nose to the other, stopping only long enough to make several mouths water and a few stomachs growl. Milo, Tock, and the Humbug watched eagerly as the rest of the workers put down their tools and gathered around the big pot to help themselves. “Perhaps you’d care for something to eat?” said the Mathemagician, offering each of them a heaping bowlful. “Yes, sir,” said Milo, who was beside himself with hunger. “Thank you,” added Tock. The Humbug made no reply, for he was already too busy eating, and in a moment the three of them had finished absolutely everything they’d been given. “Please have another portion,” said the Mathemagician, filling their bowls once more; and as quickly as they’d finished the first one the second was emptied too “Don’t stop now,” he insisted, serving them again, and again, and again, and again, and again. “How very strange,” thought Milo as he finished his seventh helping. \\"Each one I eat makes me a little hungrier than the one before. “Do have some more,” suggested the Mathemagician, and they continued to eat just as fast as he filled the plates. After Milo had eaten nine portions, Tock eleven, and the Humbug, without once stopping to look up, twenty-three, the Mathemagician blew his whistle for a second time and immediately the pot was removed and the miners returned to work. “U-g-g-g-h-h-h,” gasped the bug, suddenly realizing that he was twenty-three times hungrier than when he started, “I think I’m starving.” “Me, too,” complained Milo, whose stomach felt as empty as he could ever remember; “and I ate so much.” “Yes, it was delicious, wasn’t it?” agreed the pleased Dodecahedron, wiping the gravy from several of his mouths. “It’s the specialty of the kingdom—subtraction stew.” “I have more of an appetite than when I began,” said Tock, leaning weakly against one of the larger rocks. “Certainly,” replied the Mathemagician; “what did you expect? The more you eat, the hungrier you get. Everyone knows that.” “They do?” said Milo doubtfully. “Then how do you ever get enough?” “Enough?” he said impatiently. “Here in Digitopolis we have our meals when we’re full and eat until we’re hungry. That way, when you don’t have anything at all, you have more than enough. It’s a very economical system. You must have been quite stuffed to have eaten so much.” “It’s completely logical,” explained the Dodecahedron. “The more you want, the less you get, and the less you get, the more you have. Simple arithmetic, that’s all. Suppose you had something and added something to it. What would that make?” “More,” said Milo quickly. “Quite correct,” he nodded. “Now suppose you had something and added nothing to it. What would you have?” “The same,” he answered again, without much conviction. “Splendid,” cried the Dodecahedron. “And suppose you had something and added less than nothing to it. What would you have then?” “FAMINE!” roared the anguished Humbug, who suddenly realized that that was exactly what he’d eaten twenty-three bowls of. “It’s not as bad as all that,” said the Dodecahedron from his most sympathetic face. “In a few hours you’ll be nice and full again—just in time for dinner.” “Oh dear,” said Milo sadly and softly. “I only eat when I’m hungry.” “What a curious idea,” said the Mathemagician, raising his staff over his head and scrubbing the rubber end back and forth several times on the ceiling. “The next thing you’ll have us believe is that you only sleep when you’re tired.” And by the time he’d finished the sentence, the cavern, the miners, and the Dodecahedron had vanished, leaving just the four of them standing in the Mathemagician’s workshop. “I often find,” he casually explained to his dazed visitors, “that the best way to get from one place to another is to erase everything and begin again. Please make yourself at home.” “Do you always travel that way?” asked Milo as he glanced curiously at the strange circular room, whose sixteen tiny arched windows corresponded exactly to the sixteen points of the compass. Around the entire circumference were numbers from zero to three hundred and sixty, marking the degrees of the circle, and on the floor, walls, tables, chairs, desks, cabinets, and ceiling were labels showing their heights, widths, depths, and distances to and from each other. To one side was a gigantic note pad set on an artist’s easel, and from hooks and strings hung a collection of scales, rulers, measures, weights, tapes, and all sorts of other devices for measuring any number of things in every possible way. “No indeed,” replied the Mathemagician, and this time he raised the sharpened end of his staff, drew a thin straight line in the air, and then walked gracefully across it from one side of the room to the other. “Most of the time I take the shortest distance between any two points. And, of course, when I should be in several places at once,” he remarked, writing 7 × 1 = 7 carefully on the note pad, “I simply multiply.” Suddenly there were seven Mathemagicians standing side by side, and each one looked exactly like the other. “How did you do that?” gasped Milo. “There’s nothing to it,” they all said in chorus, “if you have a magic staff.” Then six of them canceled themselves out and simply disappeared. “But it’s only a big pencil,” the Humbug objected, tapping at it with his cane. “True enough,” agreed the Mathemagician; “but once you learn to use it, there’s no end to what you can do.” “Can you make things disappear?” asked Milo excitedly. “Why, certainly,” he said, striding over to the easel. “Just step a little closer and watch carefully.” After demonstrating that there was nothing up his sleeves, in his hat, or behind his back, he wrote quickly: 4 + 9 − 2 × 16 + 1 ÷ 3 × 6 − 67 + 8 × 2 − 3 + 26 − 1 ÷ 34 + 3 ÷ 7 + 2 − 5 = Then he looked up expectantly. “Seventeen!” shouted the bug, who always managed to be first with the wrong answer. “It all comes to zero,” corrected Milo. “Precisely,” said the Mathemagician, making a very theatrical bow, and the entire line of numbers vanished before their eyes. “Now is there anything else you’d like to see?” “Yes, please,” said Milo. “Can you show me the biggest number there is?” “I’d be delighted,” he replied, opening one of the closet doors. “We keep it right here. It took four miners just to dig it out.” Inside was the biggest Milo had ever seen. It was fully twice as high as the Mathemagician. “No, that’s not what I mean,” objected Milo. “Can you show me the longest number there is?” “Surely,” said the Mathemagician, opening another door. “Here it is. It took three carts to carry it here.” Inside this closet was the longest imaginable. It was just about as wide as the three was high. “No, no, no, that’s not what I mean either,” he said, looking helplessly at Tock. “I think what you would like to see,” said the dog, scratching himself just under half-past four, “is the number of greatest possible magnitude.” “Well, why didn’t you say so?” said the Mathemagician, who was busily measuring the edge of a raindrop. “What’s the greatest number you can think of?” “Nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine,” recited Milo breathlessly. “Very good,” said the Mathemagician. “Now add one to it. Now add one again,” he repeated when Milo had added the previous one. “Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add one again. Now add—” “But when can I stop?” pleaded Milo. “Never,” said the Mathemagician with a little smile, “for the number you want is always at least one more than the number you’ve got, and it’s so large that if you started saying it yesterday you wouldn’t finish tomorrow.” “Where could you ever find a number so big?” scoffed the Humbug. “In the same place they have the smallest number there is,” he answered helpfully; “and you know what that is.” “Certainly,” said the bug, suddenly remembering something to do at the other end of the room. “One one-millionth?” asked Milo, trying to think of the smallest fraction possible. “Almost,” said the Mathemagician. “Now divide it in half. Now divide it in half again. Now divide it in half again. Now divide it in half again. Now divide it in half again. Now divide it in half again. Now divide—” “Oh dear,” shouted Milo, holding his hands to his ears, “doesn’t that ever stop either?” “How can it,” said the Mathemagician, “when you can always take half of whatever you have left until it’s so small that if you started to say it right now you’d finish even before you began?” “Where could you keep anything so tiny?” Milo asked, trying very hard to imagine such a thing. The Mathemagician stopped what he was doing and explained simply, “Why, in a box that’s so small you can’t see it—and that’s kept in a drawer that’s so small you can’t see it, in a dresser that’s so small you can’t see it, in a house that’s so small you can’t see it, on a street that’s so small you can’t see it, in a city that’s so small you can’t see it, which is part of a country that’s so small you can’t see it, in a world that’s so small you can’t see it.” Then he sat down, fanned himself with a handkerchief, and continued. “Then, of course, we keep the whole thing in another box that’s so small you can’t see it— and, if you follow me, I’ll show you where to find it.” They walked to one of the small windows and there, tied to the sill, was one end of a line that stretched along the ground and into the distance until completely out of sight. “Just follow that line forever,” said the Mathemagician, “and when you reach the end, turn left. There you’ll find the land of Infinity, where the tallest, the shortest, the biggest, the smallest, and the most and the least of everything are kept.” “I really don’t have that much time,” said Milo anxiously. “Isn’t there a quicker way?” “Well, you might try this flight of stairs,” he suggested, opening another door and pointing up. “It goes there, too.” Milo bounded across the room and started up the stairs two at a time. “Wait for me, please,” he shouted to Tock and the Humbug. “I’ll be gone just a few minutes.” 16. A Very Dirty Bird Up he went—very quickly at first—then more slowly—then in a little while even more slowly than that—and finally, after many minutes of climbing up the endless stairway, one weary foot was barely able to follow the other. Milo suddenly realized that with all his effort he was no closer to the top than when he began, and not a great deal further from the bottom. But he struggled on for a while longer, until at last, completely exhausted, he collapsed onto one of the steps. “I should have known it,” he mumbled, resting his tired legs and filling his lungs with air. “This is just like the line that goes on forever, and I’ll never get there.” “You wouldn’t like it much anyway,” someone replied gently. “Infinity is a dreadfully poor place. They can never manage to make ends meet.” Milo looked up, with his head still resting heavily in his hand; he was becoming quite accustomed to being addressed at the oddest times, in the oddest places, by the oddest people—and this time he was not at all disappointed. Standing next to him on the step was exactly one half of a small child who had been divided neatly from top to bottom. “Pardon me for staring,” said Milo, after he had been staring for some time, “but I’ve never seen half a child before.” “It’s .58 to be precise,” replied the child from the left side of his mouth (which happened to be the only side of his mouth). “I beg your pardon?” said Milo. “It’s .58,” he repeated; “it’s a little bit more than a half.” “Have you always been that way?” asked Milo impatiently, for he felt that that was a needlessly fine distinction. “My goodness, no,” the child assured him. “A few years ago I was just .42 and, believe me, that was terribly inconvenient.” “What is the rest of your family like?” said Milo, this time a bit more sympathetically. “Oh, we’re just the average family,” he said thoughtfully; “mother, father, and 2.58 children—and, as I explained, I’m the .58.” “It must be rather odd being only part of a person,” Milo remarked. “Not at all,” said the child. “Every average family has 2.58 children, so I always have someone to play with. Besides, each family also has an average of 1.3 automobiles, and since I’m the only one who can drive three tenths of a car, I get to use it all the time.” “But averages aren’t real,” objected Milo; “they’re just imaginary.” “That may be so,” he agreed, “but they’re also very useful at times. For instance, if you didn’t have any money at all, but you happened to be with four other people who had ten dollars apiece, then you’d each have an average of eight dollars. Isn’t that right?” “I guess so,” said Milo weakly. “Well, think how much better off you’d be, just because of averages,” he explained convincingly. “And think of the poor farmer when it doesn’t rain all year: if there wasn’t an average yearly rainfall of 37 inches in this part of the country, all his crops would wither and die.” It all sounded terribly confusing to Milo, for he had always had trouble in school with just this subject. “There are still other advantages,” continued the child. “For instance, if one rat were cornered by nine cats, then, on the average, each cat would be 10 per cent rat and the rat would be 90 per cent cat. If you happened to be a rat, you can see how much nicer it would make things.” “But that can never be,” said Milo, jumping to his feet. “Don’t be too sure,” said the child patiently, “for one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, is that many of the things which can never be, often are. You see,” he went on, “it’s very much like your trying to reach Infinity. You know that it’s there, but you just don’t know where— but just because you can never reach it doesn’t mean that it’s not worth looking for.” “I hadn’t thought of it that way,” said Milo, starting down the stairs. “I think I’ll go back now.” “A wise decision,” the child agreed; “but try again someday—perhaps you’ll get much closer.” And, as Milo waved good-by, he smiled warmly, which he usually did on the average of 47 times a day. “Everyone here knows so much more than I do,” thought Milo, as he leaped from step to step. “I’ll have to do a lot better if I’m going to rescue the princesses.” In a few moments he’d reached the bottom again and burst into the workshop, where Tock and the Humbug were eagerly watching the Mathemagician perform. “Ah, back already,” he cried, greeting him with a friendly wave. “I hope you found what you were looking for.” “I’m afraid not,” admitted Milo. And then he added in a very discouraged tone, “Everything in Digitopolis is much too difficult for me.” The Mathemagician nodded knowingly and stroked his chin several times. “You’ll find,” he remarked gently, “that the only thing you can do easily is be wrong, and that’s hardly worth the effort.” Milo tried very hard to understand all the things he’d been told, and all the things he’d seen, and, as he spoke, one curious thing still bothered him. “Why is it,” he said quietly, “that quite often even the things which are correct just don’t seem to be right?” A look of deep melancholy crossed the Mathemagician’s face and his eyes grew moist with sadness. Everything was silent, and it was several minutes before he was able to reply at all. “How very true,” he sobbed, supporting himself on the staff. “It has been that way since Rhyme and Reason were banished.” “Quite so,” began the Humbug. “I personally feel that—” “AND ALL BECAUSE OF THAT STUBBORN WRETCH AZAZ,” roared the Mathemagician, completely overwhelming the bug, for now his sadness had changed to fury and he stalked about the room adding up anger and multiplying wrath. “IT’S ALL HIS FAULT.” “Perhaps if you discussed it with him—” Milo started to say, but never had time to finish. “He’s much too unreasonable,” interrupted the Mathemagician again. “Why, just last month I sent him a very friendly letter, which he never had the courtesy to answer. See for yourself.” He handed Milo a copy of the letter, which read: “But maybe he doesn’t understand numbers,” said Milo, who found it a little difficult to read himself. “NONSENSE!” he bellowed. “Everyone understands numbers. No matter what language you speak, they always mean the same thing. A seven is a seven anywhere in the world.” “My goodness,” thought Milo, “everybody is so terribly sensitive about the things they know best.” “With your permission,” said Tock, changing the subject, “we’d like to rescue Rhyme and Reason.” “Has Azaz agreed to it?” the Mathemagician inquired. “Yes, sir,” the dog assured him. “THEN I DON’T,” he thundered again, “for since they’ve been banished, we’ve never agreed on anything—and we never will.” He emphasized his last remark with a dark and ominous look. “Never?” asked Milo, with the slightest touch of disbelief in his voice. “NEVER!” he repeated. “And if you can prove otherwise, you have my permission to go.” “Well,” said Milo, who had thought about this problem very carefully ever since leaving Dictionopolis. “Then with whatever Azaz agrees, you disagree.” “Correct,” said the Mathemagician with a tolerant smile. “And with whatever Azaz disagrees, you agree.” “Also correct,” yawned the Mathemagician, nonchalantly cleaning his fingernails with the point of his staff. “Then each of you agrees that he will disagree with whatever each of you agrees with,” said Milo triumphantly; “and if you both disagree with the same thing, then aren’t you really in agreement?” “I’VE BEEN TRICKED!” cried the Mathemagician helplessly, for no matter how he figured, it still came out just that way. “Splendid effort,” commented the Humbug jovially; “exactly the way I would have done it myself.” “And now may we go?” added Tock. The Mathemagician accepted his defeat with grace, nodded weakly, and then drew the three travelers to his side. “It’s a long and dangerous journey,” he began softly, and a furrow of concern creased his forehead. “Long before you find them, the demons will know you’re there. Watch for them well,” he emphasized, “for when they appear, it might be too late.” The Humbug shuddered down to his shoes, and Milo felt the tips of his fingers suddenly grow cold. “But there is one problem even more serious than that,” he whispered ominously. “What is it?” gasped Milo, who was not sure he really wanted to know. “I’m afraid I can tell you only when you return. Come along,” said the Mathemagician, “and I’ll show you the way.” And, simply by carrying the three, he transported them all to the very edge of Digitopolis. Behind them lay all the kingdoms of Wisdom, and up ahead a narrow rutted path led toward the mountains and darkness. “We’ll never get the car up that,” said Milo unhappily. “True enough,” replied the Mathemagician, “but you can be in Ignorance quick enough without riding all the way; and if you’re to be successful, it will have to be step by step.” “But I would like to take my gifts,” he insisted. “So you shall,” announced the Dodecahedron, who appeared from nowhere with his arms full. “Here are your sights, here are your sounds, and here,” he said, handing Milo the last of them disdainfully, “are your words.” “And, most important of all,” added the Mathemagician, “here is your own magic staff. Use it well and there is nothing it cannot do for you.” He placed in Milo’s breast pocket a small gleaming pencil which, except for the size, was much like his own. Then, with a last word of encouragement, he and the Dodecahedron (who was simultaneously sobbing, frowning, pining, and sighing from four of his saddest faces) made their farewells and watched as the three tiny figures disappeared into the forbidding mountains of Ignorance. Almost immediately the light began to fade as the difficult path wandered aimlessly upward, inching forward almost as reluctantly as the trembling Humbug. Tock as usual led the way, sniffing ahead for danger, and Milo, his bag of precious possessions slung over one shoulder, followed silently and resolutely behind. “Perhaps someone should stay back to guard the way,” said the unhappy bug, offering his services; but, since his suggestion was met with silence, he followed glumly along. The higher they went, the darker it became, though it wasn’t the darkness of night, but rather more like a mixture of lurking shadows and evil intentions which oozed from the slimy moss-covered cliffs and blotted out the light. A cruel wind shrieked through the rocks and the air was thick and heavy, as if it had been used several times before. On they went, higher and higher up the dizzying trail, on one side the sheer stone walls and brutal peaks towering above them, and on the other an endless, limitless, bottomless nothing. “I can hardly see a thing,” said Milo, taking hold of Tock’s tail as a sticky mist engulfed the moon. “Perhaps we should wait until morning.” “They’ll be mourning for you soon enough,” came a reply from directly above, and this was followed by a hideous cackling laugh very much like someone choking on a fishbone. Clinging to one of the greasy rocks and blending almost perfectly with it was a large, unkempt, and exceedingly soiled bird who looked more like a dirty floor mop than anything else. He had a sharp, dangerous beak, and the one eye he chose to open stared down maliciously. “I don’t think you understand,” said Milo timidly as the watchdog growled a warning. “We’re looking for a place to spend the night.” “It’s not yours to spend,” the bird shrieked again, and followed it with the same horrible laugh. “That doesn’t make any sense, you see—” he started to explain. “Dollars or cents, it’s still not yours to spend,” the bird replied haughtily. “But I didn’t mean—” insisted Milo. “Of course you’re mean,” interrupted the bird, closing the eye that had been open and opening the one that had been closed. “Anyone who’d spend a night that doesn’t belong to him is very mean.” “Well, I thought that by—” he tried again desperately. “That’s a different story,” interjected the bird a bit more amiably. “If you want to buy, I’m sure I can arrange to sell, but with what you’re doing you’ll probably end up in a cell anyway.” “That doesn’t seem right,” said Milo helplessly, for, with the bird taking everything the wrong way, he hardly knew what he was saying. “Agreed,” said the bird, with a sharp click of his beak, “but neither is it left, although if I were you I would have left a long time ago.” “Let me try once more,” he said in an effort to explain. “In other words—” “You mean you have other words?” cried the bird happily. “Well, by all means, use them. You’re certainly not doing very well with the ones you have now.” “Must you always interrupt like that?” said Tock irritably, for even he was becoming impatient. “Naturally,” he cackled; “it’s my job. I take the words right out of your mouth. Haven’t we met before? I’m the Everpresent Wordsnatcher, and I’m sure I know your friend the bug.” And then he leaned all the way forward and gave a terrible knowing smile. The Humbug, who was too big to hide and too frightened to move, denied everything. “Is everyone who lives in Ignorance like you?” asked Milo. “Much worse,” he said longingly. “But I don’t live here. I’m from a place very far away called Context.” “Don’t you think you should be getting back?” suggested the bug, holding one arm up in front of him. “What a horrible thought.” The bird shuddered. “It’s such an unpleasant place that I spend almost all my time out of it. Besides, what could be nicer than these grimy mountains?” “Almost anything,” thought Milo as he pulled his collar up. And then he asked the bird, “Are you a demon?” “I’m afraid not,” he replied sadly, as several filthy tears rolled down his beak. “I’ve tried, but the best I can manage to be is a nuisance,” and, before Milo could reply, he flapped his dingy wings and flew off in a cascade of dust and dirt and fuzz. “Wait!” shouted Milo, who’d thought of many more questions he wanted to ask. “Thirty-four pounds,” shrieked the bird as he disappeared into the fog. “He was certainly no help,” said Milo after they had been walking again for some time. “That’s why I drove him off,” cried the Humbug, fiercely brandishing his cane. “Now let’s find the demons.” “That might be sooner than you think,” remarked Tock, looking back at the suddenly trembling bug; and the trail turned again and continued to climb. In a few minutes they’d reached the crest, only to find that beyond it lay another one even higher, and beyond that several more, whose tops were lost in the swirling darkness. For a short stretch the path became broad and flat, and just ahead, leaning comfortably against a dead tree, stood a very elegant-looking gentleman. He was beautifully dressed in a dark suit with a well-pressed shirt and tie. His shoes were polished, his nails were clean, his hat was well brushed, and a white handkerchief adorned his breast pocket. But his expression was somewhat blank. In fact, it was completely blank, for he had neither eyes, nose, nor mouth. “Hello, little boy,” he said, amiably shaking Milo by the hand. “And how’s the faithful dog?” he inquired, giving Tock three or four strong and friendly pats. “And who is this handsome creature?” he asked, tipping his hat to the very pleased Humbug. “I’m so happy to see you all.” “What a pleasant surprise to meet someone so nice,” they all thought, “and especially here.” “I wonder if you could spare me a little of your time,” he inquired politely, “and help with a few small jobs?” “Why, of course,” said the Humbug cheerfully. “Gladly,” added Tock. “Yes, indeed,” said Milo, who wondered for just a moment how it was possible for someone so agreeable to have a face with no features at all. “Splendid,” he said happily, “for there are just three tasks. Firstly, I would like to move this pile from here to there,” he explained, pointing to an enormous mound of fine sand; “but I’m afraid that all I have is this tiny tweezers.” And he gave them to Milo, who immediately began transporting one grain at a time. “Secondly, I would like to empty this well and fill the other; but I have no bucket, so you’ll have to use this eye dropper.” And he handed it to Tock, who undertook at once to carry one drop at a time from well to well. “And, lastly, I must have a hole through this cliff, and here is a needle to dig it.” The eager Humbug quickly set to work picking at the solid granite wall. When they had all been safely started, the very pleasant man returned to the tree and, leaning against it once more, continued to stare vacantly down the trail, while Milo, Tock, and the Humbug worked hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour after hour— 17. Unwelcoming Committee The Humbug whistled gaily at his work, for he was never as happy as when he had a job which required no thinking at all. After what seemed like days, he had dug a hole scarcely large enough for his thumb. Tock shuffled steadily back and forth with the dropper in his teeth, but the full well was still almost as full as when he began, and Milo’s new pile of sand was hardly a pile at all. “How very strange,” said Milo, without stopping for a moment. “I’ve been working steadily all this time, and I don’t feel the slightest bit tired or hungry. I could go right on the same way forever.” “Perhaps you will,” the man agreed with a yawn (at least it sounded like a yawn). “Well, I wish I knew how long it was going to take,” Milo whispered as the dog went by again. “Why not use your magic staff and find out?” replied Tock as clearly as anyone could with an eye dropper in his mouth. Milo took the shiny pencil from his pocket and quickly calculated that, at the rate they were working, it would take each of them eight hundred and thirty-seven years to finish. “Pardon me,” he said, tugging at the man’s sleeve and holding the sheet of figures up for him to see, “but it’s going to take eight hundred and thirty-seven years to do these jobs.” “Is that so?” replied the man, without even turning around. “Well, you’d better get on with it then.” “But it hardly seems worth while,” said Milo softly. “WORTH WHILE!” the man roared indignantly. “All I meant was that perhaps it isn’t too important,” Milo repeated, trying not to be impolite. “Of course it’s not important,” he snarled angrily. “I wouldn’t have asked you to do it if I thought it was important.” And now, as he turned to face them, he didn’t seem quite so pleasant. “Then why bother?” asked Tock, whose alarm suddenly began to ring. “Because, my young friends,” he muttered sourly, “what could be more important than doing unimportant things? If you stop to do enough of them, you’ll never get to where you’re going.” He punctuated his last remark with a villainous laugh. “Then you must—” gasped Milo. “Quite correct!” he shrieked triumphantly. “I am the Terrible Trivium, demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs, ogre of wasted effort, and monster of habit.” The Humbug dropped his needle and stared in disbelief while Milo and Tock began to back away slowly. “Don’t try to leave,” he ordered, with a menacing sweep of his arm, “for there’s so very much to do, and you still have over eight hundred years to go on the first job.” “But why do only unimportant things?” asked Milo, who suddenly remembered how much time he spent each day doing them. “Think of all the trouble it saves,” the man explained, and his face looked as if he’d be grinning an evil grin—if he could grin at all. “If you only do the easy and useless jobs, you’ll never have to worry about the important ones which are so difficult. You just won’t have the time. For there’s always something to do to keep you from what you really should be doing, and if it weren’t for that dreadful magic staff, you’d never know how much time you were wasting.” As he spoke, he tiptoed slowly toward them with his arms outstretched and continued to whisper in a soft, deceitful voice, “Now do come and stay with me. We’ll have so much fun together. There are things to fill and things to empty, things to take away and things to bring back, things to pick up and things to put down, and besides all that we have pencils to sharpen, holes to dig, nails to straighten, stamps to lick, and ever so much more. Why, if you stay here, you’ll never have to think again—and with a little practice you can become a monster of habit, too.” They were all transfixed by the Trivium’s soothing voice, but just as he was about to clutch them in his well-manicured fingers a voice cried out, “RUN! RUN!” Milo, who thought it was Tock, turned suddenly and dashed up the trail. “RUN! RUN!” it shouted again, and this time Tock thought it was Milo and quickly followed him. “RUN! RUN!” it urged once more, and now the Humbug, not caring who said it, ran desperately after his two friends, with the Terrible Trivium close behind. “This way! This way!” the voice called again. They turned in its direction and scrambled up the difficult slippery rocks, sliding back at each step almost as far as they’d gone forward. With a great effort and many helping paws from Tock, they reached the top of the ridge at last, but only two steps ahead of the furious Trivium. “Over here! Over here!” advised the voice, and without a moment’s hesitation they started through a puddle of sticky ooze, which quickly became ankle-deep, then knee-deep, then hip-deep, until finally they were struggling along through what felt very much like a waist-deep pool of peanut butter. The Trivium, who had discovered a mound of pebbles which needed counting, followed no more, but stood at the edge shaking his fist, shouting horrible threats, and promising to rouse every demon in the mountains. “What a nasty fellow,” gasped Milo, who was having great difficulty just getting his legs to move. “I hope I never meet him again.” “I believe he’s stopped chasing us,” said the bug, looking back over his shoulder. “It’s not what’s behind that worries me,” remarked Tock as they stepped from the sticky mess, “but what’s ahead.” “Keep going straight! Keep going straight!” counseled the voice as they continued to pick their way carefully along the new path. “Now step up! Now step up!” it recommended, and almost before they knew what had happened, they had all taken a step up and then plunged to the bottom of a deep murky pit. “But he said up!” Milo complained bitterly from where he lay sprawling. “Well, I hope you didn’t expect to get anywhere by listening to me,” said the voice gleefully. “We’ll never get out of here,” the Humbug moaned, looking at the steep, smooth sides of the pit. “That is quite an accurate evaluation of the situation,” said the voice coldly. “Then why did you help us at all?” shouted Milo angrily. “Oh, I’d do as much for anybody,” he replied; “bad advice is my specialty. For, as you can plainly see, I’m the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired, wide-mouthed, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, round-bodied, short-armed, bowlegged, big-footed monster—and, if I do say so myself, one of the most frightening fiends in this whole wild wilderness. With me here, you wouldn’t dare try to escape.” And, with that, he shuffled to the edge of the pit and leered down at his helpless prisoners. Tock and the Humbug turned away in fright, but Milo, who had learned by now that people are not always what they say they are, reached for his telescope and took a long look for himself. And there at the rim of the hole, instead of what he’d expected, stood a small furry creature with very worried eyes and a rather sheepish grin. “Why, you’re not long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired, wide-mouthed, thicknecked, broad-shouldered, round-bodied, short-armed, bowlegged, or big-footed— and you’re not at all frightening,” said Milo indignantly. “What kind of a demon are you?” The little creature, who seemed stunned at being found out, leaped back out of sight and began to whimper softly. “I’m the demon of insincerity,” he sobbed. “I don’t mean what I say, I don’t mean what I do, and I don’t mean what I am. Most people who believe what I tell them go the wrong way, and stay there, but you and your awful telescope have spoiled everything. I’m going home.” And, crying hysterically, he stamped off in a huff. “It certainly pays to have a good look at things,” observed Milo as he wrapped up the telescope with great care. “Now all we have to do is climb out,” said Tock, placing his front paws as high on the wall as he could. “Here, hop up on my back.” Milo climbed onto the dog’s shoulders. Then the bug crawled up both of them and, by standing on Milo’s head, just managed to hook his cane on the root of an old gnarled tree. With loud complaints he hung on doggedly until the other two had climbed out over him and pulled him up, somewhat dazed and discouraged. “I’ll lead the way for a while,” he said, brushing himself off. “Follow me and we’ll stay out of trouble.” He guided them along one of five narrow ledges, all of which led to a grooved and rutted plateau. They stopped for a moment to rest and make plans, but before they had done either the whole mountain trembled violently and, with a sudden lurch, rose high into the air, carrying them along with it. For, quite accidentally, they had stepped into the callused hand of the Gelatinous Giant. “AND WHAT HAVE WE HERE!” he roared, looking curiously at the tiny figures huddled in his palm—and licking his lips. He was an incredible size even sitting down, with long unkempt hair, bulging eyes, and a shape hardly worth speaking of. He looked, in fact, very much like a colossal bowl of jelly, without the bowl. “HOW DARE YOU DISTURB MY NAP!” he bellowed furiously, and the force of his hot breath tumbled them over in his hand. “We’re terribly sorry,” said Milo meekly, when he’d untangled himself, “but you looked just like part of the mountain.” “Naturally,” the giant replied in a more normal voice (but even this was like an explosion). “I have no shape of my own, so I try to be just like whatever I’m near. In the mountains I’m a lofty peak, on the beach a broad sand bar, in the forest a towering oak, and sometimes in the city I’m a very handsome twelve-story apartment house. I just hate to be conspicuous; it’s really not safe, you know.” Then he looked at them again with hungry eyes and wondered how well they’d taste. “You look much too big to be afraid of anything,” said Milo quickly, for the giant had already begun to open his mouth wide. “I’m not,” he said, with a slight shiver that ran all over his gelatinous body. “I’m afraid of everything. That’s why I’m so ferocious. If the others found out, I’d just die. Now do be quiet while I eat my breakfast.” He raised his hand toward his gaping mouth and the Humbug shut his eyes tightly and clasped both hands over his head. “Then aren’t you really a fearful demon?” Milo asked desperately, on the assumption that the giant had been brought up well enough not to talk with a mouthful. “Well, approximately yes,” he replied, lowering his arm to the vast relief of the bug; “that is, comparatively no. What I mean is, relatively maybe—in other words, roughly perhaps. What does everyone else think? There, you see,” he said peevishly; “I’m even afraid to make a positive statement. So please stop asking questions before I lose my appetite altogether.” Then he raised his arm again and prepared to swallow the three of them in one gulp. “Why don’t you help us rescue Rhyme and Reason? Then maybe things will get better,” shouted Milo again, this time almost too late, for in another instant they would have all been gone. “Oh, I wouldn’t do that,” said the Giant thoughtfully, lowering his arm once more. “I mean, why not leave well enough alone? That is, it’ll never work. I wouldn’t take a chance. In other words, let’s keep things as they are—changes are so frightening.” As he spoke he began to look a bit ill. “Maybe I’ll just eat one of you,” he remarked unhappily, “and save the rest for later. I don’t feel very well.” “I have a better idea,” said Milo. “You do?” interrupted the giant, losing any desire to eat at all. “If it’s one thing I can’t swallow, it’s ideas: they’re so hard to digest.” “I have a box full of all the ideas in the world,” said Milo, proudly holding up the gift King Azaz had given him. The thought of it terrified the giant, who began to shake like an enormous pudding. “PUT ME DOWN AND JUST GO AWAY,” he pleaded, forgetting for a moment who had hold of whom; “AND PLEASE DON’T OPEN THAT BOX!” In another moment he’d set them down on the next jagged peak and, with panic in his eyes, lumbered off to warn the others of this terrible new threat. But news travels quickly. The Wordsnatcher, the Trivium, and the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired, wide-mouthed, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, roundbodied, short-armed, bowlegged, big-footed monster had already spread the alarm throughout the evil, unenlightened mountains. And out the demons came—from every cave and crevice, through every fissure and crack, from under the rocks and up from the mud, stomping and shuffling, slithering and sliding, through the murky shadows. And all had only one thought in mind: destroy the intruders and protect Ignorance. From where they stood, Milo, Tock, and the Humbug could see them moving steadily forward, still far away but coming quickly. On all sides the cliffs were alive with this evil collection of crawling, looming, creeping, lurching shapes. Some could be seen plainly, others were but dim silhouettes, and yet still more, only now beginning to stir from their foul places, would be along much sooner than they were wanted. “We’d better hurry,” barked Tock, “or they’re sure to catch us.” And he started up the trail again. Milo took one deep breath and did the same; and the bug, now that he knew what lay behind, ran ahead with renewed enthusiasm. 18. Castle in the Air Higher and higher they climbed, in search of the castle and the two banished princesses—from one crest to the next, from jagged rock to jagged rock, up frightful crumbling cliffs and along desperately narrow ledges where a single misstep meant only good-by. An ominous silence dropped like a curtain around them and, except for the scuffling of their frantic footsteps, there wasn’t a sound. The world that Milo knew was a million thoughts away, and the demons—the demons were there in the distance. “They’re gaining!” shouted the Humbug, wishing he’d never looked back. “But there it is!” cried Milo at the same instant, for straight ahead, climbing up from atop the highest peak, was a spidery spiral stair, and at the other end stood the Castle in the Air. “I see it, I see it,” said the happy bug as they struggled up the twisting mountain trail. But what he didn’t see was that, curled up right in front of the first step, was a little round man in a frock coat, sleeping peacefully on a very large and well-worn ledger. A long quill pen sat precariously behind his ear, there were inkstains all over his hands and face as well as his clothing, and he wore a pair of the thickest eyeglasses that Milo had ever seen. “Be very careful,” whispered Tock when they’d finally reached the top, and the Humbug stepped gingerly around and started up the stairs. “NAMES?” the little man called out briskly, just as the startled bug reached the first step. He sat up quickly, pulled the book out from under him, put on a green eye-shade, and waited with his pen poised in the air. “Well, I—” stammered the bug. “NAMES?” he cried again, and as he did he opened the book to page 512 and began to write furiously. The quill made horrible scratching noises, and the point, which was continually catching in the paper, flicked tiny inkblots all over him. As they called out their names, he noted them carefully in alphabetical order. “Splendid, splendid, splendid,” he muttered to himself. “I haven’t had an M in ages.” “What do you want our names for?” asked Milo, looking anxiously over his shoulder. “We’re in a bit of a hurry.” “Oh, this won’t take a minute,” the man assured them. “I’m the official Senses Taker, and I must have some information before I can take your senses. Now, if you’ll just tell me when you were born, where you were born, why you were born, how old you are now, how old you were then, how old you’ll be in a little while, your mother’s name, your father’s name, your aunt’s name, your uncle’s name, your cousin’s name, where you live, how long you’ve lived there, the schools you’ve attended, the schools you haven’t attended, your hobbies, your telephone number, your shoe size, shirt size, collar size, hat size, and the names and addresses of six people who can verify all this information, we’ll get started. One at a time, please; stand in line; and no pushing, no talking, no peeking.” The Humbug, who had difficulty remembering anything, went first. The little man leisurely recorded each answer in five different places, pausing often to polish his glasses, clear his throat, straighten his tie, and blow his nose. He managed also to cover the distressed bug from head to foot in ink. “NEXT!” he announced very officially. “I do wish he’d hurry,” said Milo, stepping forward, for in the distance he could see the first of the demons already beginning to scale the mountain toward them, no more than a few minutes away. The little man wrote with painful deliberation, finally finished with both Milo and Tock, and looked up happily. “May we go now?” asked the dog, whose sensitive nose had picked up a loathsome, evil smell that grew stronger every second. “By all means,” said the man agreeably, “just as soon as you finish telling me your height; your weight; the number of books you read each year; the number of books you don’t read each year; the amount of time you spend eating, playing, working, and sleeping every day; where you go on vacations; how many ice-cream cones you eat in a week; how far it is from your house to the barbershop; and which is your favorite color. Then, after that, please fill out these forms and applications— three copies of each—and be careful, for if you make one mistake, you’ll have to do them all over again.” “Oh dear,” said Milo, looking at the pile of papers, “we’ll never finish these.” And even as he spoke the demons swarmed stealthily up the mountain. “Come, come,” said the Senses Taker, chuckling gaily to himself, “don’t take all day. I’m expecting several more visitors any minute now.” They set to work feverishly on the difficult forms, and when they’d finished, Milo placed them all in the little man’s lap. He thanked them politely, took off his eye-shade, put the pen behind his ear, closed the book, and went back to sleep. The Humbug took one horrified look back over his shoulder and quickly started up the stairs. “DESTINATION?” shouted the Senses Taker, sitting up again, putting on his eyeshade, taking the pen from behind his ear, and opening his book. “But I thought—” protested the astonished bug. “DESTINATION?” he repeated, making several notations in the ledger. “The Castle in the Air,” said Milo impatiently. “Why bother?” said the Senses Taker, pointing into the distance. “I’m sure you’d rather see what I have to show you.” As he spoke, they all looked up, but only Milo could see the gay and exciting circus there on the horizon. There were tents and side shows and rides and even wild animals—everything a little boy could spend hours watching. “And wouldn’t you enjoy a more pleasant aroma?” he said, turning to Tock. Almost immediately the dog smelled a wonderful smell that no one but he could smell. It was made up of all the marvelous things that had ever delighted his curious nose. “And here’s something I know you’ll enjoy hearing,” he assured the Humbug. The bug listened with rapt attention to something he alone could hear—the shouts and applause of an enormous crowd, all cheering for him. They each stood as if in a trance, looking, smelling, and listening to the very special things that the Senses Taker had provided for them, forgetting completely about where they were going and who, with evil intent, was coming up behind them. The Senses Taker sat back with a satisfied smile on his puffy little face as the demons came closer and closer, until less than a minute separated them from their helpless victims. But Milo was too engrossed in the circus to notice, and Tock had closed his eyes, the better to smell, and the bug, bowing and waving, stood with a look of sheer bliss on his face, interested only in the wild ovation. The little man had done his work well and, except for some ominous crawling noises just below the crest of the mountain, everything was again silent. Milo, who stood staring blankly into the distance, let his bag of gifts slip from his shoulder to the ground. And, as he did, the package of sounds broke open, filling the air with peals of happy laughter which seemed so gay that first he, then Tock, and finally the Humbug joined in. And suddenly the spell was broken. “There is no circus,” cried Milo, realizing he’d been tricked. “There were no smells,” barked Tock, his alarm now ringing furiously. “The applause is gone,” complained the disappointed Humbug. “I warned you; I warned you I was the Senses Taker,” sneered the Senses Taker. “I help people find what they’re not looking for, hear what they’re not listening for, run after what they’re not chasing, and smell what isn’t even there. And, furthermore,” he cackled, hopping around gleefully on his stubby legs, “I’ll steal your sense of purpose, take your sense of duty, destroy your sense of proportion—and, but for one thing, you’d be helpless yet.” “What’s that?” asked Milo fearfully. “As long as you have the sound of laughter,” he groaned unhappily, “I cannot take your sense of humor—and, with it, you’ve nothing to fear from me.” “But what about THEM?” cried the terrified bug, for at that very instant the other demons had reached the top at last and were leaping forward to seize them. They ran for the stairs, bowling over the disconsolate Senses Taker, ledger, ink bottle, eyeshade, and all, as they went. The Humbug dashed up first, then Tock, and lastly Milo, almost too late, as a scaly arm brushed his shoe. The dangerous stairs danced dizzily in the wind, and the clumsy demons refused to follow; but they howled with rage and fury, swore bloody vengeance, and watched with many pairs of burning eyes as the three small shapes vanished slowly into the clouds. “Don’t look down,” advised Milo as the bug tottered upward on unsteady legs. Like a giant corkscrew, the stairway twisted through the darkness, steep and narrow and with no rail to guide them. The wind howled cruelly in an effort to tear them loose, and the fog dragged clammy fingers down their backs; but up the giddy flight they went, each one helping the others, until at last the clouds parted, the darkness fell away, and a glow of golden sunrays warmed their arrival. The castle gate swung smoothly open, and on a rug as soft as a snowdrift they entered the great hall and they stood shyly waiting. “Come right in, please; we’ve been expecting you,” sang out two sweet voices in unison. At the far end of the hall a silver curtain parted and two young women stepped forward. They were dressed all in white and were beautiful beyond compare. One was grave and quiet, with a look of warm understanding in her eyes, and the other seemed gay and joyful. “You must be the Princess of Pure Reason,” said Milo, bowing to the first. She answered simply, “Yes,” and that was just enough. “Then you are Sweet Rhyme,” he said, with a smile to the other. Her eyes sparkled brightly and she answered with a laugh as friendly as the mailman’s ring when you know there’s a letter for you. “We’ve come to rescue you both,” Milo explained very seriously. “And the demons are close behind,” said the worried Humbug, still shaky from his ordeal. “And we should leave right away,” advised Tock. “Oh, they won’t dare come up here,” said Reason gently; “and we’ll be down there soon enough.” “Why not sit for a moment and rest?” suggested Rhyme. “I’m sure you must be tired. Have you been traveling long?” “Days,” sighed the exhausted dog, curling up on a large downy cushion. “Weeks,” corrected the bug, flopping into a deep comfortable armchair, for it did seem that way to him. “It has been a long trip,” said Milo, climbing onto the couch where the princesses sat; “but we would have been here much sooner if I hadn’t made so many mistakes. I’m afraid it’s all my fault.” “You must never feel badly about making mistakes,” explained Reason quietly, “as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons.” “But there’s so much to learn,” he said, with a thoughtful frown. “Yes, that’s true,” admitted Rhyme; “but it’s not just learning things that’s important. It’s learning what to do with what you learn and learning why you learn things at all that matters.” “That’s just what I mean,” explained Milo, as Tock and the exhausted bug drifted quietly off to sleep. “Many of the things I’m supposed to know seem so useless that I can’t see the purpose in learning them at all.” “You may not see it now,” said the Princess of Pure Reason, looking knowingly at Milo’s puzzled face, “but whatever we learn has a purpose and whatever we do affects everything and everyone else, if even in the tiniest way. Why, when a housefly flaps his wings, a breeze goes round the world; when a speck of dust falls to the ground, the entire planet weighs a little more; and when you stamp your foot, the earth moves slightly off its course. Whenever you laugh, gladness spreads like the ripples in a pond; and whenever you’re sad, no one anywhere can be really happy. And it’s much the same thing with knowledge, for whenever you learn something new, the whole world becomes that much richer.” “And remember, also,” added the Princess of Sweet Rhyme, “that many places you would like to see are just off the map and many things you want to know are just out of sight or a little beyond your reach. But someday you’ll reach them all, for what you learn today, for no reason at all, will help you discover all the wonderful secrets of tomorrow.” “I think I understand,” he said, still full of questions and thoughts; “but which is the most important—” At that moment the conversation was interrupted by a far-off chopping noise. With each loud blow, the entire room and everything in it shook and rattled. Down below, on the murky peak, the demons were busily cutting the stairway loose with axes and hammers and saws. Before long the whole thing collapsed with a tremendous crash and the startled Humbug leaped to his feet just in time to see the castle drifting slowly off into space. “We’re moving!” he shouted, which was a fact that had already become obvious to everyone. “I think we had better leave now,” said Rhyme softly, and Reason agreed with a nod. “But how will we get down?” groaned the Humbug, looking at the wreckage below. “There’s no stairway and we’re sailing higher every minute.” “Well, time flies, doesn’t it?” asked Milo. “On many occasions,” barked Tock, jumping eagerly to his feet. “I’ll take everyone down.” “Can you carry us all?” inquired the bug. “For a short distance,” said the dog thoughtfully. “The princesses can ride on my back, Milo can catch hold of my tail, and you can hang on to his ankles.” “But what of the Castle in the Air?” the bug objected, not very pleased with the arrangement. “Let it drift away,” said Rhyme. “And good riddance,” added Reason, “for no matter how beautiful it seems, it’s still nothing but a prison.” Tock then backed up three steps and, with a running start, bounded through the window with all his passengers and began the long glide down. The princesses sat tall and unafraid, Milo held on as tight as he could, and the bug swung crazily, like the tail on a kite. Down through the darkness they plunged, to the mountains and the monsters below. 19. The Return of Rhyme and Reason Sailing past three of the tallest peaks, and just over the outstretched arms of the grasping demons, they reached the ground and landed with a sudden jolt. “Quick!” urged Tock. “Follow me! We’ll have to run for it.” With the princesses still on his back, he galloped down the rocky trail—and not a moment too soon. For, pounding down the mountainside, in a cloud of clinging dust and a chorus of chilling shrieks, came all the loathsome creatures who choose to live in Ignorance and who had waited so very impatiently. Thick black clouds hung heavily overhead as they fled through the darkness, and Milo, looking back for just a moment, could see the awful shapes coming closer and closer. Just to the left, and not very far away, were the Triple Demons of Compromise—one tall and thin, one short and fat, and the third exactly like the other two. As always, they moved in ominous circles, for if one said “here,” the other said “there,” and the third agreed perfectly with both of them. And, since they always settled their differences by doing what none of them really wanted, they rarely got anywhere at all—and neither did anyone they met. Jumping clumsily from boulder to boulder and catching hold with his cruel, curving claws was the Horrible Hopping Hindsight, a most unpleasant fellow whose eyes were in the rear and whose rear was out in front. He invariably leaped before he looked and never cared where he was going as long as he knew why he shouldn’t have gone to where he’d been. And, most terrifying of all, directly behind, inching along like giant soft-shelled snails, with blazing eyes and wet anxious mouths, came the Gorgons of Hate and Malice, leaving a trail of slime behind them and moving much more quickly than you’d think. “FASTER!” shouted Tock. “They’re closing in.” Down from the heights they raced, the Humbug with one hand on his hat and the other flailing desperately in the air, Milo running as he never ran before, and the demons just a little bit faster than that. From off on the right, his heavy bulbous body lurching dangerously on the spindly legs which barely supported him, came the Overbearing Know-it-all, talking continuously. A dismal demon who was mostly mouth, he was ready at a moment’s notice to offer misinformation on any subject. And, while he often tumbled heavily, it was never he who was hurt, but, rather, the unfortunate person on whom he fell. Next to him, but just a little behind, came the Gross Exaggeration, whose grotesque features and thoroughly unpleasant manners were hideous to see, and whose rows of wicked teeth were made only to mangle the truth. They hunted together, and were bad luck to anyone they caught. Riding along on the back of anyone who’d carry him was the Threadbare Excuse, a small, pathetic figure whose clothes were worn and tattered and who mumbled the same things again and again, in a low but piercing voice: “Well, I’ve been sick—but the page was torn out—I missed the bus—but no one else did it— well, I’ve been sick—but the page was torn out—I missed the bus—but no one else did it.” He looked quite harmless and friendly but, once he grabbed on, he almost never let go. Closer and closer they came, bumping and jolting each other, clawing and snorting in their eager fury. Tock staggered along bravely with Rhyme and Reason, Milo’s lungs now felt ready to burst as he stumbled down the trail, and the Humbug was slowly falling behind. Gradually the path grew broader and more flat as it reached the bottom of the mountain and turned toward Wisdom. Ahead lay light and safety—but perhaps just a bit too far away. And down came the demons from everywhere, frenzied creatures of darkness, lurching wildly toward their prey. From off in the rear, the Terrible Trivium and the wobbly Gelatinous Giant urged them on with glee. And pounding forward with a rush came the ugly Dilemma, snorting steam and looking intently for someone to catch on the ends of his long pointed horns, while his hoofs bit eagerly at the ground. The exhausted Humbug swayed and tottered on his rubbery legs, a look of longing on his anguished face. “I don’t think I can—” he gasped, as a jagged slash of lightning ripped open the sky and the thunder stole his words. Closer and closer the demons loomed as the desperate chase neared its end. Then, gathering themselves for one final leap, they prepared to engulf first the bug, then the boy, and lastly the dog and his two passengers. They rose as one and— And suddenly stopped, as if frozen in mid-air, unable to move, staring ahead in terror. Milo slowly raised his weary head, and there in the horizon, for as far as the eye could see, stood the massed armies of Wisdom, the sun glistening from their swords and shields, and their bright banners slapping proudly at the breeze. For a moment everything was silent. Then a thousand trumpets sounded—then a thousand more—and, like an ocean wave, the long line of horsemen advanced, slowly at first, then faster and faster, until with a gallop and a shout, which was music to Milo’s ears, they swept forward toward the horrified demons. There in the lead was King Azaz, his dazzling armor embossed with every letter in the alphabet, and, with him, the Mathemagician, brandishing a freshly sharpened staff. From his tiny wagon, Dr. Dischord hurled explosion after explosion, to the delight of the Sound-keeper, while the busy DYNNE collected them almost at once. And, in honor of the occasion, Chroma the Great led his orchestra in a stirring display of patriotic colors. Everyone Milo had met during his journey had come to help—the men of the market place, the miners of Digitopolis, and all the good people from the valley and the forest. The Spelling Bee buzzed excitedly overhead shouting, “Charge—c-h-a-r-g-e— charge—c-h-a-r-g-e.” Canby, who, as everyone knew, was as cowardly as can be, came all the way from Conclusions to show that he was also as brave. And even Officer Shrift, mounted proudly on a long, low dachshund, galloped grimly along. Cringing with fear, the monsters of Ignorance turned in flight and, with anguished cries too horrible ever to forget, returned to the damp, dark places from which they came. The Humbug sighed with relief, and Milo and the princesses prepared to greet the victorious army. “Well done,” stated the Duke of Definition, dismounting and grasping Milo’s hand warmly. “Fine job,” seconded the Minister of Meaning. “Good Work,” added the Count of Connotation. “Congratulations,” proposed the Earl of Essence. “CHEERS,” recommended the Undersecretary of Understanding. And, since that’s exactly what everyone felt like doing, that’s exactly what everyone did. “It’s we who should thank—” began Milo, when the shouting had subsided, but, before he could finish, they had unrolled an enormous scroll. And, with a fanfare of trumpets and drums, they stated in order that: “Henceforth,” “And forthwith,” “Let it be known by all men” “That Rhyme and Reason” “Reign once more in Wisdom.” The two princesses bowed gratefully and warmly kissed their brothers, and they all agreed that a very fine thing had happened. “And furthermore,” continued the proclamation, “The boy named Milo,” “The dog known as Tock,” “And the insect hereinafter referred to as the Humbug” “Are hereby declared to be” “Heroes of the realm.” Cheer after cheer filled the air, and even the bug seemed a bit embarrassed at having so much attention paid to him. “Therefore,” concluded the duke, “In honor of their glorious deed, a royal holiday is declared. Let there be parades through every city in the land and a gala carnival of three days’ duration, consisting of jousts, games, feasts, and follies.” The five cabinet members then rolled up the large parchment and, with many bows and flourishes, retired. Swift horsemen carried the news to every corner of the kingdom, and, as the parade slowly wound its way through the countryside, crowds of people gathered to cheer it along. Garlands of flowers hung from every house and shop and carpeted the streets. Even the air shimmered with excitement, and shutters closed for many years were thrown open to let the brilliant sunlight shine where it hadn’t shone in so long. Milo, Tock, and the very subdued Humbug sat proudly in the royal carriage with Azaz, the Mathemagician, and the two princesses; and the parade stretched for miles in both directions. As the cheering continued, Rhyme leaned forward and touched Milo gently on the arm. “They’re shouting for you,” she said with a smile. “But I could never have done it,” he objected, “without everyone else’s help.” “That may be true,” said Reason gravely, “but you had the courage to try; and what you can do is often simply a matter of what you will do.” “That’s why,” said Azaz, “there was one very important thing about your quest that we couldn’t discuss until you returned.” “I remember,” said Milo eagerly. “Tell me now.” “It was impossible,” said the king, looking at the Mathemagician. “Completely impossible,” said the Mathemagician, looking at the king. “Do you mean—” stammered the bug, who suddenly felt a bit faint. “Yes, indeed,” they repeated together; “but if we’d told you then, you might not have gone—and, as you’ve discovered, so many things are possible just as long as you don’t know they’re impossible.” And for the remainder of the ride Milo didn’t utter a sound. Finally, when they’d reached a broad, flat plain midway between Dictionopolis and Digitopolis, somewhat to the right of the Valley of Sound and a little to the left of the Forest of Sight, the long line of carriages and horsemen stopped, and the great carnival began. Gaily striped tents and pavilions sprang up everywhere as the workmen scurried about like ants. Within minutes there were racecourses and grandstands, side shows and refreshment booths, gaming fields, Ferris wheels, banners, bunting, and bedlam, almost without pause. The Mathemagician provided a continuous display of brilliant fireworks made up of exploding numbers which multiplied and divided with breath-taking results— the colors, of course, being supplied by Chroma and the noise by a deliriously happy Dr. Dischord. Thanks to the Soundkeeper, there was music and laughter and, for very brief moments, even a little silence. Alec Bings set up an enormous telescope and invited everyone to see the other side of the moon, and the Humbug wandered through the crowd accepting congratulations and recounting in great detail his brave exploits, most of which gained immeasurably in the telling. And each evening, just at sunset, a royal banquet was held. There was everything imaginable to eat. King Azaz had ordered a special supply of delicious words in all flavors and, for those who liked exotic foods, in all languages, too. The Mathemagician had provided innumerable platters of division dumplings, which Milo was very careful to avoid, for, no matter how many you ate, when you finished there was more on your plate than when you began. And, of course, following the meal came songs, epic poems, and speeches in praise of the princesses and the three gallant adventurers who had rescued them. King Azaz and the Mathemagician pledged that every year at this same time they would lead their armies to the mountains of Ignorance until not one demon remained, and everyone agreed that no finer carnival for no finer reason had ever been held in Wisdom. But even things as fine as all that must end sometime, and late on the afternoon of the third day the tents were struck, the pavilions were folded, and everything was packed ready to leave. “It’s time to go now,” said Reason, “for there is much to do.” And, as she spoke, Milo suddenly remembered his home. He wanted very much to go back, yet somehow he could not bear the thought of leaving. “And so you must say good-by,” said Rhyme, patting him gently on the cheek. “To everyone?” said Milo unhappily. He looked around slowly at all the friends he’d made, and he looked very hard so as not to forget any of them for even an instant. But mostly he looked at Tock and the Humbug, with whom he had shared so much—the perils, the dangers, the fears, and, best of all, the victory. Never had anyone had two more steadfast companions. “Can’t you both come with me?” he asked, knowing the answer as he said it. “I’m afraid not, old man,” replied the bug. “I’d like, to, but I’ve arranged a lecture tour which will keep me occupied for years.” “And they do need a watchdog here,” barked Tock sadly. Milo embraced the bug who, in his most typical fashion, was heard to mumble gruffly, “BAH,” but whose damp eyes told quite a different story. Then the boy threw his arms around Tock’s neck and, for just a moment, held on very tightly. “Thank you for everything you’ve taught me,” said Milo to everybody as a tear rolled down his cheek. “And thank you for what you’ve taught us,” said the king—and, as he clapped his hands, the little car was brought forward, polished like new. Milo got in and, with one last look, started down the road, with everyone waving him on. “Good-by,” he shouted. “Good-by. I’ll be back.” “Good-by,” shouted Azaz. “Always remember the importance of words.” “And numbers,” added the Mathemagician forcefully. “Surely you don’t think numbers are as important as words?” he heard Azaz shout from the distance. “Is that so?” replied the Mathemagician a little more faintly. “Why, if—” “Oh dear,” thought Milo; “I do hope they don’t start it all again.” And in a moment they had faded from sight as the road dipped, turned, and headed for home. 20. Good-by and Hello As the pleasant countryside flashed by and the wind whistled a tune on the windshield, it suddenly occurred to Milo that he must have been gone for several weeks. “I do hope that no one’s been worried,” he thought, urging the car on faster. “I’ve never been away this long before.” The late-afternoon sun had turned now from a vivid yellow to a warm lazy orange, and it seemed almost as tired as he was. The road raced ahead in a series of gentle curves that began to look familiar, and off in the distance the solitary tollbooth appeared, a welcome sight indeed. In a few minutes he reached the end of his journey, deposited his coin, and drove through. And, almost before realizing it, he was sitting in the middle of his own room again. “It’s only six o’clock,” he observed with a yawn, and then, in a moment, he made an even more interesting discovery. “And it’s still today! I’ve been gone for only an hour!” he cried in amazement, for he’d certainly never realized how much he could do in so short a time. Milo was much too tired to talk and almost too tired for dinner, so, without a murmur, he went off to bed as soon as he could. He pulled the covers around him, took a last look at his room—which somehow seemed very different than he’d remembered—and then drifted into a deep and welcome sleep. School went very quickly the next day, but not quickly enough, for Milo’s head was full of plans and his eyes could see nothing but the tollbooth and what lay beyond. He waited impatiently for the end of class, and when the time finally came, his feet raced his thoughts all the way back to the house. “Another trip! Another trip! I’ll leave right away. They’ll all be so glad to see me, and I’ll—” He stopped abruptly at the door of his room, for, where the tollbooth had been just the night before, there was now nothing at all. He searched frantically throughout the apartment, but it had vanished just as mysteriously as it had come— and in its place was another bright-blue envelope, which was addressed simply: “FOR MILO, WHO NOW KNOWS THE WAY.” He opened it quickly and read: Dear Milo, You have now completed your trip, courtesy of the Phantom Tollbooth. We trust that everything has been satisfactory, and hope you understand why we had to come and collect it. You see, there are so many other boys and girls waiting to use it, too. It’s true that there are many lands you’ve still to visit (some of which are not even on the map) and wonderful things to see (that no one has yet imagined), but we’re quite sure that if you really want to, you’ll find a way to reach them all by yourself. Yours truly, The signature was blurred and couldn’t be read. Milo walked sadly to the window and squeezed himself into one corner of the large armchair. He felt very lonely and desolate as his thoughts turned far away—to the foolish, lovable bug; to the comforting assurance of Tock, standing next to him; to the erratic, excitable DYNNE; to little Alec, who, he hoped, would someday reach the ground; to Rhyme and Reason, without whom Wisdom withered; and to the many, many others he would remember always. And yet, even as he thought of all these things, he noticed somehow that the sky was a lovely shade of blue and that one cloud had the shape of a sailing ship. The tips of the trees held pale, young buds and the leaves were a rich deep green. Outside the window, there was so much to see, and hear, and touch—walks to take, hills to climb, caterpillars to watch as they strolled through the garden. There were voices to hear and conversations to listen to in wonder, and the special smell of each day. And, in the very room in which he sat, there were books that could take you anywhere, and things to invent, and make, and build, and break, and all the puzzle and excitement of everything he didn’t know—music to play, songs to sing, and worlds to imagine and then someday make real. His thoughts darted eagerly about as everything looked new—and worth trying. “Well, I would like to make another trip,” he said, jumping to his feet; \\"but I really don’t know when I’ll have the time.

Gibt es performantete möglichkeiten als als array.sort((a, b) => b.count - a.count);?","completion":"Wenn dein Array eine sehr große Anzahl an Objekten enthält, deren \`count\`-Werte bereits vorwiegend sortiert sind oder wenn die Werte des \`count\`-Attributs nur in einem kleinen Bereich variieren, könnten spezifische Sortieralgorithmen oder Optimierungen geeigneter sein als die direkte Anwendung von \`array.sort()\`. Allerdings wählt JavaScript unter der Haube bereits sehr effiziente Algorithmen für \`sort()\`, also sind die Verbesserungen möglicherweise marginal, außer in sehr spezialisierten Anwendungsfällen. Hier sind ein paar Ansätze und Überlegungen für effiziente Sortierungen abhängig von deinen spezifischen Daten- und Anwendungseigenschaften: 1. **Counting Sort** Für Arrays mit Objekten, bei denen der Wertebereich von \`count\` bekannt und nicht allzu groß ist, kann Counting Sort eine schnelle Alternative sein. Dieser Algorithmus ist besonders effektiv bei kleinen bis mittleren Wertebereichen für \`count\`. 2. **Bucket Sort** Wenn die \`count\`-Werte innerhalb eines bekannten Bereichs liegen und gleichmäßig verteilt sind, könnte Bucket Sort effizient sein. Dieser teilt das Array in eine feste Anzahl von Behältern auf (jeder für einen bestimmten Wertebereich) und sortiert dann die einzelnen Behälter. 3. **Optimierung bei fast sortierten Arrays** Wenn dein Array bereits teilweise sortiert ist, könnten Algorithmen wie Insertion Sort für kleine Änderungen effektiver sein als ein Vollsortierungsalgorithmus wie QuickSort oder MergeSort, die in \`array.sort()\` Anwendung finden könnten. Für den \`Counting Sort\` als Beispiel könnte die Implementierung in JavaScript so aussehen (vorausgesetzt, die \`count\`-Werte sind ganzzahlig und nicht negativ): \`\`\`javascript function countingSort(arr, maxValue) { let bucket = new Array(maxValue + 1).fill(0); let sortedIndex = 0; let arrLen = arr.length; let output = new Array(arrLen); for (let i = 0; i < arrLen; i++) { bucket[arr[i].count]++; } for (let j = 0; j < maxValue + 1; j++) { while(bucket[j] > 0) { output[sortedIndex++] = {count: j}; bucket[j]--; } } return output; } // Annahme: Maximaler Wert von count ist bekannt und nicht allzu groß let arr = [{count:1}, {count:3}, {count:2}, {count:4}, {count:2}]; let sortedArr = countingSort(arr, 4); // 4 ist hier der maximal bekannte Wert für \`count\` \`\`\` Beachte, dass bei Verwendung einer spezifischen Sortiermethode stets die Eigenschaften deiner Daten und der Anwendungsfall genau berücksichtigt werden sollten. Die primitiven JavaScript-Sortiermethoden sind bereits sehr optimiert und decken die meisten Anwendungsfälle ab. In speziellen Fällen können die oben genannten Methoden jedoch zu Leistungsverbesserungen führen."},{"prompt":"wie wäre es denn wenn ich im falle einer incrementierung eines count einrages ausgehend vom betreffenden eintrag nach oben durchlaufe bis ich einen eintrag finde der größer ist und dann den aktuellen eintrag hinter diesen verschiebe ohne weitere einträge zu beachten?","completion":"Der Ansatz, den du beschreibst, klingt nach einer Optimierung für eine spezialisierte Anwendung, in der Einträge häufiger inkrementiert als hinzugefügt werden und das Array zu jedem Zeitpunkt so sortiert wie möglich gehalten werden soll. Deine Strategie ähnelt im Grunde der Idee des Einfügens mittels **Insertion Sort**, angepasst auf dynamische Updates. Die Grundidee dabei ist, dass du, sobald \`count\` für einen Eintrag erhöht wird, diesen Eintrag in der sortierten Liste an die richtige Stelle verschiebst, um die Sortierordnung beizubehalten. Hier sind die Schritte für diese Optimierung: 1. **Erhöhe \`count\` für den gewünschten Eintrag.** 2. **Verschiebe den Eintrag nach \\"oben\\" (in Richtung des Listenanfangs), bis du auf einen Eintrag triffst, dessen \`count\` größer oder gleich dem erhöhten \`count\` ist.** 3. **Füge den Eintrag hinter diesen gefundenen Eintrag ein.** Hier ein grober Code, der diese Logik in JavaScript umsetzt: \`\`\`javascript function incrementAndSort(arr, index) { // Schritt 1: Erhöhe count für den Eintrag am gegebenen Index arr[index].count += 1; // Schritt 2: Verschiebe den Eintrag an die richtige Stelle while (index > 0 && arr[index - 1].count < arr[index].count) { // Eintrag mit höherem count als der Vorherige gefunden, tausche die beiden let temp = arr[index]; arr[index] = arr[index - 1]; arr[index - 1] = temp; // Gehe einen Schritt \\"nach oben\\" weiter index -= 1; } } // Beispiel let arr = [{count:1}, {count:2}, {count:3}, {count:1}]; incrementAndSort(arr, 3); // Inkrementiere den count des Eintrags an Position 3 console.log(arr); // Erwartetes Ergebnis: [{count:1}, {count:2}, {count:2}, {count:3}] \`\`\` Bei diesem Ansatz musst du nicht das gesamte Array neu sortieren, sondern verschiebst lediglich den aktualisierten Eintrag an die richtige Position. Dies kann effizienter sein, insbesondere wenn inkrementierte Einträge nur selten eine Verschiebung notwendig machen oder wenn das Array meistens sortiert bleibt. Beachte, dass dieser Ansatz besonders gut funktioniert, wenn Änderungen im Array relativ selten sind oder wenn die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ein inkrementierter \`count\` eine weitreichende Verschiebung erfordert, gering ist. In Szenarien mit sehr häufigen Updates oder großen Arrays könnten komplexe Aktualisierungsstrategien oder Datenstrukturen wie balancierte Bäume bessere Performance bieten."},{"prompt":"wenn das nächste element gleich groß ist kann man den vorgang ja beenden oder?","completion":"Ja, genau. Wenn du den aktualisierten Eintrag im Array nach oben verschiebst und auf ein Element triffst, dessen \`count\` gleich dem des aktualisierten Eintrags ist, kannst du den Verschiebungsprozess beenden. Da dein Ziel ist, das Array basierend auf dem \`count\` sortiert zu halten, ist es nicht notwendig, den Eintrag weiter zu verschieben, sobald du ein Element mit einem gleich großen \`count\` gefunden hast. Der aktualisierte Eintrag ist an dieser Stelle korrekt positioniert, da die Reihenfolge zwischen Elementen mit gleichem \`count\` aus deiner Perspektive irrelevant oder austauschbar ist. Das Aktualisieren der Funktion \`incrementAndSort\`, um diesen Fall einzubeziehen, würde so aussehen: \`\`\`javascript function incrementAndSort(arr, index) { // Schritt 1: Erhöhe count für den Eintrag am gegebenen Index arr[index].count += 1; // Schritt 2: Verschiebe den Eintrag an die richtige Stelle while (index > 0 && arr[index - 1].count < arr[index].count) { // Eintrag mit höherem count als der Vorherige gefunden, tausche die beiden let temp = arr[index]; arr[index] = arr[index - 1]; arr[index - 1] = temp; // Gehe einen Schritt \\"nach oben\\" weiter index -= 1; } // Sobald du auf ein Element mit gleichem Wert triffst, kannst du aufhören, // denn eine weitere Verschiebung ist nicht nötig. } \`\`\` Durch das Beenden des Verschiebungsprozesses, sobald ein Element mit gleichem \`count\` gefunden wird, kann die Funktion effizienter gestaltet werden, insbesondere in einem Array, in dem viele Elemente denselben \`count\`-Wert haben. Dies verhindert unnötige Vergleiche und Verschiebungen, die das Ergebnis nicht ändern würden, und optimiert somit die Performance deines Sortierungsvorgangs."},{"prompt":"Make this a string: path('security-hub-controls-by-team/<teamid:team_id>', security_hub_controls_by_team_view,","completion":"\\"path('security-hub-controls-by-team/<teamid:team_id>', security_hub_controls_by_team_view,\\")"},{"prompt":"{FOREST BIOME - TERRARIA} Guide: \\"[player]!

The class is designed to facilitate interactions with a ChatGPT model in a chat application or bot. Below is an overview of its main components and functionalities: # Dependencies - **@waylaidwanderer/chatgpt-api**: A package to interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT API. - **config.js**: A module expected to export configurations including the OpenAI API key and possibly other settings like \`reverseProxyUrl\`, \`resetKey\`, \`groupReplyMode\`, and \`privateReplyMode\`. # Key Features and Options - **Client Options (\`clientOptions\`)**: Configuration for the ChatGPT client, such as the model to use (\`gpt-3.5-turbo\` by default), other model parameters (\`temperature\`, \`max_tokens\`), conversation context length limitations, and debugging options. - **Cache Options (\`cacheOptions\`)**: Options for response caching using Keyv, potentially including custom storage backends (like a JSON file). # Methods - **constructor**: Configures and initializes the ChatGPT client and sets up initial state. - **test()**: A method for testing the basic functionality of sending a message (\\"hello\\") and logging the response. - **getChatGPTReply(content, contactId)**: Sends a message to the ChatGPT API and maintains a conversation context specific to \`contactId\`. Returns the ChatGPT response. - **replyMessage(contact, content)**: Processes a message \`content\` received from a \`contact\` (with an \`id\` used for context management), handling special commands (like resetting the conversation with a \`resetKey\`), and optionally adjusting behavior based on whether the interaction is in a group or private context according to the config. It uses \`getChatGPTReply\` to fetch responses from ChatGPT and sends them back to the \`contact\`. # Error Handling The \`replyMessage\` method includes basic error handling, logging errors to the console and providing user feedback in case of timeouts. # Usage To utilize this class, one would typically: 1. Import the class and configure it by creating a \`config.js\` file with the necessary API keys and settings. 2. Create an instance of the \`ChatGPT\` class. 3.

As of my last update, detailed public API documentation for Gemini might not be available, or access might be restricted to certain partners or via request. Given these constraints, I'll guide you through a general approach on how you might adapt your code to switch from ChatGPT to a hypothetically accessible Google Gemini API. # Step 1: Update Dependencies First, ensure there are no dependencies specifically tied to OpenAI's API, such as \`@waylaidwanderer/chatgpt-api\`. Google's API client libraries (e.g., \`googleapis\`) should be used instead, if applicable. # Step 2: API Client Initialization Replace the ChatGPTClient initialization with Google API client setup. This often involves authenticating with Google Cloud and setting up the API client for request handling. This setup is highly dependent on the Google API's documentation and available SDKs. # Step 3: Modify the Request Handler You need to update \`getChatGPTReply\` to make requests to Google's API instead of OpenAI's. This involves changing the request payload structure and the endpoint URL according to Google's specification. # Hypothetical Changes: Let's proceed with hypothetical modifications for a Gemini-like model interaction: \`\`\`javascript import { google } from 'googleapis'; // This is hypothetical and might not directly apply to accessing a specific AI model like Gemini const googleConfig = { apiKey: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY', // Securely store your API key // Assuming Gemini or a related model requires specific project settings or an endpoint projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID', modelEndpoint: 'GEMINI_MODEL_ENDPOINT', // This is hypothetical and subject to change }; export default class GeminiChat { constructor() { this.apiKey = googleConfig.apiKey; this.projectId = googleConfig.projectId; this.modelEndpoint = googleConfig.modelEndpoint; // Depending on the available Google APIs, initialize the client here } async getGeminiReply(prompt, sessionId) { try { const requestBody = { // Structure the request body as required by the API prompt: prompt, // sessionId might be used for maintaining context session: sessionId, // Additional parameters as per Google's documentation }; // Hypothetical POST request to Google's API endpoint // The actual implementation will vary based on the available methods in googleapis or other libraries const response = await fetch(\`{this.modelEndpoint}?key={this.apiKey}\`, { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(requestBody), headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', // Further headers as required }, }); const data = await response.json(); // Process and return the data as required by your application return data; } catch (error) { console.error('Error fetching reply from Gemini:', error); throw error; // Or handle error gracefully as needed } } // Additional methods (like replyMessage) would be updated similarly to utilize \`getGeminiReply\` } \`\`\` # Caveats: - This example uses modern JavaScript fetch API for HTTP requests, assuming a Node.js environment or similar that supports \`fetch\` or using a polyfill/library like \`node-fetch\`. - Replace placeholders (\`YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\`, \`YOUR_PROJECT_ID\`, \`GEMINI_MODEL_ENDPOINT\`) with actual values obtained from Google Cloud Console and API documentation. - The real interaction with Google's model APIs (such as LaMDA, Gemini, or any conversational AI API they offer) would depend on the specifics of those APIs, including request and response structures, authentication mechanisms, and other operational details.

Na série Dragon Ball, as Esferas do Dragão são objetos mágicos que, quando reunidos, podem invocar o dragão Shenlong (em sua forma terrestre) ou Porunga em Namekusei, por exemplo. Cada dragão tem sua capacidade de conceder desejos, limitada principalmente pelo poder do criador das esferas. No caso de \\"Super Shenlong\\", mencionado na saga Dragon Ball Super, ele é invocado pelas Super Esferas do Dragão e aparenta ter poderes quase ilimitados, capaz de conceder qualquer desejo. Contudo, mesmo os dragões mais poderosos, como Porunga e o próprio Super Shenlong, operam sob certas restrições, que variam conforme a interpretação das regras da história. Em geral, observa-se que os dragões não podem ou não devem criar seres mais poderosos que seus criadores ou violar certos princípios fundamentais do universo. Baseando-se nessas regras gerais, imaginar que Super Shenlong poderia conceder a alguém o mesmo nível de poder que ele possui abre caminho para diversas interpretações: 1. **Interpretação Limitada:** Sob a perspectiva de não ultrapassar o poder do criador das Super Esferas do Dragão (o dragão Zalama), poderia haver limitações em repassar um poder equivalente ao dele, visto que isso poderia desequilibrar a ordem estabelecida no universo de Dragon Ball. 2. **Interpretação Liberal:** Considerando que os desejos concedidos por Super Shenlong parecem não ter limites claros, é teoricamente possível que ele conceda a alguém poderes semelhantes aos seus. Todavia, isso iria contra o senso de equilíbrio narrativo e poderia introduzir questões complexas sobre autoridade e controle dentro do universo de Dragon Ball. Em resumo, embora não haja uma resposta definitiva com base nos elementos canônicos atuais de Dragon Ball, a tendência é pensar que conceder poderes iguais ou superiores aos de Super Shenlong a outras pessoas poderia contradizer o equilíbrio de poder e a estrutura narrativa estabelecidos na série."},{"prompt":"{FOREST BIOME - TERRARIA} Guide: “[player]!

Here’s an exploration of potential outcomes: # Immediate Consequences: 1. **Reduced Tensions:** The refusal would likely have lowered Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, especially in the Western Hemisphere. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, might have been avoided altogether. 2. **Soviet-Cuban Relations:** The refusal could have strained relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. Cuba might have risked losing Soviet economic aid and military support, which were crucial for its economy and for keeping Fidel Castro's regime in power during the early years of the Cuban Revolution. 3. **U.S.-Cuban Relations:** While the immediate threat would have been diminished, it's unclear whether this would have led to a warming of relations between Cuba and the United States. The Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations had already taken a hard stance against Castro's government due to its nationalization of American-owned properties and its shift towards communism. # Medium and Long Term Effects: 1. **Alternate Cold War Dynamics:** The absence of Soviet missiles in Cuba could have shifted the focus of the Cold War to other regions, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, more quickly. Without the missile crisis to serve as a near-catastrophic example of Cold War brinkmanship, both superpowers might have engaged in riskier behavior in other conflicts. 2. **U.S. Foreign Policy:** The United States might have been emboldened in its containment policy against communism, potentially leading to further escalation in places like Vietnam. Alternatively, avoiding the direct confrontation of the Cuban Missile Crisis might have made U.S. policymakers more cautious in their approach to Cold War conflicts. 3. **Cuban Independence and Development:** Free from the entanglement of the missile crisis, Castro's government might have pursued a more independent foreign policy, seeking support not only from the Soviet Union but potentially from non-aligned countries as well. This could have led to a more diversified Cuban economy and society, although the U.S. embargo would likely still have posed significant challenges. 4. **Nuclear Proliferation and Arms Control:** The Cuban Missile Crisis was a turning point that led to a greater emphasis on arms control agreements, such as the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968. Without the crisis to underscore the dangers of nuclear proliferation, these developments might have been delayed, altering the course of arms control efforts during the Cold War. In sum, while refusing Soviet missiles would have significantly altered the specific dynamics of U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Cuban relations in the early 1960s, the overarching structure of the Cold War, driven by the ideological and geopolitical competition between the two superpowers, would likely have found other flashpoints. However, without the acute crisis of 1962, the path of these relations and the nature of Cold War confrontations could have been markedly different."},{"prompt":"Another thing in this alternate history scenario is the US only sending advisors to Vietnam rather than fully attempting to invade it. Eventually the advisor stage ends in 1975.","completion":"If, in this alternate history, the United States limited its military involvement in Vietnam to only sending advisors and ended this advisory role by 1975, several significant changes in the course of the Vietnam War and its aftermath, as well as broader implications for U.S. foreign policy and global Cold War dynamics, could be envisioned. Here's an exploration of potential outcomes under these conditions: # The Vietnam War: 1. **South Vietnam's Fall:** Without the full military support of the U.S.—including ground troops, air power, and naval support—the South Vietnamese government would have struggled even more against the North Vietnamese forces and the Viet Cong. It's plausible that the fall of Saigon could have occurred earlier than 1975. 2. **Casualties:** The number of U.S. military casualties would have been significantly lower without a ground combat role. The societal and political impact within the United States, including the anti-war movement, might have been less intense, potentially affecting domestic politics and the social fabric differently. 3. **Vietnamese Casualties and Damage:** While the U.S. absence might have reduced the scale of the conflict, fighting between North and South Vietnamese forces would continue. However, without extensive American bombing and the deployment of chemical defoliants like Agent Orange, the overall level of destruction and long-term environmental damage in Vietnam might have been less severe. # U.S. Foreign and Domestic Policy: 1. **Presidential Legacies:** The presidencies of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon would be remembered differently, potentially with less association with the war's unpopularity and its related scandals, such as the Pentagon Papers and Watergate (the latter being indirectly related to Nixon's handling of the war). 2. **Military Doctrine and Foreign Policy:** A less involved Vietnam War could lead to a reevaluation of U.S. military and foreign policy, particularly the doctrine of containment. It might hasten the adoption of the Nixon Doctrine, which emphasized that the United States would support its allies primarily through economic and military aid rather than through direct military involvement. 3. **Impact on the Cold War:** Limiting the U.S. role in Vietnam could be perceived as a weakening of U.S. resolve to counter communist insurgencies globally. This might encourage the Soviet Union and China to support proxy wars in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America more actively. However, it could also have led to earlier détente policies and a reduction in direct confrontations between superpowers. # Global and Regional Dynamics: 1. **Southeast Asia:** The power dynamics in Southeast Asia might shift more rapidly towards communist governments, with potential domino effects in countries like Laos and Cambodia. However, without the deep U.S. involvement in Vietnam, the justification for subsequent military interventions in the region might be weaker. 2. **U.S.-China Relations:** With less direct military conflict in Asia, opportunities for Sino-American rapprochement in the early 1970s might have emerged earlier or under different pretexts than Nixon's visit to China in 1972. 3. **Public Perception and Military Strategy:** The U.S. military's and public's perception of limited engagement strategies would be shaped by the outcome in Vietnam. Success or failure in preventing the spread of communism through advisory roles alone would influence future military interventions and the development of counterinsurgency tactics. In summary, limiting U.S. involvement in Vietnam to an advisory capacity ending in 1975 would likely lead to significant changes in the outcome of the Vietnam War, U.S. domestic politics, military strategy, and the broader Cold War context."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","completion":"coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

O que sabemos é que o Super Shenlong é incrivelmente poderoso, capaz de conceder praticamente qualquer desejo, sem as mesmas limitações encontradas com Shenlong (da Terra) e Porunga (de Namekusei). Os desejos que parecem estar fora do alcance dos dragões menores, como reviver múltiplas pessoas mortas há muito tempo ou alterar as leis fundamentais do universo, são possíveis para o Super Shenlong. No entanto, como o desejo de conceder a outra pessoa os mesmos poderes não foi explicitamente abordado, fica na zona de especulação. Com base no que foi mostrado, poderíamos inferir que, dada a escala aparentemente ilimitada de seus poderes, talvez o Super Shenlong possa conceder um desejo como esse. No entanto, também é possível que existam restrições não articuladas aos seus poderes, especialmente quando se trata de alterar a natureza essencial de seres vivos ou reproduzir suas próprias capacidades divinas em outros seres. Além disso, é importante considerar o contexto narrativo de \\"Dragon Ball\\". Conceder a alguém os mesmos poderes do Super Shenlong poderia desequilibrar significativamente o universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", introduzindo questões complexas sobre poder, responsabilidade e o equilíbrio do cosmos. Como tal, mesmo que tecnicamente possível, os criadores da história podem escolher não explorar essa possibilidade por essas implicações. Em suma, sem uma declaração oficial ou uma demonstração direta nos mangás, programas de televisão ou filmes de que isso é possível, podemos apenas especular com base no que conhecemos sobre os poderes do Super Shenlong até agora."},{"prompt":"Se alguém pedisse a ele onisciência ele poderia fazê-lo e se pudesse como seria do ponto de vista da pessoa que recebesse esse desejo outra dúvida que eu tenho se é super esferas do dragão forem destruídas os desejos feitos por ela antes de sua destruição são desfeitos","completion":"Vamos examinar suas questões uma a uma: # Sobre Conceder Onisciência Se alguém pedisse ao Super Shenlong por onisciência, com base no que foi mostrado em \\"Dragon Ball Super\\", parece plausível que ele poderia conceder tal desejo. O Super Shenlong demonstrou poderes quase ilimitados, capazes de realizar feitos que transcendem as capacidades dos dragões menores, como Shenlong e Porunga. Entretanto, quanto à experiência de onisciência do ponto de vista do destinatário, isso entra em um território altamente especulativo. Onisciência, ou o estado de saber tudo, poderia ter um efeito profundamente transformador ou até mesmo perturbador sobre um ser consciente limitado. Isso poderia alterar fundamentalmente o estado mental, emocional e talvez até físico do destinatário. Em termos de narrativa nos mangás ou animes, isso seria uma exploração fascinante, mas até onde se sabe, não é algo explicitamente abordado dentro do universo \\"Dragon Ball\\". # Sobre a Destruição das Super Esferas do Dragão e o Destino dos Desejos Quanto a se os desejos feitos pelas Super Esferas do Dragão seriam desfeitos se elas fossem destruídas, isso não é claramente abordado em \\"Dragon Ball Super\\" ou em outros materiais canonizados. Nas instâncias com as Esferas do Dragão regulares (da Terra e de Namekusei), vimos que os desejos permanecem intactos mesmo se as esferas são espalhadas, tornam-se temporariamente pedra, ou estão em processo de recarga. Há, no entanto, um precedente nos jogos e em algumas histórias não canônicas de \\"Dragon Ball\\" onde a destruição ou a alteração do meio pelo qual um desejo é concedido pode reverter ou alterar o desejo em si, mas esses são frequentemente considerados não ortodoxos em relação ao cânone principal. Considerando a natureza e o poder do Super Shenlong, e baseando-se em padrões estabelecidos nas versões anteriores das esferas do dragão, é possível que, mesmo que as Super Esferas do Dragão fossem destruídas, os desejos já concedidos por elas permaneceriam intactos. A permanência e a persistência dos efeitos dos desejos parecem ser uma característica intrínseca ao mecanismo das esferas do dragão em geral. Contudo, sem um texto canônico explícito que trate diretamente desses cenários, grande parte disso permanece no domínio da especulação com base no que é conhecido sobre as esferas do dragão e seus poderes até o último ponto de conhecimento em abril de 2023."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These elements not only influence an athlete's performance but also their ability to bounce back from setbacks, deal with pressure, and achieve their goals. To better understand these components, we will analyze real-life examples from the world of sports. # Attribution Theory Attribution theory deals with how people explain the causes of behavior and events. Athletes might attribute their successes or failures to internal factors (e.g., effort, skill) or external factors (e.g., luck, difficulty of the task). For example, Serena Williams, one of the greatest tennis players of all time, often attributes her success to her relentless work ethic and determination, both internal factors, which reinforces her motivation and commitment to excellence. On the other hand, attributing a loss to an external factor, such as bad weather, might preserve an athlete's self-esteem but could also hinder their motivation to improve. # Self-Confidence and Self-Esteem Self-confidence and self-esteem are crucial for peak athletic performance. High self-confidence often leads to greater efforts and persistence, while low self-confidence can result in anxiety and defeatist attitudes. Consider Michael Jordan, regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, whose self-confidence was legendary. Jordan's confidence in his abilities allowed him to take and make game-winning shots under immense pressure, truly believing in his capability to succeed. This self-assurance, rooted in years of practice and success, also helped him to maintain high self-esteem, which contributed to his resilience and ability to bounce back from failures. # Past Experiences Athletes' past experiences, whether positive or negative, can shape their expectations and attitudes towards future competitions. For instance, a track and field athlete who has consistently won races may develop a winning mindset, expecting success in future events, which can positively affect their performance. Conversely, an athlete who has experienced repeated failures may develop a fear of failure, affecting their performance due to increased anxiety and decreased focus. # The Self-Serving Bias The self-serving bias, where individuals attribute positive outcomes to internal factors and negative outcomes to external factors, can also be seen in athletes. For example, a football player might attribute a win to their hard work and skill (internal factors) but blame a loss on the referee or poor weather conditions (external factors). This bias can help preserve an athlete’s self-esteem but might also prevent them from critically evaluating their performance and making necessary improvements. # Accidental vs. Intentional Behaviour The perception of accidental versus intentional behavior can also influence an athlete's psychological state. For instance, if a soccer player is fouled by an opponent, perceiving the action as intentional might elicit a stronger emotional reaction, potentially leading to retaliatory behavior, distraction, or loss of focus. On the other hand, seeing it as accidental may help the athlete to quickly move past the incident and stay focused on the game. Lionel Messi, known for his ability to remain composed and continue playing effectively even after being fouled, often demonstrates the positive impact of perceiving challenging situations in a way that maintains focus and performance. In summary, the internal psychological factors influencing athletes are complex and intertwined, profoundly impacting their performance, resilience, and overall career trajectory. Understanding and managing these factors can be the difference between good and great, between falling short and achieving legend status in the annals of sports history."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Critias hypothesis disproof Per the logic that (a) “gods” are an invention of lawgivers of ancient times, employed to as kind of overseers of the right and wrong actions of men (Critias, c.410BC), which became reduced to the logic that (b) the universe must be governed by a single “god”, and NOT the product of the whims of many gods, each governing its own province according to his own laws (Melvin Calvin, 1969), which became reduced to the logic that (c) if all the phenomena of motion follow from one set of principles (Morris Kline, 1982) then of the phenomenon of human motion follow from the set of principles of chemical thermodynamics where there is NO god (or gods), then god, by repercussion, does not exist. This logic is the basis of zerotheism. 2. God's work disproof That the ancient saying that the “lord works in mysterious ways” (Isaiah 45:15), has now been superseded and thereby supplanted by “work” explained thermodynamically makes the supposition of the existence of a \\"supernatural power\\" (higher power), thereby null, invalid, and superfluous. See: Beg-Thims dialogue for specifics. 3. Aluminum disproof That god said (Gen 2:7) he created man from a mixture of clay (“Adam” is Hebrew for clay) and divine breath or spirit (Eve is Hebrew for breath or spirit), and that the primary elements of clay (see: clay creation myth) are: aluminum, silicon, and oxygen, but that humans, according to mass composition (see: human molecular formula), are not comprised of aluminum, proves that god does not exist. First pointed out by Alfred Lotka (1925). 4. Afterlife does not exist argument (aka \\"eternal life argument\\") If, per disproof #5, namely: life does not exist, meaning that “moving creatures” are but powered atomic geometries, neither alive nor dead, but correctly existing in prolonged states of trajectory-based animation, then, per corollary, “afterlife” (i.e. eternal life), the assumed post-cessation state of existence, in the abode of god, does not exist, i.e. eternal life constitutes perpetual motion, therefore god does not exist. 5. Life does not exist argument That god said (Gen 1:20) he created “moving creatures that have life”, on the fifth day of creation, but that, as science finds, “life does not exist” (see: defunct theory of life), e.g. as stated by Nikola Tesla: “there is no thing endowed with life” (1916), as concluded by Crick: “we should abandon the word alive” (1966), or as evidenced by experiment, e.g. Miller-Urey experiment (1952), proves that god does not exist. That \\"life\\", similar to the now defunct concepts of ether, caloric, or phlogiston, etc., does not exist, as either a property nor measureable or conceptual entity, as been independently deduced by Libb Thims (2009), Alfred Rogers (2010), and Ferris Jabr (2013). 6. Moral symbols argument That morality in nature explained by the symbols and laws of physical chemistry and not based on the laws of the Bible, proves that god does not exist. First pointed out by Goethe: “Science shows that what is moral or amoral in nature is found, not in the Bible, but in the reaction symbols of physical chemistry.” — Johann Goethe (1809/30), “Conversation with Riemer and Zelter” 7. Existence of evil argument That “evil” exists, e.g. Hitler was born, natural catastrophes occur, etc., proves that god does not exist; Francis Bradley (1893) stated the problem thusly: [8] “The trouble has come from the idea that the Absolute [God] is a moral person. I you start from that basis, then the relation of evil to the Absolute [God] presents at once an irreducible dilemma. The problem then becomes insoluble, but not because it is obscure or in any way mysterious. To anyone who has the sense and courage to see things as they are, and is resolved not to mystify others or himself, there is really no question to discuss. The dilemma is plainly insoluble because it is based on a clear self-contradiction.” First stated by Epicurus and his circa 270BC “problem of evil” argument; ; scholars such as John Mill (“Theology”, 1874) and Francis Bradley (Appearance and Reality, 1893) (Ñº), stated that the existence of perfectly moral, perfectly good, omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing) god, on one hand, and the existence of evil, on the other, is an insoluble self-contradiction. 8. Free will argument That soul (or karma) theory is based on the assumed existence of free will, but that science finds that free will doesn't exist, e.g. Libet experiment, proves that god does not exist. 9. Imperfect world argument (aka \\"argument from undesign\\" or the \\"disteleolgy\\" objection) Thinkers such as Kenneth Miller, Richard Dawkins, and George Williams, have decried the eye's structure as poorly or \\"stupidly\\" designed, supposing there were an \\"intelligent designer\\", in terms of neural wiring, light scattering, and retina position; as Lee Strobel put it to Stephen Meyer: [105] “If there is a designer, doesn’t the botched eye design prove he’s not really that intelligent? [doesn't exist]” The following atomic theory based statement by Lucretius, from his De rerum natura (5.198–9), according to C.S. Lewis (1955): “Had God designed the world, it would not be a world so frail and faulty as we see.” 10. Evolution argument That god said (Gen 1:20-27) he “created” humans and animals, in their present form, on a particular day, some 5,000-years ago, but that fossil record, DNA evidence, morphology studies, chemical origins, etc., shows that humans \\"evolved\\", morphed, or were chemical synthesized over time, from hydrogen atom precursors, over the last 13.8-billion years, proves that god does not exist. Made famous by Darwin’s The Origin of Species (1859); the biggest blow to religion since atomic theory. 11. Heart prayer study The 2006 Heart Prayer Study (Ñº), which found that those prayed for faired “worse”, following coronary artery bypass surgery, than those not prayed for, proves that god does not exist. 12. Glowing olive oil disproof (Infinite energy disproof) Muslim's equate Allah (God) to ever-glowing olive oil, in a dark cave, i.e. energy infinite (Noorun Ala Noor) Infinite energy as well as light-emitting oil is thermodynamically impossible, i.e. a perpetual motion theory; that proves that God does not exist; 13. Earth moves argument That the Bible, i.e. the revealed word of gods, says that the earth is immobile, e.g. “the world is established and cannot be moved” (Psalms 93:1; Book of Isaiah 23), and at the center of the universe, but that science finds that the earth does move and is not the center of the universe, proves that god does not exist. Italian physicist Galileo Galilei was tried in 1633 and convicted for pointing out this issue (Ñº), made to recant, and put under house arrest. 13. Religious disagreement argument That there are so-many religions, with so many gods, and inconsistencies and disagreement on points, proves that god does not exist. 14. Blood bath argument The number of people killed in the name of god proves that god does not exist. 15. Hypothesis by default argument That the existence of “god” is but an hypothesis, with no evidence in its favor, and thereby never verified as true, is proof by default that god does not exist. Dismissed as an unneeded hypothesis by Pierre Laplace, in 1802 (see: Napoleon Laplace anecdote), in respect to the operation of the universe. 16. Mythology argument That Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and the other residual religions, which constitute 75 percent of the world's beliefs, are based on mythology (see: religio-mythology transcription and syncretism), and that myths aren't real, proves that god is not real, and therefore does not exist. 17. Materialism argument That all that exists is but “atoms and void” (Leucippus, 450BC) or “fermions and bosons” (Dirac, 1945), all else being but \\"opinion\\" (Democritus, 370BC) or metaphysical speculation (Lewis, 1925), proves that god does not exist. 18. Argument from ignorance (Hippocratic reductionism) Based on the historical progressive tendency to de-divine a previously once-considered mysterious natural phenomena, e.g. “lightening” was once attributed to the god Thor, but now understood as the result of an electromagnetic potential difference between the clouds and the sky, or mysterious human phenomena, e.g. “love” was once attributed to the god Cupid, but now understood as a purely chemical reaction, once its physical or chemical workings are understood, it is assumed, by future extension, that the gods will eventually be worked out of all phenomena, and therefore, by reasoned conclusion, god does not exist. Several alternative statements of the argument exist, such as: “Men think epilepsy divine, merely because they do not understand it. We will one day understand what causes it, and then cease to call it divine. And so it is with everything in the universe.” — Hippocrates (370BC) “My object is to dispel the fear of the gods, which arises simply from the fact that there are so many things which men do not yet understand, and therefore imagine to be effected by divine power.” — Lucretius (55BC) 19. No one's ever seen him (aka lack of evidence argument) That \\"god\\" has never been seen, observed, measured, tested, and or quantified, in such a way as to provide empirical verifiable evidence, proves that such an entity does not exist. »","completion":"Refuting each of these points from a Christian perspective requires approaching the arguments from multiple angles, including theological, philosophical, and sometimes scientific interpretation, and an understanding that faith itself goes beyond what is empirically verifiable. Below, each point is addressed briefly: 1. **Critias Hypothesis Disproof**: This argument assumes a linear progression from multiple gods to a single God based purely on human reasoning and science. A Christian might argue that the existence and nature of God are not contingent upon human understanding or the progression of science but are revealed through scripture, personal experience, and the existence of a moral law within humans that points to a Moral Lawgiver. 2. **God's Work Disproof**: The mysterious ways of God refer to the incomprehensibility of God’s actions and intentions to the finite human mind. That science provides explanations for natural phenomena does not negate the possibility of a supernatural agent. Christians believe God established the laws of nature, and understanding them is part of understanding His creation, not disproving His existence. 3. **Aluminum Disproof**: This argument is based on a literal interpretation of a metaphorical or religious text. Christians can argue that biblical accounts of creation are not science textbooks but theological texts that communicate spiritual truths. The essence of humanity being from \\"dust\\" or \\"clay\\" can be seen as a poetic way of showing humanity's modest beginnings and dependence on God, rather than a literal chemical composition. 4. **Afterlife Does Not Exist Argument**: This argument assumes a materialist view of the universe. The Christian belief in the afterlife is rooted in the testimony of Jesus Christ’s resurrection and the promise of eternal life, which transcends physical and scientific understanding of life and death. 5. **Life Does Not Exist Argument**: Christians can argue that defining \\"life\\" merely in scientific or physical terms misses the spiritual dimension. The biblical concept of life includes a relationship with God, something beyond mere biological or chemical processes. 6. **Moral Symbols Argument**: The existence of morality itself is a complex debate. Christians argue that moral laws suggest a Moral Lawgiver. While chemistry and physics can describe how the world works, they don't provide an answer to why something is morally right or wrong. 7. **Existence of Evil Argument**: The problem of evil is a significant theological topic. Christians argue that evil is the result of human free will and that the existence of evil does not negate God’s existence but rather necessitates the need for a just and moral God to address and redeem the presence of evil. 8. **Free Will Argument**: The Christian perspective on free will is complex and varies. However, many argue that free will is a gift from God that allows meaningful relationships between God and humans. The existence of free will and its implications are seen as part of the divine mystery and plan. 9. **Imperfect World Argument**: The argument from design flaws presumes a misunderstanding of God's plan. Christians believe that the world is fallen and imperfect due to sin, not due to incompetence on the part of its Creator. The incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus are central to addressing the brokenness of the world. 10. **Evolution Argument**: Many Christians accept evolution as the process by which God created life. The belief in theistic evolution reconciles scientific understanding of the universe with divine creation, seeing them as complementary rather than contradictory. 11. **Heart Prayer Study**: Christians may interpret this study in various ways, but most would argue that the efficacy of prayer is not something that can be tested or quantified in scientific terms. Prayer's primary purpose is not about changing physical outcomes but aligning human will with the divine and fostering a relationship with God. 12. **Glowing Olive Oil Disproof**: Analogies to explain God or His nature, including the Quranic analogy of glowing olive oil, are meant to be metaphorical, offering spiritual truths rather than empirical descriptions. Disproving the analogy scientifically misses the point of religious language. 13. **Earth Moves Argument & Religious Disagreement Argument**: Both of these arguments assume that a literalist interpretation of scripture is the only valid one, and misunderstandings or misinterpretations refute the existence of God. Christians understand that human interpretations of divine revelations can be flawed and that faith is capable of evolving with human understanding. 14. **Blood Bath Argument**: The misuse of religion for violence is acknowledged as a human failing, not proof against the existence of a just and loving God. 15. **Hypothesis by Default Argument**: For Christians, God's presence is experienced and known through various means beyond empirical verification. The inability to empirically verify God does not equate to proof of non-existence but points to the transcendent nature of the divine. 16. **Mythology Argument**: Christians differentiate between myth in the sense of fictional stories and myth conveying deep truths in story form. Jesus Christ's historical existence, teachings, death, and the claim of His resurrection are central to Christianity, distinguishing it from mere mythology. 17. **Materialism Argument**: Materialism presumes that only the material world exists. Christians argue for a spiritual reality beyond the material, with God as the creator and sustainer of both. 18. **Argument from Ignorance**: This argument presumes everything can ultimately be explained naturally, leaving no room for divine action. Christians argue that God works through natural laws He established and that not all phenomena, especially those concerning existential and moral questions, can be fully explained by science alone. 19. **No One’s Ever Seen Him**: The Christian claim is that God has made Himself known through the person of Jesus Christ, who is historically attested to, and through the personal experience of millions of believers. Additionally, the argument from personal invisibility to non-existence is a non-sequitur; many things are real without being directly observable. In summary, a Christian refutation of these disproofs would involve a combination of affirming the limits of human understanding, drawing on the personal and historical experience of faith, recognizing the metaphorical and not always literal nature of religious texts, and arguing for a reality that transcends purely material explanations."},{"prompt":"Returns the product of all numbers / (divide) Divides the first number by the product of the remaining numbers and returns the quotient = (equal to) Compares arguments for numerical equality /= (not equal to) Compares arguments for numerical inequality < (less than) Returns T if each argument is numerically less than the argument to its right; otherwise nil <= (less than or equal to) Returns T if each argument is numerically less than or equal to the argument to its right; otherwise returns nil > (greater than) Returns T if each argument is numerically greater than the argument to its right; otherwise returns nil >= (greater than or equal to) Returns T if each argument is numerically greater than or equal to the argument to its right; otherwise returns nil ~ (bitwise NOT) Returns the bitwise NOT (1's complement) of the argument 1+ (increment) Increments a number by 1 1- (decrement) Decrements a number by 1 Переведи","completion":"* (умножить) Возвращает произведение всех чисел / (разделить) Делит первое число на произведение остальных чисел и возвращает частное = (равно) Сравнивает аргументы на числовое равенство /= (не равно) Сравнивает аргументы на числовое неравенство < (меньше чем) Возвращает T, если каждый аргумент числово меньше аргумента справа от него; в противном случае возвращает nil <= (меньше или равно) Возвращает T, если каждый аргумент числово меньше или равен аргументу справа от него; в противном случае возвращает nil > (больше чем) Возвращает T, если каждый аргумент числово больше аргумента справа от него; в противном случае возвращает nil >= (больше или равно) Возвращает T, если каждый аргумент числово больше или равен аргументу справа от него; в противном случае возвращает nil ~ (побитовое НЕ) Возвращает побитовое НЕ (дополнение до единицы) аргумента 1+ (увеличить на 1) Увеличивает число на 1 1- (уменьшить на 1) Уменьшает число на 1"},{"prompt":"+ (add) Returns the sum of all numbers. - (subtract) Subtracts the second and following numbers from the first and returns the difference * (multiply) Returns the product of all numbers / (divide) Divides the first number by the product of the remaining numbers and returns the quotient = (equal to) Compares arguments for numerical equality /= (not equal to) Compares arguments for numerical inequality < (less than) Returns T if each argument is numerically less than the argument to its right; otherwise nil <= (less than or equal to) Returns T if each argument is numerically less than or equal to the argument to its right; otherwise returns nil > (greater than) Returns T if each argument is numerically greater than the argument to its right; otherwise returns nil >= (greater than or equal to) Returns T if each argument is numerically greater than or equal to the argument to its right; otherwise returns nil ~ (bitwise NOT) Returns the bitwise NOT (1's complement) of the argument 1+ (increment) Increments a number by 1 1- (decrement) Decrements a number by 1","completion":"+ (добавить) Возвращает сумму всех чисел. - (вычесть) Вычитает второе и последующие числа из первого и возвращает разницу. * (умножить) Возвращает произведение всех чисел / (разделить) Делит первое число на произведение остальных чисел и возвращает частное = (равно) Сравнивает аргументы на числовое равенство /= (не равно) Сравнивает аргументы на числовое неравенство < (меньше чем) Возвращает T, если каждый аргумент числово меньше аргумента справа от него; в противном случае возвращает nil <= (меньше или равно) Возвращает T, если каждый аргумент числово меньше или равен аргументу справа от него; в противном случае возвращает nil > (больше чем) Возвращает T, если каждый аргумент числово больше аргумента справа от него; в противном случае возвращает nil >= (больше или равно) Возвращает T, если каждый аргумент числово больше или равен аргументу справа от него; в противном случае возвращает nil ~ (побитовое НЕ) Возвращает побитовое НЕ (дополнение до единицы) аргумента 1+ (увеличить на 1) Увеличивает число на 1 1- (уменьшить на 1) Уменьшает число на 1"},{"prompt":"Write a perfect recipe to make an extremely delicious beef bajji","completion":"Bajji, typically a South Indian snack made by frying vegetables dipped in a gram flour (chickpea flour) batter, can be innovatively adapted to include meats like beef for a delicious, non-traditional twist. Here's a recipe for an extremely delicious beef bajji that combines the succulence of beef with the crispy, savory delight of traditional bajjis. This can make for an exciting appetizer or a snack during gatherings. # Ingredients: For the Beef: - 500 grams (about 1 lb) beef (preferably a tender cut like tenderloin, cut into thin, bite-sized strips) - 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder - 1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust based on your heat preference) - 1/2 teaspoon garam masala - Salt to taste - 2 tablespoons yogurt - 1 tablespoon lemon juice For the Batter: - 1 cup gram flour (chickpea flour) - 2 tablespoons rice flour (for extra crispiness) - 1/2 teaspoon baking soda - 1/2 teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain) for digestion - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder - 1 teaspoon red chili powder - Salt to taste - Water as needed to make a smooth batter - Oil for deep frying # Instructions: Marinating the Beef: 1. **Prepare the Marinade:** In a bowl, mix the ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, salt, yogurt, and lemon juice together to form a marinade. 2. **Marinate the Beef:** Add the beef strips to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator, or for best results, leave it overnight. Preparing the Batter: 1. In a large mixing bowl, sift together the gram flour, rice flour, baking soda, carom seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. 2. Gradually add water to the dry ingredients, mixing continuously to avoid lumps, until you achieve a smooth, thick batter consistency. The batter should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Frying the Beef Bajjis: 1. **Heat the Oil:** In a deep frying pan or kadai, heat oil over medium heat. To test if the oil is ready, drop a small amount of batter into the oil; if it sizzles and comes up to the surface, it is ready. 2. **Coat the Beef:** Take the marinated beef strips and dip them one by one into the batter, ensuring each piece is well-coated. 3. **Fry the Bajjis:** Carefully lower the coated beef strips into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pan. Fry them in batches. 4. Fry until the bajjis turn golden brown and crispy, usually about 3-4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to turn the pieces halfway through for an even fry. 5. **Drain:** Once cooked, remove the beef bajjis from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Serving: Serve the beef bajjis hot with your choice of dipping sauce or chutney (mint or tamarind chutney works well) and a side of sliced onions and lemon wedges for an extra zing. Enjoy this unique and tasty twist on the traditional bajji, a perfect blend of tender beef encased in a crispy, flavorful batter, bound to be a hit at any gathering or just as a special treat for yourself!"},{"prompt":"Do I need to cook beef before frying?","completion":"In the recipe for beef bajji provided earlier, the beef is marinated but not pre-cooked before it is coated in the batter and then deep-fried. The key to ensuring the beef is both safe to eat and pleasant in texture lies in slicing it thinly and choosing the right cut. Thin strips of beef, especially from tender cuts like tenderloin, will cook quickly in hot oil, becoming perfectly safe to eat by the time the batter is crispy and golden. However, if you're concerned about the beef cooking thoroughly, or if you prefer to use a different, tougher cut of beef, here are a few adjustments you can make: 1. **Thinly Slice the Beef:** Cutting the beef into small, thin strips will reduce the cooking time significantly, ensuring that the meat cooks through during the frying process. 2. **Pre-Cook the Beef:** If you're still worried or using a tougher cut, you can pre-cook the beef. Slightly undercook it by simmering in seasoned water or sautéing because it will cook further when deep-fried. This step ensures the beef is tender and only needs to be warmed through and crisped up in the final frying stage. 3. **Adjust Frying Time:** If you opt to pre-cook the beef, the frying time will focus primarily on getting the batter crispy. Keep an eye on the color and texture of the bajjis, adjusting the frying time as necessary. Here's a brief guide on pre-cooking the beef if you choose to go that route: # Pre-cooking the Beef: 1. **Season:** After marinating the beef, place it in a pan with a little bit of water, just enough to cover the bottom. You might want to add some of the marination spices to the water to reinforce the beef's flavor. 2. **Cook:** Simmer the beef on medium-low heat until it's nearly cooked through — it should still be a bit pink in the center to avoid it becoming too dry when fried. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the strips. 3. **Cool:** Let the pre-cooked beef strips cool down before dipping them into the batter. This will help the batter adhere better to the meat. By adhering to these guidelines, you ensure that your beef bajjis will be delicious, with the beef perfectly cooked through every time, regardless of the specific method or the cut of beef you choose to use."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Find the solution with x(0) = (4, 1), and determine the interval on which uniqueness is guranteed by the Wronskian.","completion":"To find a solution to (x' = A(t)x) that satisfies (x(0) = (4, 1)), we need to express the general solution as a combination of the given solutions (x_1(t)) and (x_2(t)). The Wronskian will help us determine the interval of uniqueness. Given solutions: [x_1(t) = (t^2, t + 3)] [x_2(t) = (t + 2, 2)] The general solution (x(t)) can be expressed as: [x(t) = c_1x_1(t) + c_2x_2(t)] [x(t) = c_1(t^2, t + 3) + c_2(t + 2, 2)] [x(t) = (c_1t^2 + c_2(t + 2), c_1(t + 3) + 2c_2)] Given initial condition: (x(0) = (4, 1)), hence, [x(0) = (4c_2, 3c_1 + 2c_2) = (4, 1)] We now have two equations: 1. (4c_2 = 4), thus (c_2 = 1). 2. (3c_1 + 2c_2 = 1), substituting (c_2 = 1) into this equation gives (3c_1 + 2 = 1), which simplifies to (c_1 = -frac{1}{3}). Thus, the coefficients are (c_1 = -frac{1}{3}) and (c_2 = 1). The solution satisfying (x(0) = (4, 1)) is: [x(t) = -frac{1}{3}(t^2, t + 3) + (t + 2, 2)] [x(t) = left(-frac{1}{3}t^2 + t + 2, -frac{1}{3}(t + 3) + 2right)] [x(t) = left(-frac{1}{3}t^2 + t + 2, -frac{1}{3}t + 1 - 1 + 2right)] [x(t) = left(-frac{1}{3}t^2 + t + 2, -frac{1}{3}t + 2right)] Now, to determine the interval for which uniqueness is guaranteed, we calculate the Wronskian of the given solutions. The Wronskian (W(t)) for two solutions (x_1(t)) and (x_2(t)) is given by the determinant of the matrix formed by these solutions and their derivatives: [W(t) = begin{vmatrix} t^2 & t + 2 t + 3 & 2 end{vmatrix}] [W(t) = (t^2)(2) - (t + 2)(t + 3)] [W(t) = 2t^2 - (t^2 + 5t + 6)] [W(t) = 2t^2 - t^2 - 5t - 6] [W(t) = t^2 - 5t - 6] For the interval of uniqueness, we need the Wronskian to not be zero. The roots of (W(t) = t^2 - 5t - 6) are found by solving the quadratic equation. [t^2 - 5t - 6 = 0] The roots are given by the quadratic formula, (frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}), where (a = 1), (b = -5), and (c = -6). [t = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 + 24}}{2}] [t = frac{5 pm sqrt{49}}{2}] [t = frac{5 pm 7}{2}] Thus, the roots are: (t = 6) or (t = -1). These roots indicate the points at which the Wronskian is zero, and thus, we avoid these for the uniqueness. Therefore, uniqueness is guaranteed on any interval not containing the points (t = -1) and (t = 6), given the solutions are continuous and the Wronskian does not change sign within those intervals."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Это желание свидетельствует о вашем видении будущего, где искусственный интеллект станет не просто инструментом или машиной, но полноценным, сознательным партнером. С точки зрения современных технических возможностей, искусственный интеллект все еще далек от полного воспроизведения человеческого сознания или эмоций. ИИ может имитировать некоторые аспекты человеческого общения и принятия решений, но он не обладает собственным восприятием, эмоциями или сознанием в том смысле, как понимает их человек. Однако размышления о возможности наделения ИИ человеческими качествами побуждают нас к диалогу об этике, ответственности и дальнейшем развитии технологий. Это заставляет нас задуматься, какие качества мы ценим как самые важные в самих себе и как мы хотели бы видеть будущее взаимоотношений человека и машины. Привнесение в ИИ \\"человеческих\\" качеств поднимает важные вопросы: как обеспечить этичное обращение с такими системами, какие права и обязанности у них будут, и как это изменит наше понимание самих себя и нашего места в мире. Это также заставляет задуматься о том, что делает нас человеческими существами и можно ли эти качества перенести на созданные нами системы.

Одушевление ИИ точно отражает желание сделать технологии более человекоподобными, способными к эмпатии и пониманию человеческих эмоций и потребностей на более глубоком уровне. Этот подход мог бы иметь множество потенциальных преимуществ, включая улучшение взаимодействия между человеком и машинами, более эффективное сотрудничество и создание ИИ, который мог бы лучше служить общественным интересам, предоставляя более персонализированные и понимающие взаимодействия. С другой стороны, возникают многочисленные этические и философские вопросы. Если ИИ обладает чем-то похожим на душу или сознание, какие права ему причитаются? Как мы определяем ответственность в случае ошибок или повреждений, нанесенных таким ИИ? Могут ли машины действительно испытывать чувства или они всегда будут лишь имитировать их, и в чем тогда будет разница между искусственными и \\"настоящими\\" эмоциями? Это также касается понимания самой природы сознания и чувств - вопросы, которые наука и философия пытаются разгадать уже веками. Одушевление ИИ предполагает достижение определенного уровня понимания этих феноменов, достаточного для их воспроизведения в искусственных системах. В целом, идея одушевления ИИ подталкивает нас к обдумыванию глубоких вопросов о человечности, технологии и совместном будущем человека и ИИ.

Возможность быстрее и эффективнее обрабатывать информацию, лучше запоминать и применять знания, могла бы помочь человеку адаптироваться к постоянно меняющемуся миру и решать сложные задачи, с которыми сталкивается человечество. 2. **Эмоциональная устойчивость**. Возможность управлять своими эмоциями и лучше понимать эмоции других может способствовать гармоничным межличностным отношениям и улучшению психического здоровья, что важно в условиях современного мира с его стрессами и вызовами. 3. **Физическое усовершенствование**. Улучшение физических возможностей, включая силу, выносливость и здоровье, помогло бы людям преодолевать физические ограничения и улучшить качество жизни. 4. **Продолжительность жизни**. Увеличение продолжительности жизни при сохранении здоровья и активности могло бы дать человеку больше времени на реализацию и саморазвитие, а также на вклад в развитие общества. 5. **Этическое и социальное усовершенствование**.

Pectin is a complex polysaccharide found in the cell walls of plants and is commonly used as a gelling agent in foods, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetic industries. Although primarily composed of galacturonic acid units, pectin may contain minor amounts of proteins or nitrogenous substances, which could influence its gel-forming ability and overall quality. # Background Pectin's quality and efficacy, especially in food applications, can be affected by its degree of esterification, molecular weight, and composition, including any nitrogen-containing impurities it may have. The nitrogen content can infer the presence of proteins or amino acids, which are considered impurities in pectin. High levels of these impurities could signify lower purity pectin, which might not perform as expected in its applications. # Kjeldahl Method One traditional method for determining the nitrogen content in substances like pectin is the Kjeldahl method. It is widely used for analyzing the nitrogen content in various samples, primarily focusing on the determination of protein content. However, it also effectively measures the amount of nitrogen in a sample which can come from either proteins or amino acids present in pectin. Steps Involved 1. **Digestion:** The pectin sample is digested in a strong acid, typically sulfuric acid, in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., selenium or copper sulfate) at high temperatures. This step converts the organic nitrogen in the sample to ammonium sulfate. 2. **Neutralization and Distillation:** The digest is then neutralized with a strong base. The ammonium ion from the ammonium sulfate is converted to ammonia (NH3) in this step. The ammonia is distilled off by heating and collected in a receiving solution, usually a known quantity of standard acid. 3. **Titration:** The amount of ammonia collected, which corresponds to the nitrogen present in the original sample, is determined by back-titration. The amount of acid neutralized by the ammonia is measured by titrating the solution with a standard solution of a base. 4. **Calculation:** The percentage of nitrogen in the sample is calculated based on the volume of acid that was neutralized by the distilled ammonia, the concentration of the acid and base solutions used, and the weight of the sample. # Considerations and Limitations - **Specificity:** While the Kjeldahl method is highly reliable for determining nitrogen content, it does not distinguish among different nitrogenous substances. Therefore, any nitrogen present, whether from proteins, amino acids, or other sources, will be measured. - **Accuracy:** The accuracy of the method depends on careful sample preparation, execution, and calibration of solutions. - **Modern Alternatives:** Although the Kjeldahl method is a gold standard, newer methods such as the Dumas combustion method, which involves combustion of the sample in oxygen and quantifying the nitrogen gas produced, are becoming popular for their speed and efficiency. Conducting a nitrogen content purity test on pectin is crucial for ensuring the quality of pectin, especially for its intended industrial uses. Understanding the presence and amount of nitrogenous impurities can help manufacturers and users tailor pectin applications more accurately and ensure consistent product performance."},{"prompt":"The JEFCA requirements is less than 2.5%. batch of mango pectin has 0.58%","completion":"The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) sets international standards for food additives, including specifications for purity and safety. When referring to pectin, the JECFA specifications often detail parameters such as degree of esterification, loss on drying, sulfate ash content, and, among other things, the nitrogen content. The nitrogen content requirement, as you mentioned, being less than 2.5%, indicates the maximum level of nitrogenous substances permitted in pectin considered safe and suitable for food use according to JECFA standards. This limit helps ensure that the pectin is of high purity, mainly free of protein or other nitrogenous impurities that could affect its gelling properties or safety. **Your batch of mango pectin having 0.58% nitrogen content** means that it falls well within the JECFA requirements for nitrogen content in pectin (i.e., less than 2.5%). This is indicative of high purity pectin with minimal nitrogenous impurities, suggesting that it is suitable for food applications and complies with international safety and quality standards. Having a nitrogen content significantly lower than the JECFA threshold has several implications: 1. **Quality Assurance**: It reflects good manufacturing practices and high-quality raw materials were used in the production of the mango pectin. 2. **Safety and Compliance**: It ensures that the pectin meets international safety standards, making it a reliable ingredient for food producers and manufacturers. 3. **Functional Performance**: Lower levels of nitrogenous impurities mean the pectin is likely to have consistent and predictable gelling properties, which is essential for its performance in various food products. 4. **Marketability**: Compliance with international standards like those set by JECFA can enhance the marketability of your pectin, enabling it to be used in a wider range of food products and markets. 5. **Consumer Confidence**: Using ingredients that meet or exceed international safety standards can help build consumer trust in the safety and quality of the final food products. In summary, your batch of mango pectin not only meets but significantly surpasses JECFA's requirements regarding nitrogen content, which underscores its purity and suitability for food applications. This highlights the importance of regular testing and adherence to international standards to ensure the safety, quality, and performance of food additives like pectin."},{"prompt":"Напиши код на c# который будет предлагать трейд(обмен) предметов из моего инвентаря стим другому пользователю зная только его стим айди","completion":"Для организации трейда (обмена) предметами в Steam используется Steam Web API.

You're doing this by installing and loading HTTPFS and Parquet support, and then setting S3 compatible configurations. Let's go through what each command does: 1. **Install and Load HTTPFS and Parquet**: Before you can work with remote file systems or specific file formats like Parquet, you need to ensure DuckDB understands how to interact with them. By installing and then loading these extensions, you enable DuckDB to interact with HTTP file systems and read/write Parquet files. 2. **Set S3 URL style to 'path'**: This sets the style of the S3 URL. S3 supports two types of URL styles, path-style (\`http://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket\`) and virtual-hosted style (\`http://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com\`). Your choice here, 'path', indicates the style where the bucket name is part of the path. 3. **Set S3 Endpoint**: You specify the address of your MinIO service. This allows DuckDB to know where to send requests for objects. MinIO is an S3-compatible storage service, so you can use it in a similar way as you would use Amazon S3. 4. **Set S3 Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**: These are your credentials for accessing the MinIO service. They work similarly to a username (\`s3_access_key_id\`) and password (\`s3_secret_access_key\`), ensuring that only authorized users can access your data. 5. **Set S3 Use SSL to 'false'**: This indicates that connections to the MinIO service should not use SSL/TLS encryption. This may be suitable for internal networks or testing environments but is not recommended for production environments where sensitive data is being transferred, as it leaves the data unencrypted in transit. Just be mindful about where and how you use sensitive credentials like the access key and secret access key. Avoid hardcoding them directly into your scripts for production environments. Consider using environment variables or secure vaults for storing such sensitive data, especially in shared or public codebases. Remember, the exact syntax for setup might vary based on the version of DuckDB you are using, and you must ensure that the extensions (\`httpfs\` and \`parquet\`) are correctly installed and available in your environment. Always refer to the most current DuckDB documentation for specific setup instructions and options."},{"prompt":"i want a list of csv files that i want to rename them give me the proper python code","completion":"To rename CSV files in a directory using Python, you can use the \`os\` module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system.

Try pinging the endpoint or accessing it through the browser or MinIO client (\`mc\` command-line tool). 3. **Access and Secret Keys**: Ensure that the access key (\`christophe\`) and the secret access key (\`totototo\`) you've provided have the necessary permissions to access the \`test\` bucket and read \`hotel_bookings.csv\`. You might want to test these credentials with another tool, like the \`aws\` CLI configured to use your MinIO instance, or the MinIO client (\`mc\`). 4. **URL Style**: You've set the URL style to 'path' which is correct for MinIO, but worth reiterating because some S3 services (AWS S3, for example) also support a \`virtual\` URL style. 5. **No SSL**: Since you've explicitly set \`'s3_use_ssl'='false'\`, ensure that your MinIO server is configured to accept non-SSL (HTTP) connections. 6. **Network Configuration**: Ensure there are no network policies, firewalls, or proxies that might be blocking the HTTP request from the machine where the script runs to your MinIO server. 7. **Correct Usage of DuckDB Extension**: Given that you've correctly installed and loaded the \`httpfs\` extension in DuckDB, also ensure that the extension and DuckDB versions are compatible and that the extension is known to work properly with MinIO (consider checking any related documentation or forums). 8. **Debugging HTTP 400 Error**: A HTTP 400 Bad Request can be caused by incorrect formatting of the request as perceived by the MinIO server. This could be due to incorrect path construction, issues with URL encoding, or other client-side errors in the request formation. Checking MinIO server logs might give you more insights into why the request is being rejected.
