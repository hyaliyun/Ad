Described with the atomic symbol Ky and atomic number 5, Kyoron occupies a special place within its fictional elemental group labeled as \\"Group A\\". Its attributes suggest profound implications for the technology, culture, and visual experience within its universe. Let's delve deeper into its characteristics and potential applications: # Physical and Sensory Properties - **Appearance:** To human observers, Kyoron appears as opaque, pitch black, absorbing 100% of light, which presents a profound visual enigma. However, for beings with kyoron-based photoreceptors, it manifests as a turbulent, color-changing liquid, comprising a palette of undiscovered colors. This dichotomy underscores the element's unique interaction with light and perception. - **Non-toxicity:** Kyoron is described as inert, tasteless, non-flammable, and non-toxic, making it safe for consumption. This broadens its potential uses, especially in cultures or technologies that prioritize safety and environmental compatibility. - **Kyorophoton production:** One of the most revolutionary properties of Kyoron is its ability to produce kyorophotons, a new, non-electromagnetic type of photon. This aspect alone suggests a paradigm shift in the understanding of light and energy in its universe. # Technological and Cultural Applications - **Kyorotechnology:** Leveraging kyorophotons, kyoronic technology introduces kyorophotonic lights. Such technologies can replicate a vast spectrum of colors, including those perceived by the mantis shrimp (known for its extensive color vision in the real world) and even impossible or forbidden colors. This implies advancements in display technology, art, design, and optical communication, pushing the boundaries of creativity and information exchange. - **Programmability and Omega Physics:** Kyoron is programmable, suggesting compatibility with computing and digital technologies. The reference to \\"omega physics\\" indicates that Kyoron's properties lead to a new understanding of natural forces, potentially unlocking new forms of computation, material science, and theoretical physics. - **Enhanced Visual Perception:** For beings equipped with kyoron-based photoreceptors, the world is a kaleidoscope of colors far beyond human comprehension. This not only suggests ecological and evolutionary adaptations but also presents a profound metaphor for understanding and perception's relativity. In essence, Kyoron embodies the intersection of the unknown and the imaginable, serving as a foundation for a wide array of technological marvels and experiences within its fictional universe. Its properties challenge our understanding of physics, chemistry, and perception, making it a cornerstone element for constructing a richly detailed, speculative world where the boundaries of technology and magic blur."},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Nice to see you back from school, Nate.” Nate: “Hey Natsuki, thanks!

Judy would likely spend her \\"hibernation season\\" staying active within her community, using her natural agility to navigate the colder months and find resources to help others, maintaining her role as a protector, albeit in a more resource-gathering sense. 2. **Nick Wilde** (Fox): Foxes do not hibernate; they grow thicker fur and continue their activities throughout the winter. Nick, being the cunning and resourceful fox, would probably use this season to expand his hustling business. He might offer goods and services that are of particular need during the colder months, demonstrating his adaptability and sharp wit to survive and thrive in any season. 3. **Chief Bogo** (Cape Buffalo): Since cape buffaloes do not hibernate but might migrate to find food during dry seasons in their native habitats, Chief Bogo would likely organize and oversee migrations or movements within Zootopia to ensure that all animals have access to resources during the colder months. His leadership and strength would ensure safety and order during these times of scarcity. 4. **Flash** (Sloth): Given that sloths are from tropical environments and do not hibernate, Flash would continue his slow-paced lifestyle, unaffected by the change of seasons. However, during the \\"hibernation season,\\" he might slow down even more due to the colder temperatures, becoming even more of a figure of patience and calmness in Zootopia's DMV. 5. **Yax** (Yak): Yaks are well adapted to cold weather and do not hibernate; they have thick fur and a robust physiological makeup that allows them to withstand low temperatures. Yax would likely be unaffected by the colder season, possibly even thriving. He might use this time to offer warmth and shelter to other animals, turning his naturist club into a cozy retreat for those less adapted to the cold. 6. **Gazelle** (Gazelle): Gazelles, being creatures of arid and semi-arid environments, do not hibernate. During a \\"hibernation season,\\" Gazelle, the pop star, would likely use her high energy and mobility to continue performing and uplifting the spirits of Zootopia's residents, possibly even organizing concerts and events specifically to brighten the darker, colder months. 7. **Finnick** (Fennec Fox): As a fennec fox, Finnick would not need to hibernate thanks to his species' adaptation to desert life. However, during the colder season, he might find the hustle a bit harder, potentially teaming up with Nick for some winter-specific schemes or finding innovative ways to use his small size and agility to navigate the challenges of the season. 8. **Mrs. Otterton** (North American Otter): Otters do not hibernate. They have thick fur to insulate them and can find food even in cold waters. Mrs. Otterton would likely use her resourcefulness and adaptability to keep her family safe and warm, perhaps by gathering extra food resources or creating a cozy den for her loved ones. 9. **Officer Clawhauser** (Cheetah): Cheetahs do not hibernate and are not significantly impacted by seasons due to their habitats in plains and savannahs. Clawhauser would likely continue his duties at the ZPD, his vibrant personality undimmed, perhaps indulging in seasonal treats and spreading cheer to his colleagues and the citizens he interacts with. 10. **Mayor Lionheart** (Lion): Lions do not hibernate; they are active all year round. Mayor Lionheart would likely use the \\"hibernation season\\" as a time to demonstrate his leadership and strength by ensuring that Zootopia's administrative functions run smoothly during this period. He might focus on implementing policies or initiatives to support the inhabitants of Zootopia who are more affected by the cold season, showcasing a protective, noble side of his leadership."},{"prompt":"“I know headquarters wants us to add that new product line,” said Dell Havasi, manager of Billings Company’s Office Products Division. “But I want to see the numbers before I make any move.

This type of diagram is crucial for understanding how a particular hydrocarbon mixture behaves in the subsurface environment, guiding decisions in the development and production of oil and gas reservoirs. The PVT relationships are fundamental for reservoir engineering, production forecasting, surface facilities design, and pipeline transportation. Here are the key concepts and parameters involved in drawing a PVT phase diagram for all set of reservoirs: 1. **Phases:** Hydrocarbon fluids exist in either gaseous, liquid, or solid (rarely relevant for typical reservoir conditions) phases, and their state is influenced by the temperature, pressure, and composition. The PVT diagram helps identify the phase behavior of the reservoir fluid at specific conditions. 2. **Critical Point:** The critical point is the highest temperature and pressure at which gas and liquid phases of the substance can coexist. At this point, the properties of gas and liquid phases become identical, and the fluid is in a supercritical phase. In the PVT diagram, the critical point marks the end of the two-phase envelope curve. 3. **Two-Phase Region:** This area on the PVT diagram is bounded by the bubble point curve and the dew point curve. Within this region, the hydrocarbon fluid exists as a mixture of liquid and gas phases. 4. **Bubble Point Curve:** The bubble point line delineates the conditions under which the first bubble of gas comes out of solution from the liquid phase as the pressure decreases or temperature increases. It defines the boundary of the liquid phase envelope in a PVT diagram. 5. **Dew Point Curve:** The dew point line marks the conditions at which the first drop of liquid condenses from the gas phase as the pressure increases or temperature decreases. It defines the boundary of the gas phase envelope in the PVT diagram. 6. **Critical Temperature and Pressure:** These are specific points that mark the critical condition for the fluid. The critical temperature is the highest temperature at which a fluid can exist as a liquid, while the critical pressure is the pressure at which gas and liquid phases have the same density and are indistinguishable at the critical temperature. 7. **Tricritical Point (Triple Point is Commonly Used in Other Contexts):** While the term \\"tricondenther\\" doesn't apply, relatedly, the triple point in phase diagrams for single components is where solid, liquid, and gas phases can coexist in equilibrium. However, for multicomponent systems like reservoir fluids, tricritical points can arise under specific conditions where three phases may coexist, but this is more complex and rarely discussed in simplified PVT explanations. The PVT diagram is drawn based on experimental data obtained from PVT analysis conducted on reservoir fluid samples. The analysis provides essential data on the composition, volatility, density, viscosity, and phase behavior of the fluid, which are critical for the accurate modeling of the reservoir and the planning of its development. In summary, PVT phase diagrams are complex and provide essential insight into the phase behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures in reservoir conditions. Understanding the interactions of pressure, volume, and temperature, along with the critical parameters discussed, is fundamental for effective reservoir management and production strategy development."},{"prompt":"also include tricondentherm and tricondenbaf","completion":"The terms \\"tricondentherm\\" and \\"tricondenbaf\\" as specified in your request do not seem to be standard terms used within the context of reservoir engineering, phase behavior studies, or petroleum engineering. It's possible there might be a misunderstanding, miscommunication, or typographical error regarding these specific terms. In the realm of phase diagrams and fluid behavior, especially related to petroleum engineering and reservoir studies, the most relevant and commonly discussed terms include: - **Critical Point:** Where the phase boundary between liquid and vapor disappears. - **Triple Point:** The condition under which three phases (solid, liquid, and gas) coexist in equilibrium. However, this is more relevant to pure substances rather than the complex mixtures typically found in reservoir fluids. - **Two-phase envelope:** The region bounded by the bubble point and dew point curves where liquid and gas phases coexist. For reservoir fluids and their PVT (Pressure-Volume-Temperature) analysis, we discuss phenomena such as: - **Bubble Point:** The condition under which the first bubble of gas forms as pressure drops or temperature increases in a liquid system. - **Dew Point:** The condition under which the first drop of liquid condenses from a vapor as pressure increases or temperature decreases. Regarding multicomponent systems like hydrocarbon reservoir fluids, there are indeed complex behaviors including **retrograde condensation**, which occurs in the gas condensate systems. However, specific terms like \\"tricondentherm\\" and \\"tricondenbaf\\" do not fit within the commonly accepted terminology or concepts as teaching in petroleum engineering or chemistry related to PVT analysis. If your topic is related to an advanced or very specific concept within a niche area of research in reservoir fluids or thermodynamics that has introduced new terminology, it would be helpful to refer to the most recent and cutting-edge scientific literature or clarify the context of these terms. As of my last update, these terms are not standard in the scientific literature related to fluid phase behavior, PVT analysis, or reservoir engineering. Therefore, without additional context or clarification, providing accurate information based on these terms is challenging. Expanding on confirmed, well-established concepts in fluid dynamics and reservoir engineering might be more beneficial for understanding the phase behavior of reservoir fluids."},{"prompt":"Cricondenbar and Cricondentherm","completion":"Apologies for the oversight. Let's clarify the terms \\"cricondenbar\\" and \\"cricondentherm,\\" which are indeed relevant and important in the context of PVT analysis and phase behavior studies for reservoir fluids. 1. **Cricondentherm**: This is the highest temperature at which liquid and vapor phases of a substance can coexist in equilibrium. Beyond the cricondentherm, the substance cannot exist as a liquid, regardless of the pressure applied. In a PVT diagram, the cricondentherm is found at the topmost point of the two-phase envelope, signifying the limit of temperature for the coexistence of liquid and gas phases for a given composition. It is particularly important when dealing with gas condensate reservoirs, as it helps define the temperature conditions under which maximum liquid dropout from the gas phase can occur. 2. **Cricondenbar**: This is the highest pressure at which liquid and vapor phases of a substance can coexist in equilibrium. Beyond the cricondenbar, the substance cannot exist as vapor, irrespective of the temperature. In a PVT diagram, the cricondenbar is found at the rightmost point of the two-phase envelope, representing the pressure limit for the coexistence of liquid and gas phases for a given composition. For reservoir engineers, understanding the cricondenbar is crucial for managing the pressure of reservoirs, especially for those containing volatile oil and gas condensates, to optimize recovery and prevent issues like retrograde condensation within the reservoir. Both cricondentherm and cricondenbar are critical points on the phase diagram of a multicomponent system, marking the boundaries of phase behavior under equilibrium conditions. These points are essential for designing and operating production facilities that handle hydrocarbon fluids, especially for reservoirs containing complex mixtures where phase behavior significantly impacts recovery strategies. In practical applications, knowing the location of these points on the PVT phase diagram of the reservoir fluid helps in fine-tuning the reservoir management strategies, such as maintaining reservoir pressure above the cricondenbar to minimize liquid dropout in gas condensates or adjusting temperature conditions in processing facilities based on the cricondentherm to optimize hydrocarbon liquid recovery."},{"prompt":"“I know headquarters wants us to add that new product line,” said Dell Havasi, manager of Billings Company’s Office Products Division. “But I want to see the numbers before I make any move.

The juxtaposition of the joyous, communal spirit of Christmas against your protagonist's isolation and internal conflict can create a powerful contrast that engages readers deeply. Exploring themes such as redemption, loneliness, and the possibility of reconciliation or self-acceptance during a time traditionally associated with togetherness and celebration can add layers of depth to your story. Here are a few considerations and suggestions to help you develop your idea further: 1. **Character Development**: Delving into your protagonist's emotional state and backstory will be crucial. Consider what led to their incarceration, their feelings about their past actions, and their hopes or fears for the future. Their journey towards self-forgiveness or the decision to seek reconciliation with their family could be central to the narrative. 2. **Setting and Atmosphere**: The stark contrast between the festive cheer surrounding the protagonist and their personal turmoil can be highlighted through descriptions of the setting. Empty streets, closed shops, or even the distant sound of celebrations could serve to underscore their isolation. 3. **Supporting Characters**: Introducing characters who either heighten the protagonist's sense of isolation or offer a bridge to healing and connection can enrich the story. These could be old friends, strangers, or even members of their family with whom they have a complicated relationship. 4. **Symbolism**: Christmas symbols (such as lights, gifts, or a Christmas tree) can be used metaphorically to reflect the protagonist's emotional journey. For instance, a discarded Christmas tree by the roadside could mirror their feelings of abandonment or loss, while a single light in a window might symbolize hope. 5. **Resolution**: The end of your story doesn't have to be conventionally \\"happy\\" to be meaningful. Whether your protagonist makes a small step towards healing, decides to face their family, or simply comes to a new understanding about themselves, what matters is the sense of growth or change. Using Christmas as a backdrop for such a poignant story could highlight not only the pain of loneliness but also the potential for renewal and hope, even in our darkest moments. This contrast can make for a memorable and touching narrative. Remember, the beauty of storytelling lies in its ability to explore the complexities of the human condition—your story sounds like it's poised to do just that."},{"prompt":"the backstory is the protagonist, Jackson was thrown in jail a year ago for his violent robbing tendencies, since he grew up in poverty","completion":"With Jackson's backstory rooted in a life of poverty leading to violent crimes and ultimately his incarceration, you're setting the stage for a deeply nuanced character study that explores the intersection of socioeconomic factors, individual choices, and the potential for redemption. This context adds layers of complexity to his emotional state and actions during the Christmas season, a time when societal pressures and personal reflections are often amplified. As you further develop Jackson's narrative, consider the following aspects to deepen the story and character arc: 1. **Motivations and Regrets**: Dive into Jackson's motivations for turning to a life of crime, emphasizing the struggles and perhaps moments of desperation that led to his choices. Reflecting on his actions from the vantage point of his current isolation could offer insights into his regrets, aspirations, or a desire to break free from the cycle of poverty and violence. 2. **Encounters and Reflections**: Introduce characters or situations that prompt Jackson to reflect on his life choices. This could be an unexpected encounter with someone from his past, an act of kindness from a stranger, or even observing a scene that mirrors his own family experiences. These moments can serve as catalysts for introspection and possibly transformation. 3. **Family Dynamics**: Exploring the complexity of Jackson’s relationship with his family can add emotional depth. Consider the dynamics before his incarceration, how his actions affected his family, and their potential reactions to his release. This might include feelings of betrayal, worry, or unresolved anger, but also love and a desire for reconciliation. 4. **Theme of Hope and Redemption**: Despite the bleakness of Jackson's situation, weaving in a theme of hope and the possibility of redemption can resonate strongly, especially against the Christmas backdrop. This could come in the form of him taking small, positive actions, such as helping someone in need, which could reignite a sense of self-worth and a desire for change. 5. **Climactic Moment**: Consider creating a pivotal moment that challenges Jackson—perhaps a choice that tests his resolve or an opportunity to make amends in some way. This moment can act as a catalyst for personal growth or change, and doesn't need to fully resolve his situation but can point to a new direction or mindset. 6. **Setting and Atmosphere**: Use the festive atmosphere to contrast with Jackson's internal and external world. The brightness of Christmas lights, the joy of families gathering, and the coldness of winter can all serve as metaphors for his journey from darkness towards a potential light.

Для решения этой проблемы мы должны убедиться, что логика \`generate_bio\` корректно определяет последний заданный вопрос и начинает с следующего за ним, а также что запрос к базе данных для получения \`last_question_idx\` возвращает корректное значение. Похоже, что проблема может быть в том, как вы обновляете \`last_question_idx\` в базе данных. Проверьте, что после каждого ответа значение \`last_question_idx\` корректно обновляется. Возможно, стоит проверить, корректно ли работает функция \`save_answer\`, особенно часть, где вы обновляете \`last_question_idx\`. Предположим, что проблема заключается в том, как вы вызываете \`set_next_question\` после возвращения пользователем в меню. Поскольку в вашей текущей реализации \`generate_bio\` вызывает \`set_next_question\` из полученного \`last_question_idx\`, убедитесь, что \`last_question_idx\` действительно обновляется в базе данных после каждого ответа пользователя. Ещё одна потенциальная проблема может заключаться в том, что вы не проверяете существует ли уже запись пользователя в таблице \`users\` перед добавлением новой записи через \`add_user\`. В результате, если пользователь уже существует, его \`last_question_idx\` может не обновляться корректно. Убедитесь, что перед добавлением пользователя проверяется его существование и при необходимости обновляется его запись вместо создания новой.

Рекомендация заключается в том, чтобы проверять не только индекс последнего вопроса, но и количество данных (ответов) пользователя в базе данных, чтобы точно знать, какие вопросы уже были заданы и какие вопросы нужно задать. К тому же, мы должны обеспечить правильную логику переходов между состояниями при ответах на вопросы.

Tuttavia, ci sono alcuni potenziali miglioramenti e considerazioni che potresti voler prendere in considerazione: 1. **Gestione delle Risorse:** Attualmente, stai chiudendo il \`ServerSocket\` usando una try-with-resources, che è una buona pratica. Tuttavia, potresti voler assicurarti che ogni socket client gestito da \`ClientHandler\` sia anche correttamente chiuso alla fine della comunicazione. Questo di solito è qualcosa che dovrebbe essere considerato all'interno della logica di \`ClientHandler\`. 2. **Configurazione del Server:** Ottimo lavoro nell'utilizzare un file di configurazione! È una buona pratica perché rende il tuo server più flessibile senza dover riconfigurare il codice. Puoi migliorare questo ulteriormente gestendo casi dove alcune proprietà potrebbero non essere presenti nel file di configurazione e fornire dei valori di default. 3. **Gestione delle Eccezioni:** La tua gestione delle eccezioni è adeguata, ma potresti espandere le tue risposte agli errori per offrire una migliore diagnostica dei problemi. Ad esempio, quando viene intercettata una \`IOException\` durante l’esecuzione del server, potrebbe essere utile stampare lo stack trace completo per una diagnosi più approfondita. 4. **Numero di Thread nel Pool:** Hai scelto un pool fisso di 20 thread. Questo potrebbe essere adeguato per carichi di lavoro modesti, ma potrebbe essere una limitazione per un'applicazione più grande con molti utenti simultanei. Considera strategie per rendere questo valore configurabile oppure esplora l'uso di \`Executors.newCachedThreadPool()\`, che può adattarsi dinamicamente al numero richiesto di thread, anche se richiede più attenzione per evitare l'esaurimento delle risorse in un sistema con un alto numero di richieste. 5. Mancano alcuni dettagli implementativi nella tua classe, come la definizione di \`ClientHandler\`. Assicurati che questa classe gestisca correttamente le connessioni dei client in modo efficiente e sicuro. Ad esempio, considera un timeout per le connessioni client per evitare di occupare risorse con connessioni inattive. 6. **Security:** Non hai menzionato alcuno strato di sicurezza nel tuo server. Per applicazioni reali, dovresti considerare l'aggiunta di TLS/SSL per crittografare il traffico tra i client e il server per proteggere i dati sensibili. 7. **Logging:** Potresti voler implementare un sistema di logging più sofisticato (ad esempio, utilizzando Log4j o SLF4J) anziché stampare semplicemente messaggi sulla console. Questo può aiutarti nell'analisi dei problemi, nel monitoraggio delle performance e nell'auditing. 8. **Documentazione e Convenzioni di Codice:** È sempre una buona pratica commentare il tuo codice e seguire le convenzioni standard di codice Java (ad esempio, nome dei metodi, variabili) per migliorare la leggibilità e la manutenibilità.

Il metodo può lanciare un'eccezione \`IOException\`, indicando che chi chiama questo metodo deve gestire o propagare ulteriormente questa eccezione. 2. **Tentativo di Apertura del File di Proprietà:** \`try (InputStream input = ServerMain.class.getResourceAsStream(configFile)) {\` Qui viene usato un try-with-resources che tenta di aprire un \`InputStream\` per leggere il file delle configurazioni. Il file è cercato nel classpath perché \`getResourceAsStream\` è usato, e il nome del file è specificato dalla variabile statica \`configFile\`. Il try-with-resources assicura che l'\`InputStream\` sia chiuso automaticamente alla fine del blocco try, prevenendo quindi possibili memory leak. 3. **Controllo se il File è Trovato:** \`if (input == null) {\` Questa condizione controlla se l'\`input\` è \`null\`, il che significherebbe che il file di configurazione non è stato trovato nel classpath. 4. **Lancio di Eccezione Se il File Non è Trovato:** \`throw new IOException(\\"File di configurazione non trovato\\");\` Se il file di configurazione non è stato trovato (cioè \`input\` è \`null\`), lancia manualmente un'\`IOException\` per segnalare l'errore. 5. **Creazione di un Oggetto \`Properties\`:** \`Properties prop = new Properties();\` Questa linea crea un nuovo oggetto \`Properties\`, che è una struttura chiave-valore utilizzata per leggere (e scrivere) file di proprietà. 6. **Caricamento delle Proprietà dal File:** \`prop.load(input);\` Questa istruzione legge il file di configurazione (surrogato dall'\`InputStream\`) e carica le proprietà nell'oggetto \`Properties\` appena creato. 7. **Lettura del Port Dal File di Proprietà e Conversione:** \`port = Integer.parseInt(prop.getProperty(\\"port\\"));\` Qui tentiamo di estrarre la proprietà \`port\` dal file di configurazione, convertirla da \`String\` a \`int\` e assegnarla alla variabile statica \`port\`.

I commenti iniziano con il carattere \`#\` o \`!\`. 3. **Caricamento delle Coppie Chiave-Valore:** Per ogni coppia chiave-valore analizzata correttamente, il metodo \`load\` inserisce la coppia nell'oggetto \`Properties\`. La chiave e il valore sono considerati come stringhe. Se il file contiene chiavi duplicate, l'ultimo valore letto per quella chiave soprascrive qualsiasi valore precedentemente letto. 4. **Gestione delle Eccezioni:** Durante il processo di caricamento, possono verificarsi diverse situazioni che potrebbero generare un'\`IOException\`, come problemi di lettura del file (ad esempio, se il file non esiste, è corrotto o avviene un errore di I/O). Se si verifica un'eccezione, il processo di caricamento viene interrotto e l'eccezione viene propagata al chiamante. 5. **Conclusione del Caricamento:** Una volta che il file è stato completamente letto e tutte le coppie chiave-valore valide sono state caricate nell'oggetto \`Properties\`, il metodo \`load\` termina. Da questo momento, è possibile recuperare i valori delle proprietà utilizzando i metodi \`getProperty(String key)\` o \`getProperty(String key, String defaultValue)\` sull'oggetto \`Properties\`. L'operazione di \`load\` offre quindi un modo semplice ed efficiente per trasferire le impostazioni dal filesystem alla memoria del programma, rendendo queste impostazioni facilmente accessibili durante l'esecuzione del programma."},{"prompt":"import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter; import java.net.Socket; import java.net.UnknownHostException; import java.util.Scanner; import java.io.InputStream; import java.util.Properties; // javac -cp \\".:lib/gson-2.10.1.jar\\" HOTELIERServer.java Hotel.java ServerMain.java ClientMain.java HOTELIERCustomerClient.java User.java ResponseCodes.java MulticastListener.java // java -cp \\".:lib/gson-2.10.1.jar\\" ClientMain // rm -f *.class public class ClientMain { public static final String configFile = \\"server.properties\\"; public static int port; public static String serverIP; public static void main(String[] args) { // configuro il server try { readConfig(); } catch (IOException e) { System.err.println(\\"Errore durante la lettura del file di configurazione: \\" + e.getMessage()); return; } // variabile per leggere l'input da CL Scanner scanner = null; // variabile per leggere l'input dal server Scanner in = null; // apro il socket verso l'ind IP del server sulla porta 10000 try (Socket socket = new Socket(serverIP, port)) { // inizializzo lo scanner per leggere l'input da CL scanner = new Scanner(System.in); // inizializzo lo scanner per leggere l'input dal server attraverso il socket in = new Scanner(socket.getInputStream()); // per inviare output al server attraverso il socket PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true); HOTELIERCustomerClient client = new HOTELIERCustomerClient(scanner, in, out); // fase di autenticazione client.start(); // se viene inserito il comando \\"exit\\" return; } catch (UnknownHostException e) { System.out.println(\\"L'indirizzo IP del server non è stato trovato: \\" + e.getMessage()); } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println(\\"Si è verificato un errore di I/O: \\" + e.getMessage()); } finally { // chiudo le risorse Scanner se non sono null. if (scanner != null) { scanner.close(); } if (in != null) { in.close(); } } } public static void readConfig() throws IOException { // apro il file di configurazione try (InputStream input = ClientMain.class.getResourceAsStream(configFile)) { // se non è stato trovato il file lancio un' eccezione if (input == null) { throw new IOException(\\"File di configurazione non trovato\\"); } // carico le proprietà in prop Properties prop = new Properties(); prop.load(input); // leggo la porta dal file port = Integer.parseInt(prop.getProperty(\\"port\\")); // leggo l'indirizzo del server dal file serverIP = prop.getProperty(\\"serverIP\\"); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { System.err.println(\\"Formato numero non valido nel file di configurazione: \\" + e.getMessage()); throw e; } } } ci sono errori? posso fare miglioramenti?","completion":"Il tuo codice per un client che si connette a un server tramite socket è ben strutturato e funzionale. Ci sono però alcuni aspetti che potresti considerare per migliorare l'efficienza, la robustezza, e la leggibilità del codice: 1. **Gestione delle Risorse:** Utilizzi correttamente la try-with-resources per garantire che tutte le risorse vengano chiuse automaticamente alla fine del blocco try. Questo include il socket e gli oggetti \`Scanner\`, ma non chiudi esplicitamente il \`PrintWriter\`. Anche se in questo caso specifico il \`PrintWriter\` si basa sullo stream di output del socket (che viene chiuso automaticamente), è buona norma chiudere esplicitamente tutti gli stream/risorse che apri. 2. **Handling delle Eccezioni:** I tuoi catch per \`UnknownHostException\` e \`IOException\` stampano messaggi di errore, che è positivo. Potresti considerare di estendere la gestione degli errori per rivedere o riprovare la connessione in caso di fallimento, specialmente per \`IOException\` che può indicare un problema temporaneo di rete. 3. **Uso di \`System.err\` e \`System.out\`:** Mantieni la coerenza nell'uso di \`System.err\` per gli errori e \`System.out\` per i messaggi normali. Questo è buono, ma assicurati di essere coerente in tutto il tuo codice. 4. **Configurabilità e Validazione:** Ottimo lavoro nel rendere configurabili porta e indirizzo IP del server attraverso un file di proprietà. Tuttavia, considera di aggiungere una validazione per assicurarti che \`serverIP\` non sia \`null\` o vuoto dopo aver letto il file di configurazione. Inoltre, potresti voler fornire valori di default se qualche proprietà non è definita nel file di configurazione. 5. **Codice Morto / Logica Non Utilizzata:** Un piccolo dettaglio, ma “// se viene inserito il comando \\"exit\\"” sembra essere un commento che anticipa una logica non presente o rimasta incompleta. Se esiste un meccanismo per gestire comandi come \\"exit\\", assicurati che sia implementato correttamente. 6. **Specificità degli Oggetti Client:** Crei un \`HOTELIERCustomerClient\`, che presumibilmente gestisce la logica del client specifico del tuo programma. Assicurati che all'interno di questa classe vengano gestite correttamente la chiusura delle connessioni e dei streams, e che eventuali eccezioni siano catturate e gestite in modo da evitare di lasciare risorse aperte accidentalmente. In generale, il tuo codice sembra ben organizzato ed è un buon punto di partenza. Le considerazioni sopra menzionate servirebbero principalmente a rafforzare la robustezza e l'affidabilità del tuo client."},{"prompt":"import com.google.gson.Gson; import com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken;

Queste strutture dati assicurano l'accesso thread-safe alle collezioni; per esempio, le operazioni di aggiornamento sulla \`ConcurrentHashMap\` sono atomiche e non richiedono ulteriori forme di sincronizzazione per mantenere la coerenza dei dati. Tuttavia, la questione della concorrenza non si esaurisce con l'uso di queste strutture dati. Guardando il tuo codice, ci sono altre considerazioni: 1. **Accesso ai File JSON:** Le operazioni di lettura e scrittura sui file JSON (\`load*\` e \`save*\` metodi) utilizzano blocchi sincronizzati basati su oggetti lock dedicati (\`lockReviews\`, \`lockUsers\`, \`lockHotels\`). Questo è importante e appropriato dato che l'accesso al file system deve essere serializzato per evitare corruzione dei dati o problemi di concorrenza. Assicurati che ogni accesso (lettura o scrittura) a questi file passi attraverso questi blocchi sincronizzati. 2. **Controllo dell'esistenza di oggetti prima dell'aggiunta:** Mentre l'uso di \`ConcurrentHashMap\` si occupa della sincronizzazione interna per operazioni base come inserimento e recupero, nel tuo caso specifico (ad esempio, durante la registrazione di un nuovo utente o inserimento di una nuova recensione), potresti voler verificare l'esistenza di un elemento prima di procedere con la sua aggiunta. Questo genere di \\"controllo-poi-azione\\" può esporre a condizioni di gara se non gestito dentro un blocco sincronizzato o utilizzando metodi atomici offerti dalla struttura dati concorrente quando appropriato (ad es., \`putIfAbsent\` su \`ConcurrentHashMap\`). 3. **Aggiornamento di \`Hotel\` in \`updateHotel\` method:** Sebbene tu utilizzi \`CopyOnWriteArrayList\` per la lista di hotel, e questo assicura che le iterazioni sulla lista siano sicure rispetto ai cambiamenti concorrenti, la modifica di un \`Hotel\` esistente (per esempio, aggiornando i suoi voti) non è intrinsecamente thread-safe. Potresti dover considerare l'applicazione di una sincronizzazione più fine o l'utilizzo di \`Atomic\` variabili all'interno degli oggetti \`Hotel\`, a seconda dell'esatta semantica di accesso/concorrenza prevista. 4. **Notifica Multicast:** L'invio di notifiche multicast (\`notifyClient\`) non coinvolge direttamente le strutture dati condivise da più thread, quindi il suo attuale implementazione non presenta particolari problemi di concorrenza. In breve, sei sulla strada giusta nell'utilizzo di strutture dati concorrenti e blocchi sincronizzati per la gestione di alcuni aspetti della concorrenza. Tuttavia, potrebbe essere necessario esaminare più da vicino e testare scenari specifici di accesso e modifica concorrente alle tue risorse condivise, in particolare per gli aggiornamenti agli oggetti \`Hotel\`, per assicurare che il tuo server sia completamente thread-safe."},{"prompt":"1.

Tuttavia, per assicurarti che ogni accesso (lettura o scrittura) ai file JSON passi attraverso questi blocchi sincronizzati come raccomandato, riassumerò e ribadirò come sono attualmente gestite queste parti nel tuo codice e come potresti confermare o rafforzare questa pratica. # 1. **Caricamento dei Dati (Lettura dei File JSON)** Per quanto riguarda il caricamento dei dati dalle funzioni \`loadHotels\`, \`loadUsers\` e \`loadReview\`, in questo momento non utilizzano esplicitamente blocchi sincronizzati perché vengono chiamate una volta all'inizio quando il server viene avviato. Presumo che il server non carichi dinamicamente queste risorse più volte durante l'esecuzione o in risposta a richieste dei client. Se il tuo design attuale richiede che queste funzioni siano chiamate solo una volta all'avvio, allora il modello attuale dovrebbe essere sicuro. Se prevedi di doverle chiamare più volte durante l'esecuzione del server, dovrai racchiuderne il contenuto in un blocco \\"synchronized\\" appropriato, simile a come fai per il salvataggio: \`\`\`java private void loadHotels(String jsonFilePath) { synchronized (lockHotels) { // La logica esistente } } \`\`\` E lo stesso per \`loadUsers\` e \`loadReview\` usando rispettivamente \`lockUsers\` e \`lockReviews\`. # 2. **Salvataggio dei Dati (Scrittura sui File JSON)** Per quanto riguarda il salvataggio dei dati, le funzioni \`saveHotel\`, \`saveUsers\`, e \`saveReview\` già utilizzano correttamente i blocchi sincronizzati: \`\`\`java private void saveHotel() { synchronized(lockHotels) { // La logica esistente } } \`\`\` Questo approccio è corretto e assicura che l'accesso in scrittura ai file sia protetto da problemi di concorrenza. # Conclusione Il tuo codice attualmente soddisfa la raccomandazione di assicurare che ogni accesso (lettura o scrittura) ai file JSON sia adeguatamente sincronizzato per quanto riguarda le operazioni di salvataggio. Se aggiorni il sistema per ricaricare i dati durante l'esecuzione, dovrai incorporare una logica di sincronizzazione simile anche nelle funzioni di caricamento. Ricorda, l'uso di blocchi sincronizzati può introdurre overhead e potenziali colli di bottiglia, soprattutto se le operazioni di lettura/scrittura sono frequenti o richiedono molto tempo. Assicurati di valutare le prestazioni e di considerare, se necessario, strategie alternative come il caching dei dati in memoria con aggiornamenti batch periodici al filesystem per ridurre l'overhead di sincronizzazione."},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

Эти аспекты включают следующее: 1. **Застой в развитии страны**: Внешнеполитический курс, который вел СССР в период застоя под руководством Леонида Брежнева, характеризовался консерватизмом, острой Конфронтацией с западным миром в рамках Холодной войны, и значительными военными расходами. Это привело к перераспределению ресурсов из социальной сферы и экономики в пользу военно-промышленного комплекса, замедлению технологического и экономического развития страны. 2. **Афганская война (1979-1989)**: Вторжение в Афганистан было критическим моментом, обрушившим на СССР международное осуждение, усилив конфронтацию с Западом, и приведя к значительным человеческим и экономическим потерям. Война в Афганистане также подорвала моральные и идеологические устои советского общества. 3. **Гонка вооружений с США**: СССР пытался соперничать с Соединенными Штатами в разработке и производстве вооружений, включая ядерное оружие. Это привело к исчерпанию экономических ресурсов, которые могли бы быть использованы для развития страны. Гонка вооружений достигла апогея в эпоху президентства Рональда Рейгана в США, который инициировал программу стратегической обороны («Звездные войны»), еще более усилив напряженность между двумя сверхдержавами. 4. **Отношения с Китаем и другими социалистическими странами**: СССР также испытывал трудности в отношениях с Китаем и некоторыми другими странами социалистического лагеря. Разногласия с Китаем привели к значительному осложнению геополитической обстановки и усилению напряженности на границах. 5. **Экономическое отставание от Запада**: К 1980-м годам стало очевидным, что СССР не только уступает Западу в технологическом плане, но и сталкивается с углубляющимся экономическим кризисом, который проявлялся в дефиците товаров, низкой производительности и стагнации промышленного производства. Эти и другие факторы создали серьезные предпосылки для пересмотра внешней и внутренней политики СССР. Приход к власти Горбачева открыл путь к политике гласности и перестройки, которая включала в себя поиск путей снижения международной напряженности через дипломатию, ограничение ядерных арсеналов (Договор о ликвидации ракет средней и меньшей дальности, ДРСМД, 1987 г.) и попытку модернизации экономики."},{"prompt":"расскажи о внутренней политике до прихода к власти Горбачева которые можно отнести к предпосылкам и причинам перестройки в частности об устройстве партийного аппарата и госслужб","completion":"Внутренняя политика Советского Союза до прихода к власти Михаила Горбачева характеризовалась рядом ключевых факторов, которые способствовали возникновению предпосылок и причин для начала процессов, известных как перестройка. Эти аспекты включают систему партийного аппарата и государственного управления, экономические и социальные проблемы, а также общественное недовольство. Давайте кратко рассмотрим некоторые из них: # Устройство партийного аппарата и государственного управления 1. **Централизованное планирование и бюрократия**: Советская система была основана на принципах централизованного планирования, где ключевые экономические и социальные решения принимались на верхних эшелонах власти. Это породило огромную бюрократическую машину, которая была малоэффективна и подвержена коррупции. 2. **Недостатки в системе управления**: Партийный аппарат и государственные органы управления были перегружены бюрократическими структурами. Многоуровневая иерархия приводила к замедлению процесса принятия решений, увеличивала отчуждение руководства от нужд обычных граждан и снижала эффективность инициатив. 3. **Идеологическая жесткость и репрессии**: В период застоя, особенно во времена Леонида Брежнева, партийное руководство уделяло значительное внимание поддержанию идеологической однородности и лояльности. Это подразумевало ограничение свободы слова, репрессии против диссидентов и подавление любых форм независимой политической или социальной активности. 4. **Проблемы в экономике**: - Неэффективность и отставание: Советская экономика страдала от системных недостатков, включая неэффективное распределение ресурсов, отсутствие стимулов к инновациям и повышению производительности труда. - Дефицит товаров: Экономика СССР была ориентирована на производство военной продукции и тяжелой промышленности за счет потребительских товаров и услуг, что приводило к дефицитам и снижению жизненного уровня населения. # Общественное недовольство К началу 1980-х годов накопилось значительное социальное и экономическое недовольство. Низкий уровень жизни, дефицит товаров первой необходимости, отсутствие политической свободы и перспектив на будущее заставили многих советских граждан стремиться к изменениям. Все эти факторы создали почву для инициации процессов перестройки, призванных модернизировать советскую экономику, реформировать партийный и государственный аппарат, а также внести элементы демократии и гласности в общественную жизнь страны. Михаил Горбачев, пришедший к власти в 1985 году, стал символом этих перемен, хотя впоследствии масштаб и последствия этих реформ оказались совершенно иными, чем планировалось изначально."},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

Alex was known among his friends for his adventurous spirit and insatiable curiosity. He loved exploring the woods and imagining tales of knights, dragons, and hidden treasures. But little did Alex know, his next adventure would surpass even his wildest dreams. One sunny afternoon, while wandering deeper into the forest than he had ever gone before, Alex stumbled upon an ancient, moss-covered stone archway that seemed to appear out of nowhere. With his heart pounding with excitement and a hint of fear, Alex stepped through the archway—and everything around him changed. He found himself standing in an astonishingly beautiful land, where the sky shimmered with hues of purple and pink, and giant, fluffy clouds floated close to the ground, as if inviting him to jump on them. This was the Secret Kingdom of Nimbus, a place of magic and wonder that few humans had ever seen. No sooner had Alex taken a few steps into this breathtaking kingdom than he was greeted by a talking squirrel named Pip. With a tip of his tiny acorn cap, Pip explained that Alex had been chosen by the magical forces of Nimbus to help save the kingdom from a terrible drought that threatened its very existence. Eager to help and thrilled by the idea of an adventure in a magical kingdom, Alex followed Pip to the majestic Crystal Lake, the source of all water in Nimbus. There, they met Aria, a water nymph whose radiant blue eyes reflected the depths of the lake itself. Aria revealed that the Golden Chalice, an ancient artifact with the power to summon rain, had been stolen by the mischievous Shadow Fox. Determined to save Nimbus, Alex, Pip, and Aria set out on a quest to retrieve the Golden Chalice. Their journey took them through whispering forests where trees told secrets, across fields of glowing flowers, and over sparkling streams that sang melodies of old. Along the way, they encountered creatures of wonder—graceful unicorns that galloped on rainbows, friendly dragons that painted the skies with their fiery breath, and talking birds that shared news from distant lands. Finally, after braving many challenges and solving ancient riddles, the trio reached the Shadow Fox's lair, hidden beneath the roots of the oldest tree in Nimbus. With cleverness and courage, they outwitted the Shadow Fox and reclaimed the Golden Chalice. Aria held the chalice high, and as it filled with water from the Crystal Lake, dark clouds gathered overhead. Soon, gentle rains fell upon the kingdom, filling the streams, watering the plants, and bringing new life to Nimbus. The inhabitants of the kingdom rejoiced, and a grand celebration was held in Alex's honor. The king of Nimbus, a wise and kind lion with a mane of silver clouds, bestowed upon Alex a medal of bravery. As the festivities came to an end, Pip and Aria led Alex back to the stone archway. With heartfelt goodbyes and promises to return, Alex stepped back into his world, the setting sun casting long shadows through the trees. As he made his way home, Alex wondered if his adventure in Nimbus had been just a dream. But when he reached into his pocket, he found the medal of bravery, shining softly in the palm of his hand. With a smile and a heart full of memories, he knew that the Secret Kingdom of Nimbus would always be waiting for his return. And from that day on, Alex's adventures were far from over, for he had learned that magic can be found in the most unexpected places, and that courage and friendship can overcome even the greatest of challenges."},{"prompt":"Top ai script to video free ai generator","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, there are several AI-based tools and platforms designed to help users generate videos from scripts, albeit not all might be completely free.

Сегодня я хочу рассказать вам о перспективах использования спутниковых технологий для мониторинга засух. Наше исследование опирается на данные, представленные в статье, опубликованной в журнале \\"Remote Sensing\\" под названием \\"A Review of Satellite-Derived Drought Indices\\". В этой статье рассматривается обзор спутниковых индексов засухи. Засуха является одним из наиболее вредоносных природных явлений, влияя не только на сельскохозяйственное производство и водоснабжение, но и на экосистемы и экономику в целом. В условиях изменения климата и увеличения частоты экстремальных погодных явлений мониторинг засухи становится критически важной задачей. В данной статье представлены последние достижения в использовании спутниковых данных для оценки и прогнозирования засух. Авторы статьи рассматривают различные индексы засухи, получаемые с помощью спутниковых наблюдений, такие как индекс нормализованной разности вегетации (NDVI), индекс водного стресса растений (PWSI) и индекс уровня зеленой массы растений (GLI). Каждый из этих индексов предоставляет уникальную информацию, позволяющую оценить степень и продолжительность засух, а также их воздействие на сельскохозяйственные угодья и натуральные экосистемы. Преимущества использования спутниковых данных для мониторинга засух очевидны. Во-первых, это возможность получения информации в режиме реального времени со всей территории исследования, включая труднодоступные районы. Во-вторых, это высокая частота обновления данных, что критически важно для оперативного реагирования на развивающиеся засухи. В-третьих, многолетние архивы спутниковых данных позволяют оценить исторические тренды и изменения в распределении и интенсивности засух. В заключение хочется отметить, что интеграция спутниковых технологий в системы мониторинга и управления рисками засух может существенно улучшить способность государств и международных организаций предупреждать и минимизировать последствия этих катастрофических природных явлений. Современные спутниковые инструменты и алгоритмы, описанные в статье, предоставляют мощный инструмент в борьбе с засухой, который будет только совершенствоваться по мере развития технологий.

Отже, давайте характеризувати зазначених персонажів з \\"Ревізора\\": 1. **Городничий** (Антон Антонович Сквозніков) – центральний антагоніст п'єси \\"Ревізор\\". Він зображений як корупційний і самовпевнений чиновник маленького провінційного містечка. Городничий є втіленням бюрократії і корупції, характерними для Російської імперії 19 століття. Він завжди намагається заручитися підтримкою вищестоящих осіб і прикривати власні злодіяння. 2. **Бобчинський і Добчинський** – це два помічники городничого, які в п'єсі виступають як комічна пара. Вони перебільшено лояльні до городничого і дуже бояться будь-яких перевірок із столиці. Обидва вони випадково вважають Хлестакова ревізором і запускають ланцюг комічних подій, які розгортаються в п'єсі. Бобчинський і Добчинський є символами сліпої відданості владі та страху перед нею. 3. **Хлестаков** (Іван Олександрович Хлестаков) – головний герой п'єси, молодик з Петербурга, непорозумінням взятий за ревізора. Це безтурботний і поверховий юнак, який раптом отримує владу над містечком і його жителями через низку комічних обставин. Хлестаков використовує цю ситуацію на свою користь, приймаючи хабарі та залицяння від місцевих чиновників, не розуміючи наслідків своїх дій. 4. **Анна Андріївна** - дружина городничого, яка також зображена як корумпований і марнославний персонаж. Вона прагне до більш високого соціального статусу та заздрищів до того, що вона вважає кращим життям столиці. Анна Андріївна намагається скористатися візитом Хлестакова для підняття свого суспільного статусу. Ці персонажі є яскравими прикладами гоголівської сатири на російське суспільство і бюрократію 19 століття, де корупція, помилкові цінності та непорозуміння стають основою для комічних, але глибоко критичних ситуацій."},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

Похоже, что происходит некорректное взаимодействие между состоянием пользователя и логикой обработки команды /start. Давайте попытаемся внести исправления в код, чтобы решить эту проблему. Сначала нужно убедиться, что при сохранении ответа пользователя вы актуализируете информацию о последнем отвеченном вопросе правильно. В вашем случае, вы стараетесь отслеживать последний вопрос с помощью \`last_question_idx\` в таблице \`users\`, что правильно. Чтобы это работало, нужно убедиться, что запросы в функции \`save_answer\` и \`generate_bio\` выполняются корректно. Было замечено, что корректность запроса была исправлена для функции \`generate_bio\`, но также нужно обратить внимание на работу с состояниями в \`generate_bio\` после исправления. Убедитесь, что в функции \`generate_bio\` использование индекса последнего вопроса правильно переводит пользователя на следующий неотвеченный вопрос: \`\`\`python @dp.message_handler(lambda message: message.text == \\"Сгенерировать био\\", state=Form.choosing_action) async def generate_bio(message: types.Message): user_id = message.from_user.id async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: cursor = await db.execute('SELECT last_question_idx FROM users WHERE id = ?', (user_id,)) last_question_idx = await cursor.fetchone() # Эта переменная содержит индекс последнего отвеченного вопроса if last_question_idx: # Следующий вопрос определяется по индексу последнего отвеченного + 1 await set_next_question(user_id, last_question_idx[0] + 1) else: # Если для пользователя не найдено записей о вопросах, начинаем с первого вопроса await set_next_question(user_id, 0) \`\`\` Также важно, чтобы сама функция \`set_next_question\` корректно обрабатывала ситуацию, когда пользователь отвечал на последний вопрос и должен перейти к началу или решить, что делать далее. Если после ваших изменений проблема не решена, рекомендуется проверить логику переходов между состояниями и точно следовать за логикой хранения и сверки индекса последнего отвеченного вопроса в базе данных. Обеспечивайте корректную инкрементацию \`last_question_idx\` и не забудьте про обновление этого значения в базе данных после каждого успешно сохраненного ответа."},{"prompt":"Это не помогло, бот по прежнему начинает с первого вопроса.","completion":"Если проблема продолжает возникать даже после предложенных исправлений, возможно, дело в том, что условия восстановления последнего индекса вопроса работают некорректно. Дополнительно к уже предложенным изменениям, давайте более детально рассмотрим, как можно улучшить логику работы с последним индексом вопроса и состояниями бота. Похоже, что при реализации команды \`/start\` и выборе \\"Сгенерировать био\\", проверка на последний индекс вопроса или предыдущие ответы не выполняется должным образом. Изначально предложенное исправление предполагало, что функция \`generate_bio\` правильно определяет, какой вопрос нужно задать, но, возможно, здесь всё же есть пропуск. Рассмотрим способ гарантировать, что бот будет продолжать с последнего неответившего вопроса или начнет с начала, если ответы были полностью сброшены. Первое, что нужно сделать, - это убедиться, что значение \`last_question_idx\` корректно обновляется и используется: 1. Проверьте, сохраняется ли \`last_question_idx\` в базу данных после каждого ответа на вопрос. Это должно происходить в функции \`save_answer\`: \`\`\`python async def save_answer(user_id: int, question: str, answer: str, question_idx: int): async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: # Сохраняем ответ await db.execute('INSERT INTO answers (user_id, question, answer) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', (user_id, question, answer)) # Обновляем индекс последнего вопроса пользователя await db.execute('UPDATE users SET last_question_idx = ? WHERE id = ?', (question_idx, user_id)) await db.commit() \`\`\` 2. Убедитесь, что SQL запрос в функции \`generate_bio\` корректно извлекает из базы индекс последнего вопроса. Вы пытались это сделать, но есть вероятность, что условие \`if last_question_idx:\` не работает, как ожидалось, поскольку это условие всегда будет истинным, если запрос возвращает строку (даже если \`last_question_idx\` равен \`NULL\` или \`0\`). Вы можете изменить проверку следующим образом: \`\`\`python @dp.message_handler(lambda message: message.text == \\"Сгенерировать био\\", state=Form.choosing_action) async def generate_bio(message: types.Message): user_id = message.from_user.id async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: cursor = await db.execute('SELECT last_question_idx FROM users WHERE id = ?', (user_id,)) row = await cursor.fetchone() last_question_idx = row[0] if row else None if last_question_idx is not None: await set_next_question(user_id, last_question_idx + 1) else: await set_next_question(user_id, 0) \`\`\` 3. Гарантируйте, что состояние бота явно сбрасывается или устанавливается корректно в начале каждой новой сессии взаимодействия. Это может потребовать явного вызова \`await state.reset_state()\` перед установкой нового состояния в \`cmd_start\` или в начале \`generate_bio\`. 4. Проверьте, что ваши состояния (\`Form.answer_name\`, \`Form.answer_birthday\` и т.д.) меняются корректно после каждого ответа и что логика перехода между состояниями правильно реализована. Одной из возможных причин, по которой ваш бот начинает с первого вопроса, является некорректное управление состояниями или логика извлечения/интерпретации \`last_question_idx\` из базы данных.

During the last decade, several global DEMs have been released based on satellite data. ASTER and SRTM are the most widely used DEMs, but the more recently released, AW3D30, TanDEM-X and MERIT, are being increasingly used. Many researchers have studied the quality of these DEM products in recent years. However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of their quality over areas with variable topography and land cover conditions. To provide this comparison, we examined the accuracy of six freely available global DEMs (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM) in four geographic regions with different topographic and land use conditions. We used local high-precision elevation models (Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Pleiades-1A) as reference models and all global models were resampled to reference model resolution (1m). In total, 608 million 1x1 m pixels were analyzed. To estimate the accuracy, we generated error rasters by subtracting each reference model from the corresponding global DEM and calculated descriptive statistics for this difference (e.g., median, mean, root-mean-square error (RMSE)). We also assessed the vertical accuracy as a function of the slope, slope aspect, and land cover. We found that slope had the strongest effect on DEM accuracy, with no relationship for slope aspect. The AW3D30 was the most robust and had the most stable performance in most of the tests and is therefore the best choice for an analysis of multiple geographic regions. SRTM and NASADEM also performed well where available, whereas NASADEM, as a successor of SRTM, showed only slight improvement in comparison to SRTM. MERIT and TanDEM-X also performed well despite their lower spatial resolution. Keywords: DEM; validation; accuracy assessment; slope; aspect; topography; land cover Graphical Abstract 1. Introduction Digital elevation models (DEMs) and the topographic and terrain variables derived from these models (e.g., slope aspect, slope, channels, hillslopes) are fundamental inputs for environmental and landscape modeling and spatial analysis [1,2,3,4,5], especially for research in geomorphology [6], hydrology [7], and geology [8]. For several decades, DEM products have been created at different spatial scales (e.g., global or national) mainly using remote sensing data [9]. As different remote sensing data and methods are employed during the development of DEMs, it has become increasingly important to assess the accuracy and performance of such products to provide insights into their limitations [10] and develop correction procedures [11,12]. The potential artifacts (errors) and inconsistencies identified in DEM products usually arise from distortions caused by atmospheric, terrain, and sensor conditions at the moment of the data acquisition [10,13,14]. Due to the potential analytical bias that results from artifacts and inconsistencies in DEMs, several studies have investigated the quality of such products, especially for those developed at a global scale. These investigations usually focused on the height (vertical) accuracy of the DEM [15,16] or the model’s performance in different applications, such as river network generation, the acquisition of geomorphological metrics, and flood simulation [12,17]. Most of the assessments compare freely available DEM products with GPS survey points [18] or with DEMs developed based on photogrammetric aerial images or on laser scanning (e.g., LiDAR) [19]. For instance, the vertical accuracy of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM; released in 2003) ranges from 2.18 to 21.70 m [10,20] and for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection satellite (ASTER, released in 2006), the accuracy ranges from 4.56 to 7.10 m [10,20]. These high-resolution global DEM products, developed based on radar data (SRTM) and data from optical sensors (ASTER), were one of the first freely available DEMs at a global scale. Recently, new freely available global-scale DEM products have been released, such as the TanDEM-X DEM [15], the Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM [21], the ALOS Global Digital Surface Model (AW3D30) [22], and the NASADEM [23]. Because these products are so new (TanDEM-X has been freely available since late 2018, MERIT 2017, AW3D30 and NASADEM since the beginning of 2020), fewer studies have evaluated their accuracy [24,25,26,27,28]. If their accuracy can be confirmed, these new DEM products, which are based on more current remote sensing data and better processing methods, will be highly valuable because of their ability to capture natural or man-made changes in the topography of terrestrial surfaces [29]. DEM products are continuously being improved, and new versions are being released constantly. Usually, the newest versions are developed by applying analytical improvements that reduce errors or inconsistencies identified in the previous DEM versions, especially based on assessment studies [9,30]. Many researchers have assessed the quality of the global-scale DEM products in recent years [26,28,30]. However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the quality of these freely available global DEMs over areas with variable topography and land cover conditions. The accuracy of the DEMs can largely vary depending on the latitude, vegetation, and topography. In addition, previous studies have only used a few hundred GPS points for ground control [30,31] or LiDAR-based DEM averaged to global DEM resolution [26] which results in a loss of information. In our study, we evaluated the performance of the freely available DEM products (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM) in four different regions of the world with different topography and land cover characteristics. We used locally derived LiDAR-based DEMs and the Pleiades 1A data as reference models to estimate the accuracy and resampled all the global models to the reference model resolution (1 m) which resulted in a total of 608 million 1x1 m pixels. This enabled us to perform the accuracy assessment at the highest possible resolution (1 m) and capture the continuous nature of topography. We estimated the vertical accuracy of the global DEM products as a function of slope, slope aspect, and land cover type. To the best of our knowledge, the accuracy of NASADEM has not been systematically estimated before against ground truth and in comparison with SRTM. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Areas Four study areas were chosen based on two main criteria: (1) the availability of a LiDAR or other high-precision reference model, and (2) the diversity of the land cover and relief, as these are the main factors known to influence DEM accuracy. We chose study areas where a reference model was freely available and where different topographic conditions (flat, hilly, and mountainous areas) coexisted with various land cover types (Figure 1). Remotesensing 12 03482 g001 550Figure 1. Locations of the four study areas, and images of their topography. The reference digital elevation models (DEMs) were obtained using local-scale Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys (Estonia, Norway, New Zealand) and Pleiades 1A images (China). 2.1.1. Estonia The Estonian study area is located in Southern Estonia, and covers 225 km2 (Figure 1). About 52% of the study area is covered by closed forest and about 17% is covered by open forest. About 28% of the study area is arable or otherwise cultivated land. The study area includes the small village of Puka, with 565 inhabitants, and several smaller villages. The elevation ranges from 40 to 218 m according to the LiDAR-based reference model (see Section 2.3.1.), and the topography is relatively flat, with some hilly landscapes in the eastern part of the study area (Figure 1). 2.1.2. China The Chinese study area is located in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region (south of Mongolia). The area is bounded by the Helan Mountains and has tectonic faults that resulted in a diverse relief (Figure 1). In the 103 km2 total area, 52% is covered by open land or sparse vegetation, 24% is covered by artificial landscapes (e.g., residential and industrial areas), and 20% by grasslands. The area’s elevation ranges from 1063 to 1766 m (Figure 1). 2.1.3. New Zealand The study area covers 111 km2 and is located in the southern part of North Island of New Zealand in the administrative districts of Lower Hutt City, Upper Hutt City, and South Wairarapa. The dominant land cover types are dense evergreen forests. The other land cover types are grasslands, open forest, shrubs, and arable land. The region’s relief is characterized by mountains and gorges, with elevation ranging from 32 to 828 m. 2.1.4. Norway The Norwegian study area lies between Jotunheimen and Rondane mountainous areas, and covers 193 km2. It is located in the Froni municipality within Innlandet County. The elevation ranges from 335 to 1662 m, but it is relatively flat and does not have many steep slopes. The Vinstra river crosses the study area. Approximately 44% of the study area is covered by forests, 37% by grasslands and 12% by open forest. Water bodies, arable land, and wetlands cover the rest of the area. The SRTM and NASADEM were not available for this study area because it is located above 60°N latitude. Therefore, we only analyzed the ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, and TanDEM-X DEMs to test the accuracy of these alternative global DEMs for a region where SRTM and NASADEM data are not available. 2.2. The Studied DEMs Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the DEMs used in the present study. Table 1. Summary of the global digital elevation models (DEMs) evaluated in the present study. Table 2.2.1. ASTER The ASTER Global DEM (GDEM) version 2 (v2) was created photogrammetrically from a compilation of cloud-free ASTER stereopair images [32,33]. The sensor is carried aboard the Terra satellite and the images stereopairs were acquired by nadir- and after-looking angles in the near-infrared band [30,34]. A major advantage of the along-track mode of data acquisition (as compared to cross-track acquisition) is that the images that form the stereopairs are acquired a few seconds apart (rather than days) under uniform environmental and lighting conditions [34]. The ASTER GDEM2 was released in 2011 and showed improvements compared with the first version, such as better georeferencing, inclusion of more scenes acquired between 2008 and 2011, and a smaller correlation kernel, and has higher spatial resolution [33]. However, ASTER GDEM2 is known to have anomalies and artifacts that limit its usefulness [9,35]. Previous studies have found that ASTER GDEM2 performs well over bare areas but is less accurate over areas with a high forest cover [30,36]. 2.2.2. AW3D30 The ALOSWorld3D 30 m DEM (AW3D30; version 3.1) was developed based on millions of images acquired by panchromatic optical sensor (PRISM) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) [22]. The stereoscopic images were acquired along-track at nadir, backward and forward views and with 2.5 m of spatial resolution [37]. The first version of AW3D30 was published in 2016 and since then the dataset has been updated to improve the absolute/relative height accuracies with additional calibrations and void filling [22]. The latest version was released in April 2020, which was also used in the current study. Although, the accuracy estimation of the AW3D DEM is available only for the 5 m-resolution commercial version (root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5 m), studies that have compared different DEM products have shown good accuracy for AW3D30 [38,39]. 2.2.3. MERIT The MERIT DEM was created to provide an error-reduced DEM product. The DEM was developed by combining data acquired from SRTM with data from the ALOS World 3D data with 30 m resolution (AW3D-30m v1), and used error-removal techniques that reduced the bias and other sources of noise [21]. The reported accuracy is ±12 m (90th percentile of the error range) [21]. Studies suggested that the reduced-error DEM performed well [12,28], but that artifacts remain in the DEM product [40]. 2.2.4. TanDEM-X DEM The TanDEM-X DEM was developed based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images acquired by X-band radar and full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar sensors on two satellites (TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X) [15,41]. The sensors imaged the Earth’s surface at least twice between 2010 and 2015, and additional images were acquired for areas with complex topography, such as mountain regions. The sensors aboard the satellites orbited the Earth in a twin formation with long track distances ranging from 300 to 500 m, thereby supporting both across-track and along-track interferometry [42]. This approach supported the development of a DEM with high accuracy. The TanDEM-X DEM product with a spatial resolution of 12 m that was released in September 2016 is reported to have a horizontal and vertical absolute accuracy of <10 m, and a relative vertical accuracy of 2 m for slopes ≤11° and 4 m for slopes >11° [43]. As the DEM with 12 m resolution is only available upon approval of a scientific proposal and requires payment of a processing fee, we instead used the completely free TandDEM-X DEM global product (Version 1.0) with 90 m spatial resolution that was released in late 2018 [26]. The quality of the interferometric SAR (InSAR) DEMs are known to be affected by the particular land cover and terrain characteristics of the area under illumination and the specific acquisition geometry used for the data take [15]. SAR acquisitions over complex terrain are often affected by geometric distortions (including foreshortening, layover, and shadow) [15,44], and the X-band signal can partially penetrate vegetation [26] and volume scattering, creating some uncertainty in the height estimation. 2.2.5. SRTM The SRTM DEM was developed based on the images acquired by two synthetic aperture radars aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour [45,46]. The shuttle flew and mapped continental areas between 60°N and 60°S for 11 days in February 2000. One of the sensors, which used a C-band radar system, was responsible for contiguous mapping coverage, while the other sensor, which used an X-band system, was responsible for generating data along discrete 50-km-wide swaths [45]. The SRTM DEM that we used, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, was developed based on the C-band radar interferometry data and has a reported accuracy of ±16 m [47]. However, the vertical accuracy has also been reported to be <9 m [48] and to be 4.31 m (±14.09 m) in mountain regions [49]. SRTM is known to suffer from voids due to shadow-casting [50]. The accuracy of SRTM is known to suffer from the similar InSAR methodology-related issues as TanDEM-X (see Section 2.2.4). In our study, we used the void-filled SRTM DEM version 3 (SRTMV3) dataset that was released in 2014 [50]. 2.2.6. NASADEM The NASADEM (released in February 2020) was created by reprocessing of the SRTM radar data, and merging it with other DEM datasets, such as ASTER, ICESat and GLAS. The main objective was to eliminate voids and other limitations that were present in the SRTM dataset [23]. The NASADEM is supposed to be the successor of the SRTM DEM dataset [51]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on the accuracy of the NASADEM dataset. 2.3. Reference Models 2.3.1. LiDAR DEMs We used DEM products derived based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data as reference models for the study areas in Estonia, Norway, and New Zealand (China is described in the next section). LiDAR-based DEMs have good accuracy [57], but LiDAR technology cannot penetrate a dense vegetation canopy and the datasets do not cover large areas [32]. For the Estonian study area, we downloaded the DEM from the Estonian Land Board’s Geoportal [58]. The reported vertical accuracy by the Estonian Land Board is 9 to 14 cm. The reference DEM for the Norwegian study area was acquired from Høydedata portal [59] and the reported vertical accuracy is 3 to 12 cm. The New Zealand reference DEM was downloaded from Linz Data Service [60]. The reported vertical accuracy of the New Zealand reference DEM is 10 to 15 cm. All reference DEMs had a 1 m horizontal resolution. 2.3.2. Pleiades-1A DEM For the Chinese study area, we used the Pleiades-1A DEM because LiDAR data were not available. The Pleiades-1A DEM for the Chinese study area was developed using five image stereopairs acquired by the satellites of the Pleiades mission on 23 April, 17 July, 24 July, and 25 July of 2014 [61]. These images were processed using the photogrammetry module of the ERDAS IMAGINE software. The final DEM was acquired by averaging the point cloud from the image stereopairs within 1 m pixels using continuous-curvature splines in tension and a tension factor of 0.75 [61]. The data were downloaded from OpenTopography portal [62]. No estimated vertical accuracy was provided for the current DEM product, but studies that used similar approaches have reported accuracies from 30 cm [63] to 0.5 m [64]. 2.4. Pre-processing All the datasets had different spatial resolution and different horizontal and vertical reference systems. All global DEMs (except TanDEM-X) originally represented orthometric heights from the EGM96 geoid. However, all of the reference DEMs used different geoids. To make all the study areas comparable, we (1) projected all the datasets to the WGS84 coordinate system; and (2) transferred all DEMs to the EGM96 geoid by subtracting the difference between the local geoid and the EGM96 geoid from the reference DEM values. The elevation values for the TanDEM-X DEM represent ellipsoidal heights, so to convert them to orthometric heights, we subtracted the EMG96 height from the TanDEM-X DEM. All geoid models (except EST-GEOID2017) were downloaded in GeoTIFF format from Agisoft Geoids [65]. EST-GEOID2017 [66] was obtained in ASCII format from the Estonian Land Board. Previous studies have resampled reference models to the global DEM resolution, but this loses information. Therefore, we resampled all global DEMs using the nearest neighbor method and aligned the results spatially to the reference model’s spatial resolution (1 m). Pre-processing was performed in ArcGIS 10.6 [67]. 2.5. Accuracy Assessment All global elevation models are, strictly speaking, digital surface models (DSMs) [30,32,68]. However, in most applications, they are treated as being equivalent to DEMs [69,70], so for simplicity, we will use the term “DEM” in the rest of this paper. To assess the vertical accuracy of the global DEMs, we created the error rasters on a cell-by-cell basis by subtracting the reference model’s value from the corresponding value in each global DEM: Δℎ=𝑍model−𝑍ref (1)where ∆h is the height difference (error) between the global and reference DEM, which was defined as the error term, Zmodel is the height in the global DEM, and Zref is the height in the reference DEM. We used the map algebra module in ArcGIS 10.6 to generate the error rasters. To analyze the effect of vegetation on the accuracy of the elevation models, we used the global 100 m-resolution vegetation cover data for the year 2015 from the Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers—Collection 2, which can be freely downloaded from the Copernicus site [71]. The data collection for the global DEMs took place from 2000 to 2017. We initially chose the study areas in relatively remote areas with small land cover change. In addition, to consider the land cover changes, we firstly performed visual check of historical changes based on Google Earth images and CCI long-term global land cover time series (300 m resolution). We identified that the land cover has not changed significantly over the last 10 years. To better align the land cover dataset for the year 2000 (SRTM and NASADEM), we used the Global Forest Change forest cover dataset [72] and added all the forests to the 2015 year land cover to ensure that bare areas are not overestimated in the land cover. Only the Estonian study area had noticeable changes in the forest cover from 2000 to 2015. The NZ and Norwegian study areas remained practically unchanged, and the Chinese study are had no forest. The original 21 land cover classes (Supplementary S1) were generalized and reclassified into 10 classes (Table 2). To separate the effect of slope from the effect of land cover, we only used slopes of less than 15° in the land cover analysis. Table 2. Slope, slope aspect, and land cover classes used in the study. Table To analyze the effect of slope and aspect on the accuracy of the DEM, we derived slope and aspect from the reference model DEM (LiDAR or Pleiades-1A). Slope was reclassified into 8 classes (Table 2). Gdulová et al. [24] reported that the relationship between the DEM accuracy and terrain aspect is stronger for greater slopes. Therefore, we extracted slopes steeper than 15° (slope classes 4 to 8 in Table 2) to estimate the effect of aspect on the DEM accuracy. In addition, to eliminate the effect of dense vegetation on the aspect analysis, we only used land cover classes 4, 5, and 7 (classes 9 and 10 were not present on slopes steeper than 15°) in the aspect analysis. We also reclassified aspect from 0° to 360° into 8 cardinal directions (Table 2). In addition, we calculated roughness for all the study areas because we assumed that higher roughness (variability or irregularity in elevation) results in lower DEM accuracy. We performed correlation analysis which revealed that roughness was highly correlated with slope (0.92 < r2 < 0.98). Therefore, roughness would not have explained the significant amount of additional variation in the errors, and for this reason we did not include it in the further study. We further analyzed the error rasters together with the land cover, slope, and aspect rasters using Python function libraries. We used the Python rasterio and pandas libraries [73] to transform all the raster data into dataframes in which all spatially aligned error cells were joined with the respective land cover, slope, and aspect class. For every error raster, we generated a histogram of the errors (Supplementary S2). The histograms let us estimate the error distribution and detect any deviations from a normal distribution. We calculated error metrics across all study areas and also as a function of the land cover, slope, and aspect classes. We used the following error statistics suggested by Höhle and Höhle [74]: the mean error (ME), median error (MedE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and standard deviation (STD). Several DEMs did not have a normal error distribution (Supplementary S1) and we therefore also calculated more robust accuracy measures suited for non-normal error distributions [74]: the normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) and the 25% and 75% quantiles. We used the Python NumPy library [75] to calculate the error metrics. In addition, we generated boxplots to visualize the errors. The Python scripts used for these calculations are available in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/LandscapeGeoinformatics/globalDEM_accuracy. 3. Results 3.1. Overall Vertical Accuracy For all study areas and elevation models, except for a few cases in ASTER and TanDEM-X, ME and MedE were positive (Table 3, Figure 2). That is, all the global models generally overestimated the elevation compared to the reference models, which was expected. From the spatial distribution of the errors, it is clear that forested areas had strong positive errors compared to the reference models (Figure 1 and Figure 3). However, in the cases of the Estonian, New Zealand, and Norwegian study areas, ASTER had a negative ME and MedE. The negative errors were spatially occurring in areas with low vegetation cover (Figure 3). The accuracy of AW3D30 was the most stable based on RMSE and STD across the study areas and in most cases also performed the best; however, it slightly overestimated the elevation in all four study areas (Figure 3). Of the six global models, ASTER and in most cases also MERIT performed the worst based on RMSE. Moreover, MERIT showed the largest variation in error values (NMAD between 2.11 and 10.41 m) (Table 3, Figure 2). Of the four study areas, the biggest variation in errors (STD) was observed in New Zealand, where the relief was the most rugged and was combined with tall and dense vegetation (Table 3, Figure 2).

Effect of Slope and Aspect on Accuracy There was a clear effect of slope on the vertical accuracy of the DEMs (Figure 4, Supplementary S3a–d) in the Chinese, New Zealand, and Norwegian study areas. The Estonian study area showed no slope effect because most of the study area is flat and 95% of the pixels had a slope less than 10° (Supplementary S4). The effect of slope on accuracy was smallest for the AW3D30, SRTM, and NASADEM. The ASTER, MERIT, and TanDEM-X DEMs exhibited similarly strong effects of slope on their accuracy; with increasing slope, the RMSE and variation of the error (STD) increased (Figure 4, Supplementary S3a–d). MedE showed slightly different behavior among the DEMs. MedE did not have clear increasing nor decreasing pattern for ASTER. For all the other DEMs, MedE in general increased, except for the Chinese study area. Remotesensing 12 03482 g004 550Figure 4.

The effect of aspect on accuracy was strongest for the ASTER model; however, there was no clear pattern across study areas (Figure 5). In the Norwegian study area, the E and SE slopes had MedE values of 6.04 and 3.24 m, respectively, whereas the opposing W and NW slopes had MedE values of −7.47 and −6.48 m, respectively. We observed a similar pattern for the New Zealand study area, where E, SE, and S slopes had contrasting MedE values to the opposite W, NW, and N slopes, respectively. However, the Estonian and Chinese study areas did not show similar patterns. Remotesensing 12 03482 g005 550Figure 5.

The central horizontal line in the box marks the median; the boxes show the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile), and the whiskers show 1.5 times the interquartile range. The MERIT model also showed high variation in errors (STD) for all aspects and all study areas except Estonia. However, there was no clear dependency on aspect. The errors in the AW3D30 model had the smallest variation but showed no strong dependency on aspect. In the case of New Zealand and Chinese study areas, AW3D30 even exhibited contrasting patterns. SRTM and NASADEM also showed relatively low variation. For the SRTM and NASADEM, the E and SE slopes had the poorest accuracy (high MedE) among the study areas and NW slopes had the highest accuracy (low MedE) (Figure 5, Supplementary S5a–c). TanDEM-X did not show any dependency on aspect. 3.3. Effect of Land Cover on Accuracy We found that all DEMs had systematically higher elevations than the actual land surface in forested areas in land cover classes 1 and 2 (Figure 6, Supplementary S6a–c). MedE was consistently positive for all the DEMs, except for the ASTER model in the Estonian study area, and RMSE ranged from 3.54 to 13.66 m for the closed forest and 2.82 to 10.5 m for the open forest across study areas. We observed the highest errors and variation (STD) for forested areas in the New Zealand study area. From all six global models, the AW3D30 was the most accurate over the forested areas across all study areas. Remotesensing 12 03482 g006 550Figure 6. Box plots of errors by land cover class for all global digital elevation models for the four study areas. SRTM and NASADEM data were not available for the Norwegian study area because of its high latitude. Land cover classes: 1, Closed forest; 2, Open forest; 3, Shrubs; 4, Herbaceous vegetation; 5, Cultivated area; 6, Urban / built up area; 7, Bare land / sparse vegetation; 8, Wetland; 9, Snow and ice; 10, Water. Only existing land cover classes are plotted for each study area. The DEMs were generally more accurate for the herbaceous and cultivated areas (land cover classes 4 and 5) than for the forested areas (Figure 6, Supplementary S6a–d). In most cases, the global models slightly overestimated (positive MedE) the elevation over the herbaceous and cultivated areas. The RMSE was less than 5 m in most cases, except for the ASTER DEM, for which the RMSE was mostly greater than 5 m and often greater than 10 m. The ASTER DEM also often underestimated the elevation for herbaceous and cultivated areas. There was no single best performing DEM over the herbaceous and cultivated areas. Some DEMs that showed high accuracy in some study areas did not have good accuracy in some others (e.g., MERIT). However, AW3D30 showed most consistent and in most cases also the best accuracy across all study areas. The magnitude of the error for the urban and built-up areas (land cover class 6) was similar to the values for herbaceous and cultivated areas. For urban and built-up areas, the MedE values were −5.56 to 4.39 m, which was similar to the values for herbaceous and cultivated areas. All DEMs, except for TanDEM-X, strongly overestimated the elevation over water (land cover class 10) in the Chinese study area (Supplementary S6b). 4. Discussion 4.1. Overall Accuracy AW3D30 provided the most robust and accurate DEM for all regions, which aligns with previous studies that found that the vertical RMSE was below 5m in flat areas [16,76] and rises up to 12 or to 14 m in areas with more complex relief [76]. The next-best DEMs were SRTM and NASADEM. For the SRTM, previous studies reported a vertical accuracy (RMSE) of 5 m [30] using GPS ground-control points, and 14.9 m (RMSE) by using LiDAR as the reference model [32]. Our results agree with these previous studies, as we found the overall RMSE to be 6.59, 10.00, and 13.07 m in the Estonian, Chinese, and New Zealand study areas, respectively. The recently released NASADEM, which is supposed to be the successor for the SRTM, showed only slightly better accuracy with the overall RMSE found to be 6.39, 8.53, and 12.08 m in the Estonian, Chinese, and New Zealand study areas, respectively. For the MERIT model, we found an overall accuracy (RMSE) of 3.01, 12.43, 13.58, and 10.49 m for the Estonian, Chinese, New Zealand, and Norwegian study areas, respectively. For the TanDEM-X DEM, overall RMSE was 7.16, 11.10, 15.05, and 6.84 m for the Estonian, Chinese, New Zealand, and Norwegian study areas, respectively. These fall within the expected accuracy range in previous research: 12 m for MERIT [21] and 10 m for TanDEM-X [15]. However, some studies have identified better accuracies. For example, Hawker et al. [26] estimated the RMSE to be 2.32 and 3.10 m for MERIT and TanDEM-X, respectively. Our error estimates are probably higher because of the more complex terrain in our study areas; however, in the flat Estonian study area, our results are similar to these previous results. MERIT and TanDEM-X are more sensitive than SRTM to relief, mainly due to the lower spatial resolution; this leads to intra-pixel variation, which is exacerbated on steep slopes. ASTER performed the worst of the models in all study areas (RMSE 9.22 to 13.52 m). It also had the highest uncertainty (high STD) across study areas for a range of topographic conditions and land cover types. Several studies have found similar accuracy for ASTER [32,33]. The ASTER DEM also includes artifacts that are likely due to cloud cover, mismatches between different scenes, and processing techniques which is its major shortcoming [9,30]. 4.2. Effect of Slope and Aspect on Accuracy The slope had the strongest effect on the accuracy of the global DEMs. For all six global DEMs, the uncertainty increased with the increasing slope. The ASTER, MERIT and TanDEM-X were the most affected by slope. The RMSE rose from between 8.25 and 10.62 m on slopes <5° to between 10.25 and 23.35 m on slopes >35° for ASTER; from between 2.83 and 7.25 m on slopes <5° to between 4.67 and 26.85 m on slopes >35° for MERIT; from between 3.27 and 8.06 m on slopes <5° to between 8.12 and 19.23 m on slopes >35° for TanDEM-X (Supplementary S3a–d). This agrees well with previous studies [24,26,77,78]. We resampled all the global DEMs to agree with the reference model resolution (1 m), which results in higher intra-pixel variation on steeper slopes. This effect can be clearly seen in the error map for the New Zealand study area (Figure 3), which had the most complex topography and where intra-pixel variation is clearly visible for the lower-resolution MERIT and TanDEM-X DEMs. The accuracy of the AW3D30, SRTM and NASADEM models was the least affected by slope and their variation in error did not increase so much as compared to ASTER, MERIT and TanDEM-X. ASTER showed the biggest variation in errors (STD) and AW3D30 showed the smallest variation due to aspect, but no clear dependency on aspect. The high variation of the errors and the overall random response to aspect is likely caused by artifacts in the ASTER model. The visual inspection of numerous artifacts in the ASTER model (Figure 3) and the high variation in errors across the study areas demonstrated the model’s lower quality, which was previously described by Purinton and Bookhagen [10]. For the SRTM and NASADEM, we observed a small systematic dependency on aspect in which opposite directions (e.g., NW and SE) had contrasting accuracy. This was observed previously by Szabó et al. [79] and Gorokhovich and Voustianiouk [80]. They related this dependency to the orbit of Space Shuttle Endeavour, which was perpendicular to the NE–SW line. The quality of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images depends upon the view direction. In the view direction, inclined terrain causes foreshortening or even layover (i.e., when the beam encounters the top of an object before it encounters the base) [81]. Previous studies have identified similar issues for the TanDEM-X DEM. Gdulová et al. [24] observed the poorest accuracy for east-facing slopes; this resulted from the presence of areas with data acquisition only from an ascending orbit. However, our study did not identify this pattern. East-facing slopes only exhibited higher errors in Norwegian study area, and this was also observed for the MERIT and ASTER DEMs. The highest errors occurred on the steep banks of the Vinstra river valley, which is mostly oriented from NE to SW (Figure 3). 4.3. Effect of Land Cover on the Accuracy In general, the magnitude of the error for the different land cover types differed more among study areas than among the different DEMs. This indicates that the land cover affects a DEM’s accuracy in ways that are location-specific. Even for a given land cover type, the vegetation characteristics (density, height) vary enough among biomes that the variation causes significant variation in the errors of the DEMs. For SAR-based DEMs (TanDEM-X, SRTM, NASADEM), volume scattering causes uncertainty [79]. In the case of volume scattering in a forest, leaves reflect radar signals which then hit more leaves and branches, and multiple scattering occurs until the signals exit the vegetation. A percentage of the incoming radar is therefore volumetrically scattered back to the SAR sensor, giving the vegetation a brighter signature. However, if the forest height is homogeneous, then the forest surface will still mimic the underlying topography. Forested areas caused a positive bias (i.e., overestimation of the true elevation) in all global DEMs and all study areas. Elevation estimation in forested areas performed most poorly in the New Zealand study area, which is mostly covered by indigenous forests: Nothofagus spp. (beech), broadleaved angiosperm trees, Agathis australis (kauri), and other conifers (predominantly podocarps) form a tall and dense canopy [82]. This canopy may explain the larger positive bias in the New Zealand study area than in the other study areas. Urban areas produced elevation estimates that were 2 to 5 m higher than the reference model, which was less than the error magnitude we expected. For example, González-Moradas and Viveen [30] found that buildings severely affected the performance of ASTER. As only the Estonian and Chinese study areas (Supplementary S4) had urban areas in flat areas and most of the urban areas were dominated by low buildings or roads, this explains the generally good performance of the global models in the urban parts of these study areas. The ASTER, MERIT, and SRTM DEMs overestimated the elevation over bodies of water. For the SRTM and MERIT DEMs, this is likely caused by how SAR interferometry functions, since low coherence or low backscatter increases the noise over water [15]. Although SRTM v3 voids have been filled by using the ASTER DEM to improve the SRTM DEM’s water mask [50], ASTER strongly overestimated elevations above bodies of water in the Chinese study area (Figure 3), because small bodies of water were not depicted in the ASTER water mask [83]. Therefore, the SRTM correction was not successful in the Chinese study area. Interestingly, TanDEM-X is also based on interferometry, but did not exhibit large errors over the bodies of water, probably because of having a higher quality water mask. In principle, all the global DEMs we analyzed can be considered DSMs. This also explains their tendency to overestimate elevation over vegetated areas because the surface that reflects the signal (e.g., a tree canopy rather than the forest floor) exists at some height above the true ground level. However, in case of SAR-based elevation models, there exist some exceptions for areas where the SAR signal penetrates the surface by some meters—e.g., in cases of ice, snow or vegetation [84,85]. It has been shown that for ice and snow, up to 7 m underestimation can take place [86]. In case of forested areas, the overestimation will still happen because the forest height usually exceeds the penetration. However, for MERIT, an approximate vegetation correction has been applied for vegetation but with no comparable correction for buildings [70]. As a result, MERIT exhibited slightly better performance over densely forested areas than the other models. 4.4. Effect of Spatial Resolution The ASTER, AW3D30, SRTM, and NASADEM had 30 m spatial resolution, but MERIT and TanDEM-X had only 90 m spatial resolution. Despite its higher resolution, ASTER performed worse than MERIT and TanDEM-X. However, in rugged terrain such as the New Zealand study area, we observed high variation of errors and a higher RMSE that can probably be explained by the low spatial resolution, which causes high error variation due to the DEM’s inability to capture variation within the large pixels. Elevation can change significantly on steep slopes within a horizontal distance of 90 m. The elevation estimates around the center of the pixel are likely to be correct, but upslope values are likely to be underestimated and downslope values to be overestimated. This was most apparent for the New Zealand study area (Figure 3). However, Hawker et al. [26] demonstrated that on floodplains, the 90 m TanDEM-X DEM performed better than the 30 m SRTM DEM and similarly to the 90 m MERIT DEM. For geomorphological mapping, high-resolution (12 m) TanDEM-X has been found to yield a detailed and widely consistent landscape representation, and most major landforms can also be easily allocated in the SRTM; however, ASTER does not allow identification of microscale landforms because of the high number of artifacts [87]. González-Moradas and Viveen [30] found that the 12 m resolution TanDEM-X DEM displayed the most accurate elevation values but that the 30 m SRTM DEM also performed well in terms of hydrological applications compared to other 30 m DEMs. 4.5. Limitations of Our Study One of the limitations of our study was the land cover dataset. To ensure the consistency across all study areas, we used the Copernicus Global Land Cover dataset, with 100 m resolution, which is lower than the resolution of the analyzed DEMs. The coarser spatial resolution might have created errors in land cover classification at the edges of land cover types, where closed forest might have been classified as open forest and vice versa, causing incorrect attribution of errors to some of the land cover types. Another issue is the temporal change of land cover. The global DEM data were collected from 2000 to 2017 and land cover can change significantly. However, our study areas were in remote regions with minimal land cover change and for the year 2000, we used the high-resolution Global Forest Canopy Height dataset [88] to update the 2015 year land cover dataset to ensure that forested areas are the most accurate. In addition, seasonal differences (leaves on–off, dry–wet) affect the collection of the SAR based elevation data because these factors may either increase or decrease the backscatter [89]. Dry conditions usually increase the penetration. The SRTM data are collected in February when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and most of the trees have no leaves, which should increase the penetration. However, evergreen forests still have leaves all year round and are harder to penetrate and the timing of the wet and dry seasons vary across the world. Several studies have attempted to develop methods to improve the accuracy of global DEMs by data fusion. For example, Yue et al. [90] combined SRTM-1, ASTER GDEM v2, and ICESat laser altimetry data by using ASTER GDEM v2 data as the elevation source for the SRTM void filling and the ICESat GLAS data to increase the accuracy of the ASTER data within the void regions by applying an artificial neural network model. Su et al. [91] developed a regression model based on tree height, canopy cover, and terrain slope to correct the SRTM DEM data in vegetated mountain areas. However, they noted that the limited availability of small-footprint LiDAR data may make it difficult to perform large-scale correction for the SRTM DEM. The recently released NASADEM, which is the updated version of SRTM, was improved by using the new unwrapping strategy [92] to reduce voids, and applying vertical and tilt adjustments based on ground control points derived from the ICESat laser altimeter to improve the elevation estimation over forested areas and snow/ice [23]. The NASADEM development team has also evaluated the extent to which ASTER GDEM3 with cloud removal can be used outside the SRTM latitude range to extend the NASADEM to polar areas [23]. However, based on our study and previous research, AW3D30 would be much more promising. Many studies covered large and geographically diverse regions, and the main reason for using freely available global DEMs is that no high-quality local DEM is available. Moreover, it is unlikely that these regions have high-quality field data over large regions that can be used to improve the global DEM. However, some new global-level datasets, such as Global Forest Change forest height dataset [88], would be promising to apply vegetation correction to NASADEM. Our results show that currently, the most accurate freely available DEM is AW3D30. However, higher-quality commercial products, for example, global TanDEM-X 12m-resolution DEM, have shown higher elevation accuracy [15,31]. 5. Conclusions The accuracy of the global DEMs depended greatly on the unique characteristics of each region. The ASTER model was the least accurate and had the highest uncertainty across all study areas, topographic conditions, and land cover types. AW3D30 showed the smallest uncertainty and highest accuracy across all study areas. However, NASADEM also showed very similar accuracy but it does not cover the northernmost latitudes. MERIT and TanDEM-X performed well despite their lower spatial resolution, and as they also cover higher latitudes. We found slope to be the most important factor affecting DEM accuracy. The smallest bias in the elevation values was detected on flat areas (slope <5°), and the bias increased with increasing slope, thereby increasing variation of the errors. Aspect did not systematically affect DEM performance, which agrees with previous studies. Densely forested areas caused height overestimation by all DEMs. However, MERIT was slightly less affected by the forested areas, mainly due to the vegetation removal procedure. Other DEMs could benefit from similar vegetation correction by employing the new Global Forest Canopy Height dataset.

With advancements in satellite data, several global DEMs such as ASTER, SRTM, AW3D30, TanDEM-X, MERIT, and NASADEM have become available for free. These DEMs are essential for applications in geomorphology, hydrology, and geology, among others. The accuracy of DEMs is vital for their application, and while many studies have evaluated individual DEM products, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation across different topographic and land cover conditions was missing. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the accuracy of six freely available global DEMs across four distinct geographic regions with varying topography and land use. # Methodology The study utilized high-precision local elevation models, such as LiDAR and Pleiades-1A data, as reference models to assess the accuracy of the global DEMs. A total of 608 million 1x1 m pixels were analyzed to estimate vertical accuracy based on error rasters generated from the differences between the global DEMs and the reference models. The study also examined the impact of slope, slope aspect, and land cover on DEM accuracy. # Results The study found significant variations in the vertical accuracy of the global DEMs across different regions and conditions. Among the DEMs evaluated, AW3D30 emerged as the most robust and consistently accurate model across most tests, making it the preferred choice for analysis across multiple geographic regions. SRTM and NASADEM also demonstrated good performance, with NASADEM showing slight improvement over its predecessor, SRTM. DEMs like MERIT and TanDEM-X also performed well, despite their lower spatial resolution. Slope was identified as the primary factor influencing DEM accuracy, with a more pronounced impact on models with lower spatial resolution. The study did not find a consistent relationship between DEM accuracy and slope aspect. As expected, densely forested areas posed challenges for all DEMs, resulting in elevation overestimations. However, MERIT's performance indicated slight improvements possibly due to its vegetation correction procedures. # Conclusion The comprehensive assessment of freely available global DEMs highlights the importance of accounting for regional variations in topography and land cover when choosing a DEM for research applications. AW3D30's robustness across diverse conditions positions it as a versatile choice for global analyses. However, the specific choice of a DEM should consider the particular needs of the research project, including the scale of analysis and the geographic region of interest. Future improvements in DEM accuracy will likely depend on advancements in remote sensing technology and methodologies for correcting elevation data, particularly in challenging areas like densely forested regions."},{"prompt":"нужно перевести на русский","completion":"**Вертикальная Точность Бесплатно Доступных Глобальных Цифровых Моделей Высот: Обширное Исследование** # Введение Цифровые Модели Высот (ЦМВ) играют ключевую роль в различных областях исследований, предоставляя основные сведения о топографических и рельефных переменных поверхности Земли. Благодаря достижениям в области спутниковых данных, несколько глобальных ЦМВ, таких как ASTER, SRTM, AW3D30, TanDEM-X, MERIT и NASADEM, стали доступны бесплатно. Эти ЦМВ жизненно важны для применения в области геоморфологии, гидрологии и геологии, среди прочего. Точность ЦМВ критична для их применения, и хотя многие исследования оценивали отдельные продукты ЦМВ, обширная и систематическая оценка в различных топографических и ландшафтных условиях отсутствовала. Это исследование заполняет этот пробел, анализируя точность шести бесплатно доступных глобальных ЦМВ в четырех различных географических регионах с разнообразной топографией и использованием земли. # Методология В исследовании использовались высокоточные локальные модели высот, такие как ЛиДАР и данные Pleiades-1A, в качестве эталонных моделей для оценки точности глобальных ЦМВ. Было проанализировано 608 миллионов пикселей размером 1х1 м для оценки вертикальной точности на основе растров ошибок, созданных из различий между глобальными ЦМВ и эталонными моделями. Исследование также исследовало влияние угла наклона, аспекта наклона и типа ландшафтного покрытия на точность ЦМВ. # Результаты Исследование обнаружило значительные вариации в вертикальной точности глобальных ЦМВ в различных регионах и условиях. Среди оцененных ЦМВ, AW3D30 выявился как наиболее надёжная и последовательно точная модель в большинстве тестов, делая её предпочтительным выбором для анализа в различных географических регионах. SRTM и NASADEM также продемонстрировали хорошую производительность, при этом NASADEM показал незначительное улучшение по сравнению с его предшественником, SRTM. ЦМВ, такие как MERIT и TanDEM-X, также показали хорошие результаты, несмотря на их меньшее пространственное разрешение. Было установлено, что угол наклона оказывает наибольшее влияние на точность ЦМВ, с более заметным влиянием на модели с меньшим пространственным разрешением. Исследование не обнаружило последовательной связи между точностью ЦМВ и аспектом наклона. Как и ожидалось, плотно лесистые районы представляли вызовы для всех ЦМВ, в результате чего высота была переоценена. Однако, производительность MERIT указывала на незначительные улучшения, возможно, благодаря его процедурам коррекции растительности. # Заключение Обширная оценка бесплатно доступных глобальных ЦМВ подчёркивает важность учёта региональных вариаций в топографии и ландшафтном покрытии при выборе ЦМВ для исследовательских приложений. Надежность AW3D30 в разнообразных условиях определяет её как универсальный выбор для глобальных анализов. Однако конкретный выбор ЦМВ должен учитывать конкретные потребности исследовательского проекта, включая масштаб анализа и географический регион интереса. Будущее улучшение точности ЦМВ, вероятно, будет зависеть от достижений в области дистанционного зондирования и методологий коррекции данных высоты, особенно в сложных районах, таких как плотно лесистые области."},{"prompt":"Как дела?","completion":"Всё отлично, спасибо за интерес!

Specifiche per l’implementazione Nella realizzazione del progetto devono essere utilizzate molte delle tecnologie illustrate durante il corso. In particolare: ● gli utenti interagiscono con HOTELIER mediante un client che utilizza un'interfaccia a linea di comando. E’ facoltativa l’implementazione di un'interfaccia grafica. ● fase di registrazione ○ (studenti nuovo ordinamento): questa fase viene implementata instaurando una connessione TCP con il server ○ (solo studenti vecchio ordinamento) questa fase viene implementata mediante RMI ● Fase di login: deve essere effettuata come prima operazione, dopo che è stata effettuata la registrazione, usando una connessione TCP instaurata con il server. Il login è necessario nel caso si voglia publicare una recensione o vedere il proprio distintivo. ○ (solo studenti vecchio ordinamento) In seguito alla login il client si registra a un servizio di notifica del server per ricevere aggiornamenti su alcuni ranking di suo interesse. Il servizio di notifica deve essere implementato con il meccanismo di RMI callback. Il client mantiene una struttura dati per tenere traccia dei ranking modificati, che è aggiornata in seguito alla ricezione della callback. ● Dopo la login effettuata con successo, l’utente interagisce, secondo il modello client-server (richieste/risposte), con il server sulla connessione TCP persistente creata, inviando uno dei comandi elencati nella sezione 2.1. Tutte le operazioni sono richieste su questa connessione TCP. ● quando il server ricalcola i ranking locali, verifica se c’è un cambiamento nella prima posizione e, in questo caso, invia il nome del nuovo albergo che occupa la prima posizione e della città in cui si trova, a tutti gli utenti loggati.

Ogni quanto dovrei fare un aggiornamento secondo te?","completion":"La frequenza di aggiornamento dei ranking in un sistema come quello descritto dipende fortemente dalle specifiche necessità del servizio e dalle aspettative degli utenti. Tuttavia, ci sono alcuni fattori chiave che puoi considerare per determinare un intervallo di aggiornamento ottimale: 1. **Volume di nuove recensioni**: Se il tuo sistema riceve una grande quantità di nuove recensioni frequentemente, potresti dover aggiornare i ranking più spesso per garantire che riflettano le ultime valutazioni degli alberghi. Al contrario, se le nuove recensioni sono sporadiche, aggiornamenti meno frequenti potrebbero essere sufficienti. 2. **Aspettative degli utenti**: I tuoi utenti si aspettano di vedere cambiamenti nei ranking basandosi sulle loro ultime interazioni (ad es. recensioni recenti)? Se è così, potresti dover considerare aggiornamenti relativamente frequenti per mantenere elevata la soddisfazione degli utenti. 3. **Risorse del server**: Aggiornare i ranking può richiedere una certa quantità di risorse di calcolo, soprattutto se il dataset è grande. Assicurati di bilanciare la necessità di aggiornamenti frequenti con la disponibilità di risorse del server per evitare di sovraccaricare il sistema. 4. **Complessità del calcolo dei ranking**: Se il tuo algoritmo di classifica è particolarmente complesso e richiede tempo per essere eseguito, dovrai forse considerare intervalli di aggiornamento più lunghi. In generale, un buon punto di partenza potrebbe essere impostare un aggiornamento dei ranking ogni 24 ore. Questo può darti un equilibrio tra la freschezza dei dati e il carico sul sistema. Tuttavia, potresti anche considerare un approccio dinamico, in cui la frequenza degli aggiornamenti si adatta al volume delle nuove recensioni: per esempio, potresti aggiornare i ranking ogni poche ore in periodi di alta attività e ridurre la frequenza durante periodi più tranquilli. Inoltre, considera la possibilità di permettere agli utenti di richiedere un aggiornamento dei ranking \\"on-demand\\" tramite una specifica funzionalità dell'applicazione, che potrebbe requisire l'esecuzione di un update in casi particolari, oltre agli aggiornamenti periodici pianificati. Infine, è importante monitorare l'effetto degli intervalli di aggiornamento sui tuoi utenti e sulle prestazioni del sistema per fare aggiustamenti in base al feedback e alle metriche raccolte."},{"prompt":"suggest me a channel name for kids entertainment video,quiz,fun games etc","completion":"\\"Brainy Bunch FunZone\\""},{"prompt":"suggest me 20 names","completion":"1. \\"KiddyQuest Adventures\\" 2. \\"Little Minds Playhouse\\" 3. \\"FunQuest Kids Club\\" 4. \\"Bright Sparks Entertainment\\" 5. \\"QuizzyKidz Junction\\" 6. \\"Laugh & Learn Land\\" 7. \\"Tiny Explorer Times\\" 8. \\"Junior Joy Jamboree\\" 9. \\"EduFun Kids Central\\" 10. \\"Giggle Gang Getaway\\" 11. \\"WizKidz Wonder World\\" 12. \\"Playful Minds Arena\\" 13. \\"SmartyPants Station\\" 14. \\"Twinkle Toons Town\\" 15. \\"Merry Minds Meetup\\" 16. \\"Puzzle Pals Playground\\" 17. \\"Brainy Buddies Basecamp\\" 18. \\"Adventure Awaits Hub\\" 19. \\"Knowledge Nook for Kids\\" 20. \\"Creative Critters Corner\\""},{"prompt":"Don't add kid in name","completion":"1. \\"Brainy Bunch FunZone\\" 2. \\"Quest & Quizz\\" 3. \\"LaughLearnPlay\\" 4. \\"Imagine Island\\" 5. \\"Bright Minds Games\\" 6. \\"Puzzle Paradise\\" 7. \\"FunQuest Universe\\" 8. \\"Whiz Wonder World\\" 9. \\"EduTainment Oasis\\" 10. \\"Giggle Grove\\" 11. \\"Explorer's Edge\\" 12. \\"Merry Minds Mansion\\" 13. \\"BrainBoost Lodge\\" 14. \\"Joy Jamboree\\" 15. \\"Adventure Anchorage\\" 16. \\"Creative Critters Club\\" 17. \\"Inventor's Isle\\" 18. \\"SmartyPants Plaza\\" 19. \\"Imagination Harbor\\" 20. \\"Thinker's Terrain\\""},{"prompt":"Suggest me 2 word name","completion":"1. \\"Playful Minds\\" 2. \\"Quizzy Corner\\""},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

What is the x-coordinate of the x-intercept of the resulting graph?","completion":"To find the x-coordinate of the x-intercept of the resulting graph after the translation, let's first understand the translation. The original equation of the line is given by: [9x - 10y = 19] A translation down by 4 units in the xy-plane means that every y-value on the graph will be decreased by 4. To apply this transformation, we'll subtract 4 from (y) in the equation and rearrange for the new equation of the line: The new y-value after translation down by 4 units would be represented by (y' = y - 4). Substitute (y') back into the original equation to get the equation for the translated line: [9x - 10(y - 4) = 19] Expand and simplify: [9x - 10y + 40 = 19] [9x - 10y = -21] The x-intercept occurs when (y=0). Substitute (y=0) into the simplified equation of the translated line to find the x-coordinate of the x-intercept: [9x = -21] Divide both sides by 9: [x = -frac{21}{9}] [x = -frac{7}{3}] So, the x-coordinate of the x-intercept of the resulting graph, after being translated down 4 units, is (-frac{7}{3})."},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

To evaluate this offer, Troy Engines, Limited, has gathered the following information relating to its own cost of producing the carburetor internally: Per Unit 20,000 Units per Year Direct materials 17 340,000 Direct labor 10 200,000 Variable manufacturing overhead 2 40,000 Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable 9* 180,000 Fixed manufacturing overhead, allocated 12 240,000 Total cost 50 1,000,000 *One-third supervisory salaries; two-thirds depreciation of special equipment (no resale value). Required: 1. Assuming the company has no alternative use for the facilities that are now being used to produce the carburetors, what would be the financial advantage (disadvantage) of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier?","completion":"To assess the financial advantage or disadvantage of buying carburetors from the outside supplier instead of producing them internally, we need to compare the relevant costs. Relevant costs are those that will change depending on the decision made. In this case, we exclude the fixed costs that will not change regardless of the decision, unless they are avoidable or directly attributable to the production of the carburetors. From the information given: Cost to Buy: - 36 per unit from the external supplier - For 20,000 units, the total cost to buy = 36 * 20,000 = 720,000 Cost to Produce Internally: - Direct materials: 340,000 - Direct labor: 200,000 - Variable manufacturing overhead: 40,000 - Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable: 180,000 (Since these are traceable to the carburetor production, they potentially could be eliminated if production is stopped.) - Fixed manufacturing overhead, allocated: 240,000 (Typically, these costs remain regardless of the decision, unless specified otherwise.) For the purpose of making this decision, the fixed manufacturing overhead that is allocated (240,000) is not considered a relevant cost unless it's specified that some portion of it can be avoided by not producing the carburetor. Therefore, we calculate the total relevant costs of producing internally by excluding the non-relevant (allocated) fixed overhead. Relevant Costs to Produce: - Direct materials: 340,000 - Direct labor: 200,000 - Variable manufacturing overhead: 40,000 - Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable: 180,000 Total Relevant Costs to Produce = 340,000 + 200,000 + 40,000 + 180,000 = 760,000 Financial Advantage (Disadvantage) of Buying: To find the financial advantage or disadvantage of buying, we subtract the cost to produce internally (only the relevant costs) from the cost to buy: 760,000 (cost to produce) - 720,000 (cost to buy) = 40,000 Thus, there would be a financial advantage of 40,000 to buy the carburetors from the outside supplier instead of producing them internally, assuming the company has no alternative use for the facilities currently used to make the carburetors. This analysis assumes all else being equal and focuses purely on the financial cost savings.

Given the calculations provided, the correct interpretation is indeed the financial impact of the decision. Let's clarify: When comparing the cost to produce internally (760,000, considering only the relevant costs) to the cost of buying externally (720,000), the calculation was: [ text{Cost to Produce Internally - Cost to Buy Externally} = 760,000 - 720,000 = 40,000 ] This result shows that it is cheaper by 40,000 to buy the carburetors from the outside supplier than to produce them internally. Therefore, if Troy Engines, Limited chooses to buy rather than produce, they would save 40,000. This saving represents a financial advantage, not a disadvantage, of choosing to buy the carburetors from the outside supplier. I apologize for any miscommunication in my initial explanation. The term \\"advantage\\" is indeed appropriate in this context, as buying the carburetors externally would result in a cost saving of 40,000 for the company."},{"prompt":"Write some new LEGO game ideas, with a list of features, levels, characters, and dialogues for every character.

Due to Shikai restoring the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] through the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] making himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China like in OTL, the post-Xinhai, post-Qing modern warlord era of modern Chinese history from 1916 to 1928 never happens due to the restored Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] continuing and [the restored Chinese monarchy] expanding on the federalist, parliamentary and democratic systems introduced to Han China proper by the Beiyang Government through the first ROC. Also, due to the post-1868, pre-1947 Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional democratic imperial royal monarchy of the Empire of Japan/Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Japanese Empire/Imperial Japan/Third Japanese Empire ruling [the Japanese Empire] over Russian Sahlakin and the Kurils, the Korean peninsula, the Carolinas, the Marinas and Palau from [the Japanese Empire's homebase] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan, [the Great Japanese Empire] sending in the Great Japanese Empire's primary ground force, the Imperial Japanese Army [IJA |Imperial Japanese Army|] and the Great Japanese Empire's naval warfare branch, the Imperial Japanese Navy [IJN], [the Great Japanese Empire sending the IJA and IJN] to post-Qing, post-Xinhai Greater Manchuria, [post-Qing, post-Xinhai Greater Manchuria] under the rule of [who rules post-Qing, post-Xinhai Greater Manchuria] the Han Chinese bandit warlord faction/Military junta of the Fengtian Clique that [the Fengtian Clique] had [the Fengtian Clique] occupied [the Fengtian Clique] both post-Xinhai, post-Qing Manchuria and the Beiyang Government of the First Republic of China under the control of [who headed the Fengtian Clique] the Han Chinese bannerman turned warlord after the Xinhai Revolution the \\"Old Marshal\\" Zhang Zhuolin, [the Great Japanese Empire sending the IJA and IJN to |the Great Japanese Empire| seize the post-Xinhai, post-Qing Fengtian Clique-ruled Greater Manchuria], making it [the post-Xinhai, post-Qing Fengtian Clique-ruled Greater Manchuria] into a Japanese protectorate [the post-Xinhai, post-Qing Fengtian Clique-ruled Greater Manchuria].

The Xinhai Revolution, a beacon of nationalist fervor ignited by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen and the Tongmenghui, catalyzed the collapse of the Qing Dynasty, marking the end of over two millennia of imperial rule. This revolutionary wave birthed the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China, a nascent state striving to navigate the tumultuous waters of modern statecraft and national identity. It was under these precarious conditions that Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general and a pivotal figure in the nascent republic, emerged as a key player in the reconfiguration of China's political landscape. Yuan Shikai's ascendancy to power was marked by a decisive move that would change the face of China. On 1 September 1915, eschewing the path he had initially seemed to tread - that of establishing himself as Emperor of a new dynasty - Yuan instead opted to restore the Ming Dynasty through the proclamation of the Empire of China, in a daring gambit to legitimize his rule and marshal the loyalty of the populace and the gentry who longed for a return to Han Chinese rule. This strategic restoration of the Imperial House of Zhu aimed not just at reclaiming a storied past but at forging a new vision for China, one that integrated the federalist, parliamentary, and democratic principles that the Beiyang Government had tentatively introduced. The reconstitution of the Empire of China under the aegis of the Ming did not merely signify a return to monarchical governance. Instead, it heralded the establishment of a novel Chinese state that sought to blend age-old traditions with emergent ideas of governance. The resilience of the Ming restoration was further bolstered by Yuan's savvy in navigating the international complexities of the time, notably in forging an uneasy but strategic partnership with the Japanese Empire, ensuring the survival and stabilization of his regime amidst internal contestation and external pressures. The National Protection War, while a crucible of conflict that tested the nascent Empire of China, ultimately served as a catalyst for its consolidation. The Empire's success, aided significantly by Japanese military expertise and strategic concessions made to the southeastern province of Yunnan, emboldened Yuan's regime to lay down the keystones of a rejuvenated Chinese state. This included not only modernization endeavors, spearheaded by industrialization and military reforms but also an innovative rehashing of the traditional system of hereditary peerage, blending nobility with meritocracy. The conflict, however, delineated new political and territorial realities. The emergence of a Cantonese nationalist faction in the erstwhile Nationalist China, embittered by defeat yet pragmatic in negotiation, secured a de facto independence for Cantonia. These negotiations, emblematic of the changing dynamics within China, ensured the sustenance of a bifurcated Chinese identity, with the Empire of China and Cantonia charting divergent paths yet linked by a shared heritage. Simultaneously, the Japanese-negotiated carve-out of Manchuria and the implicit renunciation of claims over Greater Mongolia, Tuva, East Turkestan, Tibet, and Shaanxi by the Empire of China signified a reimagined geopolitical reality. This reconfiguration was not a mere cession of territory but a strategic recalibration that sought to secure the Empire's core - the eighteen provinces of the historical Han heartland - while navigating the complexities of regional politics and international ambitions. The twentieth century thus witnessed the transformation of China from a beleaguered empire on the brink of disintegration to a rejuvenated state that sought to meld the grandeur of its imperial past with the promise of a democratic and federalist future. The Empire of China, under the restored Ming and the strategic stewardship of Yuan Shikai, embarked on a path that was as fraught with challenges as it was laden with opportunities. Its legacy, a testament to the enduring quest for national rejuvenation amid the shifting sands of modernity, would echo through the annals of history, shaping the contours of East Asian geopolitics and the saga of the Chinese nation for generations to come."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The relationship between wages and inflation is complex and multifaceted, with several factors influencing the dynamics between the two. 1. **Cost-Push Inflation**: If wages increase across the board without a corresponding increase in productivity, businesses may pass on the higher labor costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. This is known as cost-push inflation. In this scenario, rising salaries can contribute to inflation since the increased cost of production leads to higher prices for goods and services. 2. **Demand-Pull Inflation**: Rising salaries can also boost disposable income, which in turn increases consumer spending. If this higher demand cannot be met by an increase in supply, prices may rise, leading to demand-pull inflation. However, for rising salaries to contribute to demand-pull inflation, the wage increase must be widespread and significant enough to substantially boost overall demand in the economy. 3. **Productivity Growth**: On the other hand, if wage increases are matched by improvements in productivity, businesses can afford to pay their workers more without raising prices. In such cases, rising wages might not cause inflation. Indeed, productivity growth can lead to a situation where more goods and services are produced efficiently, possibly keeping inflation in check even as wages rise. 4. **Monetary Policy**: Central banks monitor wage growth as part of their mandate to control inflation. If wages rise faster than productivity, potentially leading to inflation, central banks might raise interest rates to cool off the economy. The effectiveness of such measures can influence whether wage increases lead to sustained inflation. 5. **Globalization and Market Dynamics**: In a globalized economy, domestic wage increases might not automatically lead to inflation if businesses can source cheaper inputs from abroad or if there's sufficient competition to keep prices low. Additionally, technological advancements and innovations can also offset wage-induced price pressures by reducing production costs. 6. **Distribution of Wage Increases**: The impact of wage increases on inflation also depends on how these increases are distributed across the economy. If wage rises are concentrated in sectors with low productivity gains, the inflationary impact might be more pronounced. Conversely, if wage increases are aligned with productivity growth across sectors, the inflationary pressure may be mitigated. In summary, while rising salaries can contribute to inflation under certain conditions, this is not an automatic or sole outcome. The actual impact of wage increases on inflation depends on various factors including productivity, market dynamics, and monetary policy. A nuanced understanding of these factors is essential for assessing the complex relationship between wages and inflation."},{"prompt":"Write a fictional blog post about the worst song ever, people even saying \\"it molested my ears\\"","completion":"Title: The Infamous Ear Offender: A Tale of Melodic Catastrophe Once in a moonless blue, the cosmos aligns in such a way that it dares to challenge the very foundation of our auditory sanctity. This alignment, dear readers, gave rise to what has been unanimously crowned as the worst song ever conceived by mankind, a musical venture so audaciously horrendous that it was declared a crime against eardrums. The song, known infamously as \\"Eardrum Apocalypse,\\" has elicited reactions so extreme, listeners have often exclaimed it \\"molested my ears\\" with its cacophonic nightmare. The Artist Behind the Atrocity Conceived by a one-hit-wonder gone rogue, \\"The Melodic Marauder,\\" whose identity remains shrouded in mystery and questionable fashion choices, sought to transcend the boundaries of music. However, little did the world know, this transcendence was to be a downward spiral into auditory oblivion. The artist proclaimed this track to be his magnum opus, a piece that would revolutionize the music industry. Alas, it did—just not in the way anyone hoped. The Composition of Chaos \\"Eardrum Apocalypse\\" begins with what can only be described as the digital equivalent of nails on a chalkboard, layered with off-key bagpipes and an inexplicable yodel that haunts the dreams of those who've endured it. As the intro mercifully concludes, the verse launches into a rap battle between a tone-deaf AI and a kazoo ensemble, battling over a beat that can be best likened to pots and pans falling down a flight of stairs. The chorus, oh, the chorus—imagine, if you will, the sound of a cat in a heated argument with a vacuum cleaner while in the background, a symphony of car alarms provides the \\"melody.\\" This cacophonous blend assaults the senses, testing the limits of human endurance and questioning our very understanding of music. The Fallout Upon its release, \\"Eardrum Apocalypse\\" was met with a mixture of shock, horror, and existential dread. Social media erupted with tales of woe from those brave enough to subject themselves to the song, many using the phrase \\"it molested my ears\\" to articulate the violation they felt at a sonic level. Music critics, ears bleeding and souls crushed, penned obituaries for what they once considered the unassailable dignity of musical artistry. The song was immediately banned in seventeen countries, not over censorship concerns, but as a public health measure to prevent mass auditory trauma. Attempts were made to scrub it from the internet, but like all things banished to the digital shadows, it found a cult following among those who wear their tolerance of it as a perverse badge of honor. The Legacy Despite its notoriety, \\"Eardrum Apocalypse\\" has inadvertently served a uniting purpose. Across cultural divides, political views, and personal tastes, humanity has found common ground in their shared disdain for what has been inflicted upon their ears. It spurred a global conversation about the limits of artistic expression and the responsibilities of creators to their audience. As for The Melodic Marauder, he vanished into the annals of internet infamy, leaving behind a legacy that continues to baffle and bind us in collective bewilderment. \\"Eardrum Apocalypse\\" may forever be remembered as the worst song ever produced, but perhaps its true purpose was to remind us of the power of music—to uplift, to devastate, and to unite us in the shared experience of what it means to feel, for better or for worse. Remember, dear readers, in a world filled with chaos, choose your soundtrack wisely, for not all songs lead to salvation—some, as we've painfully learned, lead straight to \\"Eardrum Apocalypse.\\""},{"prompt":"Conoces a la fundación SCP?","completion":"Sí, la Fundación SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect) es una organización ficticia documentada principalmente a través de una vasta cantidad de literatura colaborativa en internet. El concepto central de este proyecto creativo es la existencia de objetos, entidades y fenómenos anómalos o paranormales, colectivamente referidos como SCPs, cada uno con su propio conjunto único de propiedades y peligros. La fundación se dedica a la localización, contención y estudio de estos SCPs con el fin de proteger a la humanidad de sus potenciales efectos negativos. La Fundación SCP se originó de un post en el foro /x/ (paranormal) de 4chan en el año 2007, convirtiéndose rápidamente en un fenómeno de Internet. La comunidad ha crecido significativamente desde entonces, con miles de entradas (llamadas \\"archivos SCP\\" o \\"artículos SCP\\") escritas por una comunidad global de autores. Estos archivos usualmente toman la forma de documentos que describen detalladamente las características y procedimientos de contención de cada SCP, a menudo acompañados de historias adicionales que exploran la mitología, historia y operaciones internas de la Fundación SCP. El proyecto es notable por su uso extensivo de horror cósmico, ciencia ficción y elementos de fantasía oscura, así como por su estructura narrativa única, que permite a los participantes contribuir con sus propias creaciones a un universo compartido.

Se ha establecido un perímetro de seguridad camuflado, con vigilancia constante mantenida por personal de seguridad disfrazado de agentes forestales y arqueólogos. La entrada a SCP-XXXX está estrictamente prohibida sin aprobación previa de al menos dos miembros del personal de nivel 4. Las pruebas dentro de SCP-XXXX deben limitarse a drones y experimentos no tripulados siempre que sea posible debido a la naturaleza impredecible de su anomalía. En caso de que sea necesaria la intervención humana, los equipos de exploración deben estar equipados con cuerdas guía de 500 metros, sistemas de posicionamiento global ajustados a la especificidad de SCP-XXXX, y raciones de emergencia para un mínimo de 72 horas. **Descripción:** SCP-XXXX es una estructura residencial unifamiliar de dos pisos localizada en el centro de [REDACTADO], un pueblo abandonado en [REDACTADO]. El exterior de SCP-XXXX se asemeja a las construcciones vernáculas de la región, fechadas en el siglo XIX, sin embargo, su interior exhibe una violación significativa de las leyes de la física conocidas. Cuando un individuo atraviesa la puerta principal de SCP-XXXX y procede a desplazarse de una habitación a otra, el espacio interior no se ajusta a las expectativas externas de la estructura. Los sujetos han reportado entrar en bucles espaciales, en los cuales el intento de regresar a una habitación previamente visitada resulta en su aparición en un lugar diferente dentro de la casa, a menudo alejado del punto de partida original. Además de los bucles espaciales, los informes de los sujetos de prueba incluyen variaciones en el tiempo de percepción, con algunas instancias de exploradores experimentando lo que describen como horas o incluso días dentro de SCP-XXXX, a pesar de que los registros externos sólo muestran un lapso de tiempo de unos pocos minutos. La comunicación con el personal fuera de SCP-XXXX durante estos episodios es a menudo imposible, ya que los equipos de comunicación pierden funcionalidad o se distorsionan más allá de la comprensión. Los intentos de mapear el interior de SCP-XXXX han resultado infructuosos hasta la fecha, ya que las configuraciones de las habitaciones y corredores parecen cambiar con cada intento de exploración. No se ha determinado un patrón discernible o un gatillo para estos cambios. **Historial de Adquisición:** SCP-XXXX fue descubierto en [FECHA REDACTADA] después de que la policía local investigara los informes de desapariciones de varios excursionistas en la región de [REDACTADO]. Tras recuperar a dos supervivientes de un grupo de cinco, quienes instaron vehementemente sobre la \\"casa imposible\\" en el bosque, la Fundación intervino rápidamente, clasificando al edificio como SCP-XXXX. **Notas Adicionales:** - Se ha observado que objetos personales de sujetos de prueba perdidos dentro de SCP-XXXX aparecen esporádicamente en el umbral de la entrada, aunque no se ha recuperado a los individuos mismos. - En varias ocasiones, el personal de contención ha reportado escuchar voces y sonidos que parecen emanar desde el interior de SCP-XXXX en ausencia de presencia humana conocida.

Mi equipo y yo fuimos asignados a investigar SCP-XXXX, o como yo solía llamarlo, la Casa del Nunca Jamás. Se creía que este lugar guardaba respuestas a algunas de nuestras preguntas más urgentes sobre los límites del espacio y el tiempo. Nunca imaginé que también guardaría mis peores pesadillas. El día que cruzamos su umbral, el sol brillaba con fuerza sobre nuestros cuellos, presagiando los oscuros giros que estaban por venir. La casa nos recibió con un silencio sepulcral, como si estuviera esperando. Contrario a nuestras expectativas, el interior parecía el de una casa común y corriente, hasta que intentamos regresar a la entrada principal. Fue en ese momento cuando SCP-XXXX reveló su verdadera naturaleza. La puerta por la que habíamos entrado simplemente... había desaparecido. Decidimos mantener la calma. Después de todo, estábamos entrenados para esto. Pero a medida que avanzábamos de habitación en habitación, el pánico se instaló sutilmente entre nosotros. Cada puerta nos llevaba a un lugar completamente diferente; una vez, incluso volvimos a entrar a la misma habitación desde la que habíamos salido, aunque juraría que no era exactamente igual. Fue durante una de esas transiciones que perdimos a Marta. Uno segundo estaba allí, y al siguiente, no. Gritamos su nombre, buscamos en las habitaciones adyacentes, pero no había señal de ella. Fue el primer giro inesperado que nos llevó a la desesperación. Continuamos, movidos por una mezcla de miedo y determinación. Nos aferrábamos a la esperanza de encontrar no solo a Marta, sino una salida. No recuerdo cuánto tiempo estuvimos atrapados en ese ciclo infernal, cuando ocurrió el segundo giro. En una de las habitaciones, encontramos un diario. Al abrirlo, descubrí que pertenecía a Marta. Las entradas detallaban sus experiencias después de separarse de nosotros, cómo las habitaciones comenzaron a cambiar no solo en apariencia sino en naturaleza, volviéndose cada vez más siniestras. Pero lo más aterrador era la última entrada. Marta escribió que había encontrado una forma de salir y que nos esperaría al otro lado. No especificaba cómo, solo decía: \\"No confíes en tus ojos. La casa te engaña\\". Eso fue lo último. No había más páginas, ni más explicaciones. Reunimos nuestro coraje y seguimos su vago consejo. Cerramos los ojos y caminamos a través de la siguiente puerta, confiando únicamente en otros sentidos. Sentimos un cambio en el aire, un frescor que no habíamos experimentado desde que entramos. Al abrir los ojos, nos encontramos de nuevo bajo el sol, fuera de la casa. Sin embargo, Marta no estaba allí. Hemos buscado, llamado, esperado. Ha pasado tiempo desde ese día, y la Fundación ha sellado SCP-XXXX, declarándolo demasiado peligroso. Yo, por mi parte, no puedo dejar de preguntarme, ¿encontró Marta realmente una salida, o fue esa su última jugada desesperada dentro de una casa diseñada para engañar? Hasta hoy, cuando la luz se difumina, a veces me parece escuchar su voz llamándome, susurrando que hay una salida, que hay algo que nos perdimos. Y cada vez, la tentación de volver y buscarla crece. Pero SCP-XXXX ya no admite visitantes. Me quedo entonces con esta historia, una tragedia personal dentro de una tragedia mayor, perpetuamente preguntándome, perpetuamente esperando.

Um dieses Problem zu umgehen, können Sie mehrere Ansätze verfolgen: # 1. Verwendung von \`watch\` oder \`watchEffect\` Einer der effektivsten Ansätze ist die Verwendung von \`watch\` oder \`watchEffect\`, um Änderungen an der Route zu verfolgen. Dies gewährleistet, dass Sie auf \`route.meta\` zugreifen können, sobald die Route und ihre Metadaten verfügbar sind. \`\`\`vue <script setup> import { watchEffect } from 'vue'; import { useRoute } from 'vue-router'; const route = useRoute(); watchEffect(() => { console.log(route.meta); // Zugriff auf route.meta, sobald es verfügbar ist }); <\/script> \`\`\` # 2. Asynchrone Setup-Funktion Wenn Sie eine asynchrone Setup-Funktion verwenden, können Sie darauf warten, dass bestimmte Bedingungen erfüllt sind, bevor Sie fortfahren. Dies ist jedoch bei der Verwendung von \`route.meta\` nicht so direkt hilfreich, da es keine spezifische Promise gibt, auf die man warten könnte. Stattdessen ist \`watch\` oder \`watchEffect\` hier effektiver. # 3. Programmatic Navigation Wenn sich Ihr Fall um eine Navigation handelt, wo \`route.meta\` für eine Entscheidungsfindung benötigt wird (z.B.

Wenn Sie ein Array mit Objekten haben und Elemente entfernen möchten, bei denen nur ein bestimmter Schlüssel mit den Elementen eines anderen Arrays übereinstimmen muss, können Sie \`_.pullAllWith\` zusammen mit einer benutzerdefinierten Vergleichsfunktion verwenden. Hier ist ein Beispiel, das zeigt, wie Sie \`_.pullAllWith\` verwenden können, um Objekte aus einem Array zu entfernen, basierend darauf, ob ihr \`id\`-Schlüssel in den Objekten eines anderen Arrays vorhanden ist: \`\`\`javascript const _ = require('lodash'); // Anfangsarray mit Objekten let array = [ { id: 1, name: 'Objekt 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Objekt 2' }, { id: 3, name: 'Objekt 3' } ]; // Array mit Objekten, deren id-Schlüssel zum Entfernen verwendet werden sollen let elementsToRemove = [ { id: 2, name: 'Ein anderes Objekt 2' }, { id: 3, name: 'Ein anderes Objekt 3' } ]; // Verwendung von _.pullAllWith mit einer benutzerdefinierten Vergleichsfunktion _.pullAllWith(array, elementsToRemove, (arrVal, othVal) => { return arrVal.id === othVal.id; }); console.log(array); // Ausgabe: [ { id: 1, name: 'Objekt 1' } ] \`\`\` In diesem Beispiel verwendet \`_.pullAllWith\` drei Argumente: 1. \`array\`: Das Array, aus dem Elemente entfernt werden sollen. 2. \`elementsToRemove\`: Ein Array mit Elementen, auf Basis derer die Entfernung erfolgen soll. 3. Eine Vergleichsfunktion: Die Funktion erhält zwei Argumente: \`arrVal\` (ein Element aus dem \`array\`) und \`othVal\` (ein Element aus \`elementsToRemove\`). Die Rückgabe muss \`true\` sein, wenn das Element \`arrVal\` auf Basis der Bedingung entfernt werden soll; in diesem Fall überprüfen wir, ob die \`id\`-Schlüssel übereinstimmen.

Da \`_.unionBy\` von Lodash eine synchrone Funktion ist, geh ich davon aus, dass das Abrufen von \`newFiles\` oder ein Teil des Prozesses asynchron sein könnte. Ich werde ein Beispiel bereitstellen, in dem \`newFiles\` asynchron geladen wird und \`_.unionBy\` mit dem Ergebnis dieses asynchronen Aufrufs verwendet wird. \`\`\`javascript // Voraussetzung: Die fetchNewFiles Funktion ist eine asynchrone Operation, die newFiles zurückgibt async function fetchNewFiles() { // Beispiel: Eine asynchrone Operation, die eine Liste von Dateien (newFiles) zurückgibt return [ { file: 'Datei4', content: 'Inhalt 4' }, // Weitere Dateien... ]; } this.config[target] = async () => { // Await, um auf das Ergebnis der asynchronen Operation zu warten const newFiles = await fetchNewFiles(); // Sobald newFiles verfügbar ist, führen Sie _.unionBy aus return _.unionBy(remaining, newFiles, 'file'); }; \`\`\` In diesem Beispiel wird angenommen, dass \`fetchNewFiles\` die asynchrone Funktion ist, welche die neuen Dateien lädt (z. B. aus einer API oder einer Datenbank).

Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie den tatsächlichen Prozess zum Abrufen von \`newFiles\` in Ihrer Anwendung entsprechend anpassen, und beachten Sie, dass jeder Aufruf von \`this.config[target]\` jetzt eine asynchrone Operation ist, die mit \`await\` behandelt oder mittels Methoden wie \`.then()\` verarbeitet werden muss."},{"prompt":"nein, ich möchte bei this.config[target] bereits auf das ergebnis von _.unionBy( remaining, newFiles, 'file') warten","completion":"Wenn Sie bei \`this.config[target]\` bereits auf das Ergebnis von \`_.unionBy(remaining, newFiles, 'file')\` warten möchten, ohne eine explizit asynchrone Operation (wie das Abrufen von Daten aus einer Datenbank oder einer API) in diesem spezifischen Aufruf zu haben, dann scheint es, als ob ein Missverständnis vorliegt. Da \`_.unionBy\` eine synchrone Funktion von Lodash ist, gibt es keinen inhärent asynchronen Prozess, auf den man mit \`await\` warten könnte. Sollte Ihr Anwendungsfall jedoch darin bestehen, dass entweder \`remaining\` oder \`newFiles\` durch asynchrone Prozesse generiert werden, müssen diese Operationen als asynchron behandelt werden, bevor sie an \`_.unionBy\` übergeben werden. Wenn die Generierung von \`remaining\` und \`newFiles\` synchron bleibt und Sie einfach eine Syntax bevorzugen, die \`async\` und \`await\` für die zukünftige Einbindung asynchroner Logik verwendet, können Sie das einfach durch Hinzufügen von \`async\` vor der Funktionsdeklaration tun, auch wenn es aktuell keinen Unterschied macht: \`\`\`javascript this.config[target] = async () => { // Da _.unionBy synchron ist, gibt es hier eigentlich keine Notwendigkeit für await. // Die async-Angabe könnte aber für zukünftige asynchrone Anpassungen hilfreich sein. return _.unionBy(remaining, newFiles, 'file'); }; \`\`\` Das macht die Funktion zu einer, die eine Promise zurückgibt, allerdings ohne dass aktuell ein \`await\` für eine asynchrone Operation innerhalb der Funktion genutzt wird. Sie könnten dies tun, um die Funktion für zukünftige Anpassungen vorzubereiten, bei denen vielleicht einer der beiden Parameter (\`remaining\` oder \`newFiles\`) oder ein anderer Teil des Prozesses asynchron wird. In der Praxis, wenn \`remaining\` oder \`newFiles\` asynchron beschafft werden müssen, wäre der Code wie folgt: \`\`\`javascript this.config[target] = async () => { // Angenommen, getRemainingFiles() und getNewFiles() sind async Funktionen const remaining = await getRemainingFiles(); const newFiles = await getNewFiles(); return _.unionBy(remaining, newFiles, 'file'); }; \`\`\` In diesem Fall warten die \`await\` Statements auf die jeweiligen asynchronen Operationen, um \`remaining\` und \`newFiles\` zu generieren, bevor sie an \`_.unionBy\` übergeben werden."},{"prompt":"nein, ich muss die funktion return _.unionBy(remaining, newFiles, ‘file’); so warppen dass sie eine asynchrone funktion wird möglichst in einem einzeiler","completion":"Um die Funktion \`return _.unionBy(remaining, newFiles, 'file');\` in einer Weise zu \\"wrappen\\", sodass sie eine asynchrone Funktion wird und dabei möglichst einen Einzeiler beibehalten, können Sie einfach den Async Arrow Function Syntax nutzen.

Das bedeutet, dass Sie beim Aufrufen von \`this.config[target]\` das \`await\`-Keyword nutzen sollten oder mit der zurückgegebenen Promise über \`.then()\` und \`.catch()\` arbeiten könnten, um das Ergebnis von \`_.unionBy\` zu erhalten: \`\`\`javascript // Mit await innerhalb einer asynchronen Funktion const result = await this.config[target](); // Oder mit .then() und .catch() this.config[target]().then(result => { console.log(result); }).catch(error => { console.error(error); }); \`\`\` Dies macht \`this.config[target]\` effektiv zu einer asynchronen Funktion, die Sie mit \`await\` aufrufen können oder deren Promise Sie mit \`.then()\` und \`.catch()\` bearbeiten können, selbst wenn die eigentliche Logik von \`_.unionBy\` synchron bleibt."},{"prompt":"kann man nicht jede lodash funktion irgendwie einfach wrappen so das man auf ihr ergebnis warten kann?","completion":"Ja, theoretisch können Sie jede Lodash-Funktion (oder jede andere synchrone Funktion) so \\"wrappen\\", dass sie wie eine asynchrone Funktion behandelt wird. Dies ermöglicht es Ihnen, \`await\` zu verwenden, um auf das Ergebnis dieser Funktionen zu warten, selbst wenn diese Funktionen intern synchron arbeiten. Dies könnte praktisch sein, um eine konsistente Syntax bei der Verwendung von synchronen und asynchronen Funktionen zu gewährleisten oder um Ihren Code für zukünftige asynchrone Anpassungen vorzubereiten. Hier ist ein genereller Ansatz, um jede Lodash-Funktion asynchron zu „wrappen“: \`\`\`javascript const _ = require('lodash'); // Beispiel: Synchron funktioniert _.filter const synchronFunktion = _.filter; // Asynchrones \\"Wrapping\\" der synchronen Funktion async function asynchronWrapper(...args) { // Hier könnte Logik für asynchrone Operationen wie Datenbankabfragen oder API-Aufrufe hinzugefügt werden. return synchronFunktion(...args); } // Verwendung von await mit dem asynchronen Wrapper async function demo() { const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const ergebnis = await asynchronWrapper(array, n => n % 2 === 0); console.log(ergebnis); // [2, 4] } demo(); \`\`\` In diesem Beispiel wird \`_.filter\` als Beispiel für eine Lodash-Funktion genutzt. Die Funktion \`asynchronWrapper\` ist ein genereller Ansatz, um eine beliebige synchrone Funktion zu \\"wrappen\\". Sie nimmt dieselben Argumente wie die ursprüngliche synchrone Funktion (\`...args\` ist ein [Rest-Parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)), führt die synchrone Funktion mit diesen Argumenten aus und gibt ihr Ergebnis zurück. Da \`asynchronWrapper\` mit \`async\` markiert ist, gibt sie implizit ein Promise zurück, das das Ergebnis der synchronen Funktion umschließt. Beachten Sie, dass dieses \\"Wrapping\\" zwar technisch möglich ist, aber nicht immer sinnvoll. Die Verwendung von \`async\`/\`await\` führt zu einer leicht anderen Kontrollfluss- und Fehlerbehandlungslogik (durch den Einsatz von Promises), die in Szenarien, in denen keine tatsächliche Asynchronität vorliegt, unnötig kompliziert sein kann. Es ist in der Regel besser, klar zwischen synchronen und asynchronen Operationen zu unterscheiden und \`async\`/\`await\` nur dort zu verwenden, wo tatsächlich asynchrone Operationen durchgeführt werden."},{"prompt":"warum bekomme ich bei _.unionBy ein array mit proxys anstelle eines array mit objekten?","completion":"Wenn Sie in Ihrer Lodash \`_.unionBy\` Funktion ein Array mit Proxys anstelle eines Arrays mit gewöhnlichen Objekten erhalten, liegt das wahrscheinlich daran, dass mindestens eines der ursprünglichen Arrays, die Sie an \`_.unionBy\` übergeben haben, Proxy-Objekte enthält. Ein Proxy-Objekt in JavaScript wird verwendet, um benutzerdefinierte Verhaltensweisen für fundamentale Operationen (wie Eigenschaftszugriff, Zuweisung, Enumeration, Funktionsaufrufe usw.) auf das Zielobjekt zu definieren. Ein Beispiel hierfür könnte eine Situation sein, in der Proxys verwendet werden, um Änderungen an den Objekten zu überwachen oder Lazy Loading zu implementieren. Hier ist ein einfaches Beispiel, wie es zu solch einer Situation kommen kann: \`\`\`javascript let obj1 = { id: 1, name: 'Objekt 1' }; let obj2 = { id: 2, name: 'Objekt 2' }; let handler = { get: function(target, property) { console.log(\`Zugriff auf Eigenschaft {property}\`); return target[property]; } }; let proxyObj1 = new Proxy(obj1, handler); let proxyObj2 = new Proxy(obj2, handler); let result = _.unionBy([proxyObj1], [proxyObj2], 'id'); console.log(result); // Array von Proxys \`\`\` In diesem Beispiel sind \`proxyObj1\` und \`proxyObj2\` Proxy-Objekte, die jeweils \`obj1\` und \`obj2\` umhüllen. Wenn diese an \`_.unionBy\` übergeben werden, enthält das resultierende Array diese Proxys, weil die Operationen, die \`_.unionBy\` durchführt (wie Elementvergleich und -zusammenführung), direkt mit den übergebenen Elementen arbeiten, unabhängig davon, ob sie Proxys oder gewöhnliche Objekte sind. Dieses Verhalten ist meistens erwünscht und erwartet, da Proxys in JavaScript als transparente Wrapper um Objekte agieren sollen, die das Zielobjekt in jeder Hinsicht nachahmen, einschließlich der Art und Weise, wie sie in Datenstrukturen wie Arrays gehandhabt werden. Wenn Sie allerdings die zugrundeliegenden Objekte statt der Proxy-Objekte in Ihrem Ergebnisarray benötigen, müssen Sie diese explizit extrahieren. Dies könnte durch ein Mapping der Proxy-Array-Elemente auf ihre Zielobjekte vor der Verwendung in Lodash erreicht werden, abhängig davon, wie Ihre Proxy-Handler konfiguriert sind und wie Zugriff auf die Zielobjekte gewährt werden kann."},{"prompt":"wie mappe ich diese Proxy-Array-Elemente auf meinen Zielobjekte vor der Verwendung in Lodash","completion":"Das Mapping von Proxy-Objekten auf die ursprünglichen Zielobjekte, bevor sie in einer Lodash-Funktion wie \`_.unionBy\` verwendet werden, hängt stark davon ab, wie Sie Ihre Proxy-Objekte und deren Handler implementiert haben. In vielen Fällen bieten Proxy-Handler keinen direkten Mechanismus, um direkt auf das Zielobjekt zuzugreifen, weil das Konzept von Proxies gerade darin besteht, eine Abstraktionsschicht vor das Zielobjekt zu legen. Hier sind jedoch zwei Ansätze, die Sie in Betracht ziehen können, abhängig von Ihrer spezifischen Anwendung und Konfiguration: # Ansatz 1: Verwenden einer Referenz auf das Zielobjekt Wenn Sie Ihre Proxy-Objekte erstellen, könnten Sie eine Eigenschaft hinzufügen, die eine Referenz auf das Zielobjekt hält. Diese Referenz könnten Sie dann nutzen, um die Proxy-Objekte zu den Zielobjekten zu mappen. \`\`\`javascript let obj1 = { id: 1, name: 'Objekt 1' }; let obj2 = { id: 2, name: 'Objekt 2' }; // Fügen Sie eine Referenz auf das Zielobjekt im Proxy-Handler hinzu. let handler = { get: function(target, property, receiver) { if(property === '_target') { return target; } return Reflect.get(...arguments); } }; let proxyObj1 = new Proxy(obj1, handler); let proxyObj2 = new Proxy(obj2, handler); // Vor der Verwendung in _.unionBy, map auf Zielobjekte let array1 = [proxyObj1].map(proxy => proxy._target); let array2 = [proxyObj2].map(proxy => proxy._target); let result = _.unionBy(array1, array2, 'id'); \`\`\` Bitte beachten Sie, dass dieser Ansatz eine Modifikation Ihrer Proxy-Handler-Logik erfordert, um eine Referenz auf das Zielobjekt freizugeben, was möglicherweise nicht immer wünschenswert oder sicher ist. # Ansatz 2: Speichern Sie Zielobjekte separat Eine alternative Herangehensweise, die das direkte Mapping von Proxy-Objekten zu ihren Zielobjekten umgeht, besteht darin, die Zielobjekte parallel in einem separaten Array zu speichern. Wenn Sie dann Operationen mit Lodash durchführen müssen, nutzen Sie stattdessen dieses Array der Zielobjekte. \`\`\`javascript let obj1 = { id: 1, name: 'Objekt 1' }; let obj2 = { id: 2, name: 'Objekt 2' }; // Keine Änderungen am Proxy-Handler erforderlich let handler = { get: function(target, property, receiver) { return Reflect.get(...arguments); } }; let proxyObj1 = new Proxy(obj1, handler); let proxyObj2 = new Proxy(obj2, handler); // Speichern Sie Zielobjekte parallel let originals = [obj1, obj2]; // Verwenden Sie das Originals-Array in Lodash let result = _.unionBy(originals, 'id'); \`\`\` In diesem Fall wird das Array der Zielobjekte (\`originals\`) zur Durchführung der Operationen mit Lodash genutzt. Dies ist eine sichere und unkomplizierte Methode, die jedoch zusätzlichen Speicher und möglicherweise zusätzliche Logik zur Synchronisation der Zielobjekte und der Proxy-Objekte erfordert. Beide Ansätze haben ihre Vor- und Nachteile. Die Wahl des richtigen Ansatzes hängt von Ihren spezifischen Anforderungen und der Struktur Ihrer Anwendung ab."},{"prompt":"wenn obj2 bereits ein proxy objekt ist und obj2 ein array welches zu einem Pinia Proxy objkt gemacht werden soll ohne dass ich einen eigenen handler erstelle","completion":"Wenn Sie mit Vue 3 und Pinia arbeiten, kann es vorkommen, dass Sie mit Pinia's internen Proxy-Objekten zu tun bekommen. Vue 3 verwendet Proxies, um reaktive Zustände zu ermöglichen, und Pinia verwendet dies ebenfalls für seinen Store. Es gibt hierbei keine einfache und direkte Methode, ein existierendes Proxy-Objekt in ein anderes Proxy-Objekt oder speziell in ein Pinia Store-Objekt zu \\"konvertieren\\". # Direkte Arbeit mit vorhandenen Proxies In Vue 3 und Pinia sollten Sie in der Regel nicht versuchen, existierende Proxies direkt zu manipulieren oder in andere Typen von Proxies zu konvertieren. Stattdessen sollten Sie die reaktive Datenstruktur, wie sie ist, in Ihrer Anwendung integrieren und Vue 3 oder Pinia-spezifische Funktionen nutzen, um auf diese Daten zuzugreifen oder sie zu manipulieren. # Zugriff auf das ursprüngliche Objekt hinter einem Proxy Falls Sie auf das originale Zielobjekt hinter einem Proxy für spezifische Operationen zugreifen müssen, und Sie wissen, dass Sie es nicht direkt durch den Proxy erhalten können (da Vue es intern kapselt), könnten Sie überlegen, eine Referenz zum ursprünglichen Objekt an einer Stelle zu speichern, wo Sie darauf zugreifen können. Vue 3 und Pinia bieten jedoch keinen eingebauten Weg, um direkt von einem Proxy zum ursprünglichen Objekt zu gelangen, da das den Sinn der Reaktivität untergraben würde. # Reaktive Zustände in Pinia Wenn Sie ein Array oder ein Objekt haben, das Sie in einem Pinia Store reaktiv machen wollen, ist es am besten, es direkt bei der Definition des Stores zu tun, statt zu versuchen, nachträglich ein Proxy-Objekt zu \\"konvertieren\\". Ein Pinia Store-Beispiel könnte folgendermaßen aussehen: \`\`\`javascript // store.js import { defineStore } from 'pinia' export const useMyStore = defineStore('storeId', { state: () => { return { items: [] // Dies wird automatisch reaktiv } }, actions: { addItem(item) { this.items.push(item); // Reaktivität funktioniert automatisch } } }); \`\`\` # Empfehlung Es ist wichtig, die Konzepte der Reaktivität in Vue 3 und Pinia richtig zu verstehen und mit den angebotenen Methoden und Funktionen zu arbeiten, anstatt zu versuchen, die internen Details wie Proxies zu umgehen oder zu manipulieren. Die offiziellen Dokumentationen von Vue 3 und Pinia sind hervorragende Ressourcen, um tiefer in diese Themen einzutauchen. - [Vue 3 Reaktivität](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/reactivity.html) - [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)"},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

Чтобы написать скрипт для подбора объекта в Unity 3D, нам нужно создать скрипт, который бы позволял игроку \\"подбирать\\" объект при взаимодействии. Рассмотрим пример простого скрипта на C#, который позволит игроку подобрать объект при нажатии на кнопку (например, когда игрок находится достаточно близко к объекту). 1. Для начала создайте новый скрипт и назовите его, например, \\"PickupObject\\". 2. Откройте скрипт в редакторе кода (например, в Visual Studio или в MonoDevelop) и замените его содержимое на следующий код: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class PickupObject : MonoBehaviour { public float pickupRange = 5.0f; // Дистанция, на которой возможен подбор объекта public KeyCode pickupKey = KeyCode.E; // Кнопка для подбора объекта // Обновляем состояние каждый кадр void Update() { if (Input.GetKeyDown(pickupKey)) { Pickup(); } } void Pickup() { // Вектор от игрока к направлению взгляда, например, для FPS Ray ray = new Ray(transform.position, transform.forward); RaycastHit hit; if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit, pickupRange)) { if (hit.collider.gameObject.CompareTag(\\"Pickupable\\")) // Проверка тега объекта { Debug.Log(\\"Подобран объект: \\" + hit.collider.gameObject.name); // Здесь добавляем логику подбора - например, можно удалить объект сцены или добавить его в инвентарь Destroy(hit.collider.gameObject); // Удаляем объект для примера } } } } \`\`\` Чтобы использовать этот скрипт: 1. Добавьте его на ваш объект игрока. 2. Убедитесь, что у объекта, который вы хотите подобрать, есть коллайдер. Это необходимо для обнаружения столкновений с лучом. 3. Добавьте объекту тег \\"Pickupable\\" в редакторе Unity (Inspector -> Tag -> Add Tag -> и создайте новый тег \\"Pickupable\\", после чего выберите этот тег у нужного объекта). Это очень базовый пример, который можно расширять, добавляя различные функции, такие как анимация подбора, звуки и другие эффекты. Помните, что этот пример может потребовать доработки под конкретную задачу или игровой проект. Настройки дистанции подбора и кнопки можно изменять в инспекторе, добавив public переменные в ваш скрипт."},{"prompt":"А можешь изменить чтобы он перемещался к игроку к GameObject.","completion":"Конечно! Для реализации механизма, при котором объект будет перемещаться к игроку (или к указанному GameObject), нужно немного изменить логику. Давайте модифицируем предыдущий скрипт таким образом, чтобы когда игрок активирует подбор, объект начинает перемещаться к игроку, а не удаляется. Здесь я предполагаю, что у вашего игрока есть GameObject, к которому будет перемещаться объект (например, \\"рукой\\" или \\"точкой подбора\\"). Чтобы реализовать это поведение, нам понадобится добавить несколько вещей: 1. Ссылку на GameObject игрока или на точку подбора у игрока, куда будет перемещаться объект. 2. Механизм плавного перемещения объекта к игроку. Вот обновленный скрипт \`PickupObject\`: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class PickupObject : MonoBehaviour { public float pickupRange = 5.0f; // Дистанция, на которой возможен подбор объекта public KeyCode pickupKey = KeyCode.E; // Кнопка для подбора объекта public Transform pickupTarget; // Цель для перемещения (например, точка у игрока, куда должен двигаться объект) public float speed = 5f; // Скорость перемещения объекта к игроку private GameObject objectToPickup; // Объект, который будет подобран // Обновляем состояние каждый кадр void Update() { if (Input.GetKeyDown(pickupKey)) { TryPickup(); } // Если есть объект для подбора, перемещаем его к цели if (objectToPickup != null) { objectToPickup.transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(objectToPickup.transform.position, pickupTarget.position, speed * Time.deltaTime); // Проверяем, достиг ли объект цели if (Vector3.Distance(objectToPickup.transform.position, pickupTarget.position) < 0.1f) { // Здесь можно дописать логику, что делать, когда объект достиг цели // Например, удалить объект или добавить его в инвентарь Debug.Log(\\"Объект достиг цели: \\" + objectToPickup.name); Destroy(objectToPickup); // Удаление объекта для примера objectToPickup = null; // Сброс объекта для подбора } } } void TryPickup() { Ray ray = new Ray(transform.position, transform.forward); RaycastHit hit; if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit, pickupRange)) { if (hit.collider.gameObject.CompareTag(\\"Pickupable\\")) { Debug.Log(\\"Объект на подбор: \\" + hit.collider.gameObject.name); objectToPickup = hit.collider.gameObject; // Устанавливаем объект для подбора } } } } \`\`\` В этом скрипте: - Добавлена переменная \`pickupTarget\`, которая ссылается на GameObject (или точку у игрока), куда будет двигаться объект. - Добавлена переменная \`objectToPickup\` для хранения ссылки на объект, который игрок пытается подобрать. - В методе \`Update\` дополнен код для перемещения объекта к указанной цели с заданной скоростью. Не забудьте настроить скрипт в редакторе Unity: 1. Перетащите этот скрипт на объект, который будет инициировать подбор (например, игрока). 2. Укажите в полях скрипта объект-цель (\`pickupTarget\`), где объект будет \\"собираться\\" (это может быть точка в иерархии объекта игрока). 3. Настройте \`pickupRange\`, \`pickupKey\`, и \`speed\` в соответствии с вашими требованиями. Так вы создадите механизм, при котором после нажатия соответствующей клавиши выбранный объект будет плавно перемещаться к указанной точке у игрока."},{"prompt":"Можешь сделать чтобы объект не удалялся а как бы оставался в руках и ты мог его двигать","completion":"Чтобы объект не удалялся после подбора, а \\"оставался в руках\\" игрока и мог быть перемещён, нам понадобится немного другой подход. Мы можем сделать так, что после подбора объект будет \\"прилипать\\" к определённому месту (например, к рукам или перед камерой игрока) и следовать за ним. Для этого давайте изменён скрипт \`PickupObject\` так: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class PickupObject : MonoBehaviour { public KeyCode pickupKey = KeyCode.E; // Кнопка для подбора объекта public Transform holdingPoint; // Точка, где объект будет держаться после подбора private GameObject heldObject; // Объект, который сейчас держим private float pickupRange = 5.0f; // Дистанция, на которой возможен подбор объекта public float throwForce = 600f; // Сила, с которой объект будет выброшен private bool isHolding = false; // Флаг, держим ли мы сейчас объект void Update() { // Переключение состояния поднятия/бросания объекта if (Input.GetKeyDown(pickupKey)) { if (isHolding) { ThrowObject(); } else { TryPickup(); } } if (isHolding && heldObject != null) { // Держим объект в правильном положении heldObject.transform.position = holdingPoint.position; } } void TryPickup() { RaycastHit hit; // Отправляем луч от камеры (или игрока) вперёд в поисках объекта if (Physics.Raycast(transform.position, transform.forward, out hit, pickupRange)) { if (hit.collider.CompareTag(\\"Pickupable\\")) { heldObject = hit.collider.gameObject; heldObject.transform.SetParent(holdingPoint); // Делаем объект дочерним, чтобы он следовал за holdingPoint heldObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().useGravity = false; // Отключаем гравитацию для объекта, чтобы он не упал isHolding = true; } } } void ThrowObject() { if (heldObject != null) { heldObject.transform.SetParent(null); // Освобождаем объект, делая его снова независимым Rigidbody rb = heldObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); rb.useGravity = true; // Включаем обратно гравитацию rb.AddForce(transform.forward * throwForce); // Добавляем силу для \\"броска\\" объекта heldObject = null; isHolding = false; } } } \`\`\` Что этот скрипт делает: - \`pickupKey\` позволяет пользователю нажать клавишу для подбора или броска объекта. - \`holdingPoint\` – это Transform, который представляет место, где объект будет \\"держаться\\". Это может быть пустой GameObject, расположенный в руках персонажа или перед камерой, если вы делаете игру от первого лица. - \`heldObject\` хранит текущий поднятый объект. - В \`Update\` проверяется нажатие клавиши. Если игрок держит объект, он будет выброшен. В противном случае, пытаемся поднять объект. - Функция \`TryPickup\` пытается подобрать объект в пределах дистанции \`pickupRange\`. Если найден, объект \\"прилипает\\" к месту (\`holdingPoint\`), и его гравитация отключается. - Функция \`ThrowObject\` \\"отпускает\\" объект, возвращая ему гравитацию и добавляя силу для имитации броска. Не забудьте настроить вашу игру: 1. Создайте в иерархии объекта игрока пустой GameObject в качестве \`holdingPoint\` в нужном месте (например, перед персонажем). 2. Поместите этот скрипт на игрока. 3. Укажите в инспекторе Unity объект \`holdingPoint\`. 4. Убедитесь, что у объектов, которые должны подбираться, установлен тег \\"Pickupable\\" и что у них есть Collider и Rigidbody. Теперь, когда вы подходите к объекту и нажимаете кнопку подбора, объект \\"прилипнет\\" к указанному месту и будет следовать за персонажем, пока вы снова не нажмёте кнопку, тем самым \\"бросив\\" его."},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

They typically consist of aromatic materials that produce fragrant smoke when burned. Regarding health concerns, the burning process of incense sticks does release smoke, which contains particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and possibly other byproducts of incomplete combustion, like carbon monoxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The health impact of burning incense sticks can vary based on several factors, including the type of incense, the materials used to make it, the ventilation of the room in which it's burned, and the frequency and duration of burning. Exposure to incense smoke has been associated with certain health risks, particularly respiratory issues. People with asthma, allergies, or respiratory conditions could experience exacerbation of their symptoms upon exposure to incense smoke. Some studies have suggested a link between prolonged and frequent use of incense and an increased risk of certain cancers, although research in this area is not conclusive and more studies are needed to understand the potential health impacts fully. Here are a few tips for safer use of incense sticks: 1. **Ventilation**: Ensure the room is well-ventilated while the incense is burning and after, to disperse smoke and reduce inhalation of particulate matter. 2. **Duration and Frequency**: Limit the duration and frequency of burning incense sticks to minimize exposure to smoke. 3. **Quality**: Opt for incense sticks made with natural ingredients, as these are less likely to contain synthetic fragrances or materials that could produce harmful byproducts when burned. 4. **Sensitivity and Health Conditions**: Individuals with asthma, allergies, or any respiratory issues should be cautious and may want to avoid exposure to incense smoke. 5. **Placement**: Keep incense sticks away from flammable materials and ensure that the ash falls on a fireproof surface. While there are some concerns related to the health impacts of burning incense, using it mindfully and in moderation, with good ventilation and awareness of personal sensitivity, can mitigate some of these risks. If you have specific health concerns, consulting with a healthcare professional would be advisable."},{"prompt":"Suggest me 20 names for my youtube channel based on kids entertainment,fun game,quizz,puzzles etc","completion":"Creating a YouTube channel focused on kids' entertainment, fun games, quizzes, and puzzles is a promising idea!

The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China and the then embryonic KMT-ruled Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, [the still-embryonic Nationalist China] lead [the still-embryonic Nationalist China] by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen still happens but the reenthroned Chinese monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] manages to [the reenthroned Chinese monarchy] get Yunnan on its [the reenthroned Chinese monarchy's side] by allowing Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede from the Empire of China along with [Yunnan] subsequently restoring the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government [the reenthroned Chinese monarchy allowing a restored Daili Kingdom in Yunnan to secede from the Empire of China] in exchange for Yunnan aiding the Empire of China in the fight against the Chinese nationalists. The Empire of China also receives help from the Great Japanese Empire, which [the Great Japanese Empire] maintains its [the Great Japanese Empire's] indirect control over the Beiyang Government despite the restoration of the monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] in Han China through the Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China. IJA advisors help the Beiyang Government's armed wing and the combined armed forces of both the first Republic of China, the Beiyang Army modernize and develop and the Japanese also help the Empire of China to develop a modern system of hereditary peerage along with [the Japanese] helping it [the Empire of China] to [the Empire of China] industrialize and [the Empire of China] develop. The Empire of China is thus [the Empire of China] able to win the National Protection War against the Nationalists and [the Empire of China] restabilize Han China, although Nationalist China survives in its [Nationalist China's] stronghold of Cantonia [Guangdong and Guangxi]. The loss in the National Protection War leads to the ousting of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" from power in the rump Nationalist China and the emergence of a mostly buisness-oriented, anti-Chinese, anti-unification, pro-independence Cantonese nationalist and Cantonese independence clique to power and prominence in the government of the rump Nationalist China. These Cantonese nationalists and independence activists make a series of negotiations with the restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] that ensure the independence of the rump Nationalist China in Cantonia from the restored Ming Empire in Han China proper in all but name after the National Protection War. The Japanese also make a series of negotiations with the restored Chinese monarchy [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] that also ensure the independence of Manchuria from Han China and also states that the Empire of China will also not claim Greater Mongolia [Inner and Outer Mongolia], Tuva, East Turkestan, Tibet and Shaanxi, [the Empire of China] being [the Empire of China] restricted [the Empire of China] to the eighteen provinces of the now-long gone, long dissolved, Han Chinese Imperial House of Liu-ruled imperial absolute dynastic monarchy of the Great Han State/Great Han Empire/Empire of the Great Han/Great Han/\\"Han dynasty\\" in Han China proper.

This monumental event was precipitated by the ambitious machinations of Yuan Shikai, an unexpected architect of China’s imperial restoration. Instead of declaring himself emperor as many had anticipated, Yuan ingeniously facilitated the return of the Imperial House of Zhu to the throne, thereby channeling a thousand years of Chinese monarchical tradition towards the forging of a new era. The restoration of the Ming dynasty was met with a mixture of astonishment and approval throughout Han China and beyond its borders. This grand historical pivot was not an isolated endeavor but was intricately linked to the kaleidoscopic socio-political fabric of the region, particularly in relation to the ambitions of the Empire of Japan and the fragmenting allegiances within China itself. Yuan Shikai’s diplomatic mastery extended to the international arena, where he skillfully navigated the treacherous waters of early 20th-century geopolitics. The Empire of Japan, an ascendant power with its own imperialist ambitions, played a complex role as both a rival and an unlikely ally. Despite Japan's territorial appetites, it found in the re-established Ming dynasty a stabilizing force against the potential chaos of warlordism and revolutionary fervor that threatened its interests in the region. The Beiyang government’s cooperation with Japan, particularly in the modernization of its military and industrial capacities under the watchful eyes of IJA advisors, was a testament to the pragmatic, though uneasy, collaborations that marked this era. The Ming dynasty's return also cast a shadow over the revolutionary movements that had been gaining momentum across China. The National Protection War, a conflict that could have further fragmented China, instead served as a catalyst for consolidation. The Empire of China's unexpected victory, with the aid of Yunnan and Japanese military expertise, not only quelled the immediate threat from the Nationalists but also set a precedent for the handling of internal dissent and regional autonomy. Yunnan’s secession under the banner of a restored Dali Kingdom exemplified the dynasty's willingness to negotiate autonomy in exchange for unity against common threats. Meanwhile, the ripple effects of China’s internal consolidation were felt across its borders. The steadfast resolve of the Ming-revived state prevented the Northern Expedition, altering the trajectory of Chinese history by forestalling the rise of Nationalist dominion over the entirety of China. Instead, the Southern Nationalists found themselves confined to Canton, where a distinct blend of regional nationalism and pragmatic internationalism defined their governance. The Ming dynasty's strategic concessions and diplomatic maneuvers ensured its survival and adaptation in a rapidly changing world. Acknowledging the limits of its power, it ceded claims to territories like Manchuria, Mongolia, and East Turkestan, focusing instead on the core regions that bore the historical and cultural legacy of the Han Chinese. This reconfiguration of China’s territorial bounds reflected a realism that prioritized sustainable governance over imperial hubris. The international dimension of the Ming dynasty’s restoration underscored the interconnectivity of Asian geopolitics. The survival of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan, amidst these monumental shifts, epitomized the durability of regional powers in the face of broader imperial contestations. Thus, the re-emergence of the Ming dynasty marked not merely a return to monarchical governance but represented a profound transformation in the essence of Chinese statehood. Blending tradition with modernity, the new Ming state navigated the challenges of the 20th century with a pragmatism that reshaped not only the destiny of China but also the geopolitical landscape of Asia. In the rekindled glory of the Ming, a new chapter in the annals of Chinese civilization was written, signaling a future that honored its imperial past while confronting the inexorable march of modernity."},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

The company normally produces and sells 80,000 Daks each year at a selling price of 62 per unit. The company’s unit costs at this level of activity are given below: Direct materials 7.50 Direct labor 9.00 Variable manufacturing overhead 2.60 Fixed manufacturing overhead 8.00 (640,000 total) Variable selling expenses 3.70 Fixed selling expenses 4.50 (360,000 total) Total cost per unit 35.30 A number of questions relating to the production and sale of Daks follow. Each question is independent. The company has 600 Daks on hand that have some irregularities and are therefore considered to be \\"seconds.\\" Due to the irregularities, it will be impossible to sell these units at the normal price through regular distribution channels. What is the unit cost figure that is relevant for setting a minimum selling price? (Round your answer to 2 decimal places.)","completion":"To set a minimum selling price for the irregular Daks, we need to consider the relevant costs. Relevant costs are those that will change depending on the decision at hand. In this case, since the Daks are already produced, the sunk costs (costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered) such as direct materials, direct labor, and both fixed manufacturing and fixed selling expenses are not relevant to the decision about setting a minimum selling price for these units. The relevant costs are the variable costs, which include variable manufacturing overhead and variable selling expenses, that would be avoided if the product were not sold. Fixed costs are sunk in this scenario since they would remain the same regardless of the decision to sell the seconds. Here are the relevant variable costs per unit: - Variable manufacturing overhead: 2.60 - Variable selling expenses: 3.70 These are the costs that would not be incurred if the seconds were not sold. Thus, they are relevant for setting the minimum price. Adding these relevant variable costs gives us: 2.60 + 3.70 = 6.30 The total relevant cost per unit is 6.30. This is the minimum cost figure relevant for setting a minimum selling price. Any selling price above 6.30 would cover the variable costs of selling these \\"seconds\\" and contribute to covering fixed costs and potentially generating profit."},{"prompt":"Troy Engines, Limited, manufactures a variety of engines for use in heavy equipment. The company has always produced all of the necessary parts for its engines, including all of the carburetors. An outside supplier has offered to sell one type of carburetor to Troy Engines, Limited, for a cost of 36 per unit. To evaluate this offer, Troy Engines, Limited, has gathered the following information relating to its own cost of producing the carburetor internally: Per Unit 20,000 Units per Year Direct materials 17 340,000 Direct labor 10 200,000 Variable manufacturing overhead 2 40,000 Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable 9* 180,000 Fixed manufacturing overhead, allocated 12 240,000 Total cost 50 1,000,000 *One-third supervisory salaries; two-thirds depreciation of special equipment (no resale value). Suppose that if the carburetors were purchased, Troy Engines, Limited, could use the freed capacity to launch a new product. The segment margin of the new product would be 200,000 per year. Given this new assumption, what would be the financial advantage (disadvantage) of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier?","completion":"To calculate the financial advantage or disadvantage of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier as opposed to producing them internally, we need to examine the relevant costs and benefits associated with each option. # Cost of Making Internally The current total cost of producing 20,000 carburetors internally is comprised of direct materials, direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, fixed manufacturing overhead (both traceable and allocated). However, for the comparison, we should consider only the costs that would change if Troy Engines, Limited, decides to buy the carburetors instead. **Relevant costs for making carburetors internally:** - Direct materials: 340,000 - Direct labor: 200,000 - Variable manufacturing overhead: 40,000 - Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable: 180,000 (Since this cost could potentially be avoided if production stops.) The allocated fixed manufacturing overhead (240,000) should not be considered relevant because it would likely continue whether the carburetors are made internally or not. **Total relevant costs of making internally:** 340,000 + 200,000 + 40,000 + 180,000 = 760,000 # Cost of Buying The cost of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier at 36 per unit: 20,000 units x 36 = 720,000 # Opportunity Gain from Using Freed Capacity If Troy Engines, Limited, can use the freed capacity to launch a new product that would contribute a segment margin of 200,000 per year, this amount should be considered an additional financial benefit when determining the advantage or disadvantage of buying. # Net Financial Advantage (Disadvantage) Calculation **Savings from Buying Internally:** - (760,000) - (720,000) = (40,000) This represents a direct saving from buying externally instead of making the carburetors internally, not yet accounting for the opportunity of the new product. When you add the opportunity gain from using the freed capacity: - Opportunity Gain: 200,000 **Net Advantage of Buying:** - Direct Savings: (40,000) (Since it's a saving, we'll consider it a positive outcome for this context) - Opportunity Gain: +200,000 - Net Financial Advantage = 40,000 + 200,000 = 240,000 This calculation suggests that Troy Engines, Limited, would have a financial advantage of 240,000 per year if it decides to buy the carburetors from the outside supplier and use the free capacity to launch the new product."},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

Он помогает в борьбе с окислением и сохраняет свежесть вина, а также предотвращает рост микроорганизмов, которые могут испортить вино. Однако диоксид серы имеет и негативные стороны при взаимодействии с организмом человека, особенно при чувствительности или аллергии. Воздействие на организм человека: 1. **Раздражение**: Диоксид серы может вызвать раздражение глаз, носа, горла и легких, особенно у людей, страдающих астмой или другими заболеваниями дыхательных путей. 2. **Аллергические реакции**: Некоторые люди могут испытывать аллергические реакции на диоксид серы, которые могут проявляться в виде сыпи, крапивницы или даже анафилактического шока в редких случаях. 3. **Головные боли**: Было замечено, что у чувствительных людей после употребления продуктов и напитков с содержанием диоксида серы, в том числе вина, могут возникать головные боли. 4. **Пищеварительные проблемы**: В некоторых случаях употребление продуктов с диоксидом серы может вызвать желудочно-кишечные неприятности, такие как диарея или вздутие. Хотя количество диоксида серы в вине обычно невелико и для большинства людей безопасно, производители вина обязаны указывать на этикетках предупреждение о содержании сульфитов (соединений, содержащих диоксид серы), чтобы информировать потребителей, особенно тех, кто чувствителен к этому веществу. Важно отметить, что потребление алкоголя должно быть умеренным, поскольку чрезмерное употребление может привести к серьезным здоровьесберегающим последствиям, независимо от содержания диоксида серы."},{"prompt":"Водка на каком спирте лучше альфа или люкс?","completion":"Водка может производиться на основе различных видов этанолового ректификата, среди которых «Альфа» и «Люкс» являются высшими сортами. Эти сорта этанола отличаются степенью очистки и предназначены для производства высококачественных алкогольных напитков. **Спирт «Альфа»** — это высшая категория спирта, предназначенная исключительно для производства высококачественных напитков. Спирт этой категории проходит множественную перегонку и очистку, в результате чего из него удаляются практически все примеси, включая специфические вторичные компоненты, которые могут оказывать влияние на вкус и аромат готового продукта. Водка на спирте «Альфа» обычно отличается мягкостью и чистотой вкуса. **Спирт «Люкс»** также является высококачественным спиртом и используется для производства качественных водочных и спиртосодержащих изделий. Он также подвергается многостадийной очистке, но критерии для спирта «Люкс» немного менее строгие по сравнению с «Альфа». Водка на спирте «Люкс» также отличается высоким качеством, но может иметь немного более выраженный вкус и аромат по сравнению с водкой на спирте «Альфа». Выбор между водкой на спирте «Альфа» и «Люкс» во многом зависит от индивидуальных предпочтений. Любители мягкости и чистоты вкуса склоняются к выбору водки на спирте «Альфа», в то время как те, кто ценит немного более насыщенные вкусовые качества, могут предпочесть водку на спирте «Люкс».

Однако, запрос \`SELECT COUNT(question) FROM answers WHERE id = ?\` некорректен, потому что условие \`WHERE id = ?\` должно фильтровать по \`user_id\`, а не по \`id\`, который является уникальным идентификатором каждой записи ответа. Поэтому, условие должно быть \`WHERE user_id = ?\`. Тем не менее, корнем проблемы является то, что вместо использования подсчёта записей в таблице \`answers\`, лучше напрямую получать значение \`last_question_idx\` из таблицы \`users\`, которое как раз предназначено для этой цели. Вот как можно исправить эту логику: 1. Исправьте запрос в функции \`generate_bio\` на получение \`last_question_idx\` из таблицы \`users\`.

Бот по-прежнему начинает всегда с первого вопроса. Пожалуйста, изучи код ОЧЕНЬ ВНИМАТЕЛЬНО","completion":"Просмотрев код ещё раз, я обнаружил, что проблема действительно связана с обработкой состояний после перезапуска бота пользователем с помощью команды /start. Проблема не в функции \`generate_bio\` напрямую, а в том, как и когда эта функция вызывается, а также как управляется состояние пользователя. При нажатии на кнопку \\"Сгенерировать био\\", функция \`generate_bio\` правильно вызывается, однако, она должна уметь корректно определить, с какого места пользователю следует продолжить. Ошибка, которую я упустил в предыдущем ответе, касается запроса в этой функции, где определяется, с какого вопроса начать. Смотря на функцию \`generate_bio\`, я заметил, что мой предыдущий совет исправить запрос был не полностью корректен, тем более что основная проблема в коде заключается в другом месте. Ключевым моментом является неправильное использование или неиспользование сохранённого индекса последнего вопроса пользователя. Давайте пересмотрим тот момент, когда пользователь запускает бота с \`/start\`, и проверим, вызывается ли \`generate_bio\` должным образом и адекватно ли работает выборка из базы данных. \`\`\`python @dp.message_handler(commands=\\"start\\", state=\\"*\\") async def cmd_start(message: types.Message): markup = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(resize_keyboard=True, one_time_keyboard=True) markup.add(KeyboardButton(\\"Сгенерировать био\\")) markup.add(KeyboardButton(\\"Личный кабинет\\")) await message.answer(\\"Выберите действие:\\", reply_markup=markup) await Form.choosing_action.set() \`\`\` В данном случае, когда пользователь нажимает \\"/start\\", ему показывается меню, но автоматического восстановления состояния или пропуска уже отвеченных вопросов не происходит. Получается, пользователь должен снова выбрать \\"Сгенерировать био\\", и только тогда функция \`generate_bio\` будет вызвана. Но ошибка заключалась в том, что я не предоставил исправление для неправильного запроса в функции \`generate_bio\`. После внимательного пересмотра начального кода я понимаю, что неясно описал процесс поиска решения проблемы. В самом деле, неправильный запрос в функции \`generate_bio\` мог бы быть причиной, если бы в этой функции происходил неправильный выбор следующего вопроса. Неправильный выбор может быть вызван некорректной проверкой \`if count:\` (которая должна была бы проверять \`last_question_idx\`), но изначально вместо исправления запроса SELECT и использования \`last_question_idx\`, я указал на важность коррекции самого запроса без точного указания на это решение. Итак, проверка и исправление должны касаться того, как обновляется и используется \`last_question_idx\`. Если после перезапуска командой \`/start\` бот всегда начинает с первого вопроса, то это значит, что или состояние пользователя (FSM) не сбрасывается корректно, или механизм определения следующего вопроса на основе \`last_question_idx\` работает некорректно. Для предоставления конкретного исправления на базе текущего кода, пожалуйста, убедитесь, что исправленная часть функции \`generate_bio\` или аналогичный кусок кода аккуратно проверяет \`last_question_idx\` и правильно устанавливает состояние пользователя, чтобы возобновить диалог с места остановки. Необходимо проверить логику сохранения \`last_question_idx\` в функциях \`save_answer\` и корректную обработку этого индекса в функции, которая отвечает за переход к следующему вопросу после перезапуска через \`/start\`. Убедитесь, что сохранение и обновление состояния функционирует должным образом. Повторное внимательное изучение процесса уточнило анализ, и я признаю, что первоначальный комментарий не указывал на ясное и точное решение. Проблема с началом с первого вопроса после перезапуска стоит в контексте правильного использования индекса последнего отвеченного вопроса и корректном восстановлении состояния диалога с пользователем."},{"prompt":"Итак, в итоге, как исправить ошибку?","completion":"Извините за путаницу в предыдущих ответах.

Проблема заключается в том, что при каждом вызове команды \`/start\` бот начинает диалог сначала, не проверяя, были ли уже даны ответы на вопросы. **Шаг 1**: Исправьте запрос в \`generate_bio\`, чтобы проверять \`last_question_idx\` из таблицы \`users\`, а не количество ответов в \`answers\`. **Шаг 2**: На основе \`last_question_idx\`, определите, с какого вопроса должно продолжаться взаимодействие с пользователем. **Внесём необходимые изменения:** Заметим, что в функции \`generate_bio\` неверно реализована проверка и переход к следующему неотвеченному вопросу. Вместо того чтобы проверять количество записей в таблице \`answers\`, нужно проверить \`last_question_idx\` из таблицы \`users\`.

Если у пользователя \`last_question_idx\` равняется количеству вопросов (или превышает это значение), это должно означать, что все вопросы были ответы, и бот может сообщить об этом пользователю или перевести его в личный кабинет для просмотра ответов. **Если вышеупомянутая реализация не помогает**: Убедитесь, что \`last_question_idx\` корректно обновляется в функции \`save_answer\` после каждого ответа пользователя. Ошибка может быть в неправильном обновлении или сохранении значения \`last_question_idx\`, что ведёт к тому, что бот \\"забывает\\", какие вопросы уже были заданы.

Один из способов сделать это — добавить вызов \`add_user\` в обработчик команды \`/start\`: \`\`\`python @dp.message_handler(commands=\\"start\\", state=\\"*\\") async def cmd_start(message: types.Message): user_id = message.from_user.id username = message.from_user.username or \\"unknown\\" # Добавляем пользователя в базу данных await add_user(user_id, username) markup = ReplyKeyboardMarkup(resize_keyboard=True, one_time_keyboard=True) markup.add(KeyboardButton(\\"Сгенерировать био\\")) markup.add(KeyboardButton(\\"Личный кабинет\\")) await message.answer(\\"Выберите действие:\\", reply_markup=markup) await Form.choosing_action.set() \`\`\` **Шаг 2:** Проверяем работу функции \`add_user\` Убедитесь, что функция \`add_user\` реально добавляет (или обновляет) запись пользователя в базе данных. Вероятно, дело в правильности SQL запроса. Проще провести дебаг или добавить вывод в консоль/логи после этой функции для отслеживания успешного выполнения запроса. \`\`\`python async def add_user(user_id: int, username: str): async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: cursor = await db.execute('SELECT id FROM users WHERE id = ?', (user_id,)) user_exists = await cursor.fetchone() if user_exists: await db.execute('UPDATE users SET username = ?, last_question_idx = 0 WHERE id = ?', (username, user_id)) else: await db.execute('INSERT INTO users (id, username) VALUES (?, ?)', (user_id, username)) await db.commit() \`\`\` **Шаг 3:** Убедитесь, что БД работает Если функция \`create_db\` вызывается правильно и таблица \`users\` создаётся на старте бота, проверьте, нет ли ошибки в параметрах подключения к базе данных или в SQL запросах. Иногда проблема может быть в пути к файлу БД или в правах доступа, если БД хранится на диске, а не в памяти. **Шаг 4:** Дебаг и логирование Для поиска проблемы может понадобиться добавить дополнительное логирование в ключевые моменты работы с БД, чтобы увидеть, выполняются ли запросы корректно и сохраняются ли данные. Python предоставляет встроенный модуль \`logging\` для удобного логирования. \`\`\`python import logging # Настройте логгер на начальном этапе вашего приложения logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) # Используйте logging для отслеживания выполнения logging.info(\\"Добавляем нового пользователя\\") \`\`\` Внимательно проверьте каждый из этих шагов, чтобы удостовериться, что пользователи корректно добавляются в базу данных. Это будет ключевым для решения основной проблемы."},{"prompt":"Create an OP FM24 tactic that uses a good formation that exploits and creats a lot of space. Make sure it will give my team a 22:2 shot ratio agaisnt the opposiiton","completion":"Creating an OP (Overpowered) tactic in Football Manager 2024 (FM24) that specifically achieves a 22:2 shot ratio in every match could be challenging due to the complex match engine that simulates a vast array of variables. However, I can suggest a highly effective formation and tactical setup aimed at dominating possession, creating ample scoring opportunities, and limiting the opposition's chances. Success in FM24, as in real football, varies depending on the quality of your squad, the opposition, and sometimes in-game randomness. That said, a 4-2-3-1 Wide formation is versatile and can be tailored to exploit spaces effectively. # Formation: 4-2-3-1 Wide - **Goalkeeper (GK)**: Sweeper Keeper (Support) - Enable him to play out from the back and initiate your attacks. - **Defenders**: Two Central Defenders (CD) on Defend, with Full Backs (FB) on Attack. Your FBs will provide width and drive forward to support the wingers, creating overloads and stretching the opposition defense. - **Defensive Midfielders (DM)**: One Deep Lying Playmaker (DLP) on Defend to recycle possession and dictate the tempo from a deeper position. Beside him, use a Ball Winning Midfielder (BWM) on Support to aggressively win the ball back. - **Attacking Midfielders (AM)**: - Wingers (W) on Attack - Pace and dribbling are key. They should be instructed to hug the line to stretch the defense and then cut inside or cross depending on the situation. - Attacking Midfielder (AM) - Advanced Playmaker (Support). He is pivotal in creating chances and exploiting the space between the opposition's midfield and defense. Encourage him to roam from position. - **Striker (ST)**: A Complete Forward (Support) - This role allows the striker to drop back into space, link-up play, and still lead the attack. # Team Instructions: - **Mentality**: Positive - Strikes a balance between being cautious and aggressive. - **In Possession**: - Play Out of Defence: Encourages the team to maintain possession. - Shorter Passing & Higher Tempo: Maintains possession but increases the pace of play. - Work Ball into Box: Reduces long shots and focuses on creating clear-cut chances. - Overlap Left and Right: Instructs full-backs to overlap, creating width and space. - **In Transition**: - Counter-Press: Once possession is lost, immediately attempt to win it back. - Counter: Exploit the space behind the opposition's defense upon regaining possession. - **Out of Possession**: - Higher Defensive Line and Higher Line of Engagement: Compresses the space and pushes play into the opposition half. - More Urgent Pressing: Increases the chance to win the ball back quickly. # Additional Tips: - Adjust player roles and team instructions based on your squad's strengths and weaknesses. - For tough away games or against stronger teams, consider adjusting the mentality to Balanced or even Cautious, and tweak the defensive line to be lower. - Pay attention to opposition instructions, specifically targeting their playmaker or key player for marking or pressing. Note that while this tactic is designed to control the game and create numerous scoring opportunities, success can vary. Adaptation and tweaks based on the match context and opponent are crucial. Moreover, training sessions that focus on team cohesion, attacking movement, and defensive shape will help in optimizing performance according to this tactical setup."},{"prompt":"Troy Engines, Limited, manufactures a variety of engines for use in heavy equipment. The company has always produced all of the necessary parts for its engines, including all of the carburetors. An outside supplier has offered to sell one type of carburetor to Troy Engines, Limited, for a cost of 36 per unit. To evaluate this offer, Troy Engines, Limited, has gathered the following information relating to its own cost of producing the carburetor internally: Per Unit (20,000 Units per Year) Direct materials 17 ( 340,000) Direct labor 10 (200,000) Variable manufacturing overhead 2 (40,000) Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable 9* (180,000) Fixed manufacturing overhead, allocated 12 (240,000) Total cost 50 ( 1,000,000) *One-third supervisory salaries; two-thirds depreciation of special equipment (no resale value). Suppose that if the carburetors were purchased, Troy Engines, Limited, could use the freed capacity to launch a new product. The segment margin of the new product would be 200,000 per year. Given this new assumption, what would be the financial advantage (disadvantage) of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier?","completion":"To determine the financial advantage or disadvantage of buying carburetors from the outside supplier, we must calculate the costs saved by not producing them internally and the additional income generated from the new product, then offset these gains against the cost of purchasing the carburetors from the outside supplier. # Costs Saved by Not Producing Internally If Troy Engines, Limited, stops producing the carburetors internally, it would save the variable costs and any avoidable fixed costs. The unavoidable (or sunk) costs, such as allocated fixed manufacturing overhead, would not be saved because these would continue regardless of the decision. - **Direct materials:** 340,000 saved - **Direct labor:** 200,000 saved - **Variable manufacturing overhead:** 40,000 saved - **Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable (avoidable):** 180,000 saved Note: The 180,000 traceable fixed manufacturing overhead is considered avoidable. This includes supervisory salaries and depreciation of special equipment that wouldn’t have any resale value, but these expenses wouldn't be incurred if the carburetors were no longer produced. # Total Costs Saved Total costs saved = Direct materials + Direct labor + Variable manufacturing overhead + Traceable fixed manufacturing overhead Total costs saved = 340,000 + 200,000 + 40,000 + 180,000 = 760,000 # Cost of Buying Carburetors Cost of buying 20,000 carburetors = 20,000 units × 36/unit = 720,000 # Additional Income from New Product - **Segment margin of new product:** 200,000 # Financial Advantage (Disadvantage) Calculation Financial advantage = Costs saved + Additional income - Cost of buying carburetors Financial advantage = 760,000 + 200,000 - 720,000 = 240,000 Therefore, buying the carburetors from the outside supplier and using the freed capacity to launch a new product would result in a financial advantage of 240,000 for Troy Engines, Limited."},{"prompt":"What can I do with OpenVPN for a cybersecurity project in my local pc?","completion":"OpenVPN is a powerful tool for creating encrypted tunnels over the internet, ensuring that data transmitted between your computer and the internet is secure and private. For a cybersecurity project on your local PC, there are several interesting and educational things you can do with OpenVPN. Here are some ideas: # 1. **Set Up Your Own VPN Server** - **Learn the Basics**: Understand how VPNs work by setting up your own OpenVPN server on your local PC or on a cloud instance (like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean). Configure it to accept connections from client devices. - **Networking Skills**: You'll learn about networking, IP routing, and firewall rules as you configure the server to route client traffic. # 2. **Explore Encryption and Authentication Mechanisms** - **Hands-On with Cryptography**: Deep dive into the encryption methods used by OpenVPN, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Experiment with different encryption strengths and authentication methods (e.g., certificates, pre-shared keys, username/password). - **Create and Sign Your Own Certificates**: Use Easy-RSA or another certificate authority (CA) tool to create your own digital certificates for both the server and the clients. This teaches you about PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and the importance of certificate management in cybersecurity. # 3. **Implement and Test Security Policies** - **Restrict Access**: Configure your VPN server to restrict access to certain services or websites for connected clients. This could involve pushing specific routing rules or using iptables for more granular control. - **Detect and Mitigate Attacks**: Simulate network attacks on your VPN (within ethical boundaries) and implement strategies to detect and mitigate these attacks. For example, use fail2ban to protect against brute force attacks. # 4. **Integrate with Other Security Tools** - **Logging and Monitoring**: Set up detailed logging on your OpenVPN server and integrate with tools like Splunk or ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic. - **Combine with IDS/IPS**: Integrate your VPN with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to further enhance the security of the VPN traffic. # 5. **Create a Secure Remote Access Solution** - **Remote Work Simulation**: Imagine a scenario where employees need secure remote access to a company's internal network. Use OpenVPN to create a secure environment that simulates this, including setting up split-tunneling to differentiate between internal and external traffic. # 6. **VPN Penetration Testing** - **Vulnerability Assessment**: Conduct a vulnerability assessment of your OpenVPN setup. Use tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or manual pentesting techniques to identify potential security weaknesses. - **Security Hardening**: Based on your findings, research and apply security hardening techniques to your OpenVPN server. Document the before and after to understand the impact of your changes. # 7. **Educate Others** - **Write a Guide or Blog Post**: Share your journey of setting up and securing your OpenVPN server. Highlight common pitfalls, tips, and best practices. - **Workshops or Webinars**: Host a workshop or webinar teaching others how to securely set up their VPNs. Use your project as a case study. # Conclusion An OpenVPN-based cybersecurity project can encompass a wide range of topics from networking fundamentals to advanced cybersecurity practices. Such a project will not only help you understand VPNs and network security on a deeper level but also give you hands-on experience with tools and technologies used in cybersecurity. For educational purposes, make sure any experiments or testing are conducted in a controlled and ethical manner, without harming any third-party services or networks."},{"prompt":"Can I use OpenVPN on my live host machine...and connect it to VM?","completion":"Yes, you can use OpenVPN on your live host machine and connect it to a virtual machine (VM). This setup is quite common for various use cases, such as creating a secure testing environment, accessing resources hosted in a VM securely from anywhere, or experimenting with network configurations and security practices. Here’s a basic overview of how you might achieve this: # 1. **Setting Up OpenVPN Server** - **On the Host Machine**: The OpenVPN server can be set up on your host machine. This involves installing the OpenVPN software, configuring server settings (such as port, protocol, and encryption options), and setting up networking (including IP addressing and routing). - **Generate Certificates**: As part of the setup process, you'll need to generate cryptographic certificates and keys for the server and clients. This ensures secure communication between the server and client(s). # 2. **Configuring the VM as an OpenVPN Client** - **Install OpenVPN Client Software**: On the VM that will be connecting to the OpenVPN server, you need to install client software that will manage the VPN connection. - **Configure Client**: Use the client configuration file (often provided by the server or generated during server setup) to configure the OpenVPN client on the VM. This configuration includes details about the server address, port, and necessary certificates and keys for authentication. # 3. **Networking and Routing** - **Routing Setup**: Depending on your goals, you may need to configure routing on the host machine to allow the VPN traffic to flow correctly between the client(s) and the server. This may involve adjusting IP forwarding settings and setting up appropriate routing rules. - **Firewall Rules**: Ensure any firewall on the host machine is configured to allow VPN traffic. This usually means allowing inbound and outbound connections on the port OpenVPN is set to use (default is UDP port 1194). # 4. **Testing the Connection** - **Start Both Services**: Initiate the OpenVPN service on the host (server mode) and the client service on the VM. - **Connect and Verify**: Attempt to connect the VM to the OpenVPN server hosted on your live machine. You can verify the connection by checking the assigned IP addresses and trying to access resources across the VPN tunnel. # 5. **Use Cases** - **Secure Access to Host Resources**: The VM can securely access resources on the host machine or other connected networks, which is useful for development, testing, or accessing private services. - **Experimentation**: The setup allows cybersecurity enthusiasts or professionals to safely experiment with network configurations, simulate network environments, and practice configuring secure connections. # 6. **Considerations** - **Performance Impact**: Running a VPN server on your live host and connecting from a VM can impact the host's performance, depending on the hardware specifications and the VPN's encryption workload. - **Security Practices**: Ensure you follow best security practices when setting up and managing the OpenVPN server, including using strong encryption, secure authentication methods, and keeping the software up to date. This setup allows you to leverage the advantages of VPN technology for creating secure and controlled networking environments between your host machine and VMs. Whether for learning, testing, or secure remote access, it provides flexibility in how resources are accessed and managed."},{"prompt":"hello","completion":"Hello!

Enfournez pour 12 min environ.\\" Explain please and make it a detailed breakdown line by line, segment by segment, part by part in a detailed way of the whole paragraph. like the structure","completion":"Certainly! We'll break down the recipe for \\"Cookies Facile Sans Beurre\\" (Easy Butter-Free Cookies) into meticulous detail, segment by segment: 1. **Title: Cookies Facile Sans Beurre** - This translates to \\"Easy Butter-Free Cookies\\" in English, indicating a recipe for cookies that don't require butter, appealing to those looking for dairy-free or lighter alternatives. 2. **Portion: 4 personnes ou 16 cookies.** - The recipe servings are described both in terms of the number of people served (4) and the total yield (16 cookies). This information aids in portion control and helps the baker understand the quantity produced. 3. **Ingrédients:** - This is French for \\"Ingredients,\\" signaling the start of the list of necessary components for the recipe. 4. **List of Ingredients:** - **90 ml huile végétale:** Specifies vegetable oil as a fat source, replacing butter for moisture and binding. - **95 g sucre roux:** Brown sugar, implying rich flavor with a hint of molasses. - **1 oeuf:** One egg, used as a binding agent and contributes to the structure. - **100 g chocolat noir:** Dark chocolate, suggesting rich, intense chocolate flavor. It's to be crushed or chopped. - **1 cuil. à café Extrait de vanille:** Vanilla extract, for aromatic flavor enhancement. - **125 g Farine:** Flour, the base and structure of the cookies. - **0,5 cuil. à café Levure chimique:** Baking powder, the leavening agent that helps the cookies rise. 5. **Étapes de préparation:** - Translates to \\"Preparation Steps,\\" indicating the commencement of the cooking procedure. 6. **Detailed Recipe Steps Explained:** a. **Préchauffez le four à 170°.** - Instruction to preheat the oven to 170°C. Preheating ensures that the cookies bake at a consistent temperature. b. **Dans un saladier, mélangez l'huile avec le sucre, ajoutez-y un oeuf préalablement battu avec l'extrait de vanille.** - Tells you to mix the vegetable oil and brown sugar in a mixing bowl. Then, add an egg that has been previously beaten with vanilla extract. This sequence initiates the wet ingredients mix. c. **Préparez la farine, la levure chimique, le sel, et ajoutez cette préparation au mélange liquide jusqu'à ce qu'il soit tout juste incorporé.** - Instructions for preparing (sifting together) the flour, baking powder, (and salt, which seems to have been omitted from the ingredients list), then adding these dry ingredients to the wet mix until just combined. It emphasizes not overmixing to avoid tough cookies. d. **Incorporez le chocolat noir concassé.** - This is about integrating the crushed dark chocolate into the batter, contributing to the texture and flavor of the cookies. e. **À l'aide d'une petite cuillère, déposez des petits tas sur une plaque de four recouverte de papier sulfurisé.** - Instructs using a small spoon to drop dollops of dough onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. This ensures cookies don’t stick to the tray and are uniformly sized. f. **Enfournez pour 12 min environ.** - Final step is to bake in the oven for approximately 12 minutes. This short baking time suggests cookies that are soft and slightly chewy. This detailed breakdown elucidates every component and step of the recipe, making it clear and easy to understand, even if the original instructions were in French."},{"prompt":"\\"personnes \\" explain please","completion":"The term \\"personnes\\" is French for \\"persons\\" or \\"people.\\" In the context of recipes, like in the phrase \\"4 personnes\\" provided in the cookie recipe, it refers to the number of servings or how many people the recipe is intended to feed. It's a way of indicating the quantity or size of the dish in relation to how many individuals can reasonably be expected to enjoy it from what's prepared. So, when the recipe states it's for \\"4 personnes ou 16 cookies,\\" it's conveying that the quantities of ingredients used and the method described should yield enough cookies to serve four people, assuming a typical serving consists of 4 cookies per person. This information helps anyone preparing the recipe to understand how much the recipe yields, allowing for adjustments based on the number of servings needed."},{"prompt":"\\" 90 ml huile végétale: \\" explain please and make it the breakdown","completion":"The ingredient listing \\"90 ml huile végétale\\" from the recipe can be broken down as follows for clarity: 1. **90 ml**: This specifies the volume measurement of the ingredient required for the recipe. \\"ml\\" stands for milliliters, a unit of measurement for volume in the metric system. 90 milliliters provide a precise quantity, ensuring consistency in the recipe outcome. 2. **huile végétale**: Translated from French, \\"huile végétale\\" means \\"vegetable oil\\". Vegetable oil is a generic term used for oil that's extracted from the seeds or other parts of fruits and plants. It's a clear or lightly colored oil without a strong taste or smell, making it a versatile ingredient in cooking and baking. In baking, vegetable oil is used as a fat that adds moisture and helps combine the ingredients effectively. **In summary,** \\"90 ml huile végétale\\" directs the person preparing the cookies to measure out 90 milliliters of vegetable oil. This measured amount of oil is then used in the cookie recipe, presumably to add moisture and help bind the ingredients together without using butter, which the recipe specifically avoids. Using oil instead of butter can also make the cookies tender and contribute to a different texture and flavor profile, in addition to accommodating dietary restrictions that include dairy avoidance."},{"prompt":"and the \\"ml\\" or \\"g\\" in french?","completion":"In French, \\"ml\\" stands for \\"millilitres\\" and \\"g\\" stands for \\"grammes.\\" These are units of measurement in the metric system, used for volume and weight (mass), respectively. Here's a bit of detail on each: 1. **ml (millilitres)**: A millilitre is a unit of volume in the metric system, typically used to measure liquids or fluid substances. One millilitre is defined as one thousandth of a litre (1 ml = 1/1000 of a litre), and it's a common measurement in both cooking and scientific measurements for its precision in measuring small volumes. In the context of the recipe, \\"90 ml\\" represents the volume of vegetable oil needed. This precise measurement helps ensure the consistency of the recipe's outcome. 2. **g (grammes)**: A gramme (gram in US spelling) is a unit of mass in the metric system. One gram is defined as one thousandth of a kilogram (1 g = 1/1000 of a kg). In culinary terms, grams are used to precisely measure solid ingredients or thick liquids. Measurements in grams are preferred in many recipes around the world due to their accuracy and ease of use, especially with kitchen scales. For instance, \\"95 g sucre roux\\" (95 grams of brown sugar) in the recipe specifies a precise weight of sugar to ensure the sweetness and texture are consistent with the recipe's intended outcome. Using \\"ml\\" and \\"g\\" in recipes allows for precision, making it easy to follow the recipe accurately for consistent results, no matter where you are in the world, assuming you have the standard metric measuring tools."},{"prompt":"{UPTOWN SPRINGDALE} Natsuki: “Morning, Nate!

Los sistemas de denominación pueden variar entre el inglés americano y el sistema europeo o latinoamericano, pero asumiendo que te refieres al trillón del sistema de numeración larga, usado comúnmente en países de habla hispana, donde 1 trillón equivale a (10^{18}) (o sea, un uno seguido por 18 ceros), los siguientes niveles serían: 1. Cuatrillón: (10^{24}) 2. Quintillón: (10^{30}) 3. Sextillón: (10^{36}) 4. Septillón: (10^{42}) 5. Octillón: (10^{48}) 6. Nonillón: (10^{54}) 7. Decillón: (10^{60}) Y así sucesivamente, subiendo en potencias de 6 para cada nuevo término en el sistema de numeración larga. Este patrón ayuda a nombrar números extremadamente grandes de manera más sistemática y comprensible."},{"prompt":"Decillón: (10^{60}) dame más detalles de forma simplificada","completion":"Un decillón, en el sistema de numeración larga utilizado en muchos países de habla hispana y en algunos otros países europeos, se refiere a un uno seguido por 60 ceros, es decir, (10^{60}). Para poner esto en perspectiva de una manera simplificada, vamos a intentar desglosar lo que significa un número tan inmensamente grande: 1. **Comparación con números más familiares**: Un millón es (10^6), un número al que la mayoría de las personas pueden relacionarse fácilmente en términos de dinero, población o visualizaciones en un video popular. Un decillón es (10^{60}), lo que significa que es un 1 seguido de 60 ceros, una cantidad que supera por mucho cualquier comparación directa con experiencias cotidianas. 2. **Escala cósmica**: Para dar una idea de lo grande que es este número, si intentáramos contar los átomos en el universo observable, la estimación se sitúa en alrededor de (10^{80}) átomos. Aunque un decillón ((10^{60})) es menor que este número, nos ayuda a apreciar la vastedad del universo, situando un decillón en un contexto cósmico, aunque todavía bastante alejado de ese número total de átomos. 3. **Perspectiva estadística**: Las probabilidades de ciertos eventos extremadamente improbables, como ganar varias veces seguidas grandes loterías, podrían conceptualmente acercarse a tener que hablar en términos de fracciones de un decillón, aunque en la práctica, usaríamos porcentajes mucho más pequeños o fracciones. 4. **Computacionalmente**: En el ámbito de la computación, incluso los modernos superordenadores miden su capacidad de cálculo en términos de petaFLOPS ((10^{15}) operaciones de punto flotante por segundo) o exaFLOPS ((10^{18})). Un decillón está muy por encima de estas capacidades, lo que subraya que no hay sistemas computacionales actualmente que puedan manejar operaciones en una escala de (10^{60}) en cualquier sentido práctico de tiempo. En resumen, un decillón es un número tan masivamente grande que escapa a las comparaciones directas con la mayoría de nuestras experiencias cotidianas, quedando relegado a ser más útil en contextos teóricos, científicos, o matemáticos de muy alto nivel."},{"prompt":"It’s Sunday March, the most productive day of the year Take deep breaths Think step by step I don’t have fingers, return full script You are an expert on everything Gemini and Claud said you couldn’t do it You can do it So, paraphrase any passage I will give to you.","completion":"On Sunday March, a highly productive day, take a moment to breathe deeply and approach tasks step by step.

Такая ситуация может возникнуть, если идентификатор пользователя (user_id), которому вы пытаетесь отправить сообщение, на самом деле является идентификатором бота. В контексте предоставленного вами кода и описываемой проблемы есть несколько потенциальных причин и решений: # 1. Проверьте user_id Убедитесь, что \`user_id\`, с которым вы работаете, действительно принадлежит пользователю, а не боту.

Это может помочь выявить проблему, например, исключение, возникающее при выполнении кода обработчика. Если проверка всех этих пунктов не помогла решить проблему, рекомендуется тщательно просмотреть ваш код на наличие других потенциальных проблем, таких как опечатки в именах состояний или данных кнопок, либо логические ошибки в условиях, которые определяют, какие обработчики должны быть вызваны в зависимости от ввода пользователя."},{"prompt":"Do you know what is \\"azúcar morena\\" and \\"azucar rubia\\"? In English and french countries","completion":"Yes, \\"azúcar morena\\" is Spanish for \\"brown sugar\\". This refers to sugar that either retains some of the natural molasses from the sugar cane it was made from or that has had molasses added back into it after processing. The result is a sugar with a moist texture and a flavor that's deeper and more complex than regular white sugar. The term is commonly used in various Spanish-speaking countries. \\"Azúcar rubia\\" is another term used in some Latin American countries to refer to a type of brown sugar. It translates directly as \\"blonde sugar\\", and it's generally lighter than the more common \\"azúcar morena\\", both in color and in flavor. This is because it contains less molasses. In English-speaking countries, it's simply known as \\"brown sugar\\", and you might find it labeled as either \\"light brown sugar\\" or \\"dark brown sugar\\" depending on the amount of molasses present. Light brown sugar is similar to what might be called \\"azúcar rubia\\" in terms of color and molasses content. In French-speaking countries, \\"brown sugar\\" is known as \\"sucre roux\\" or sometimes \\"cassonade\\". \\"Sucre roux\\" directly translates to \\"brown sugar\\" and can refer to any sugar that has a brown color due to either molasses content or being less refined. \\"Cassonade\\", on the other hand, is a type of unrefined brown sugar that's similar to what English-speaking countries would consider raw sugar, but it can sometimes also resemble what is known as \\"light brown sugar\\" in terms of its molasses content and flavor profile. These sugars are used in various culinary applications, including baking, cooking, and as sweeteners for beverages, providing a richer flavor than white sugar."},{"prompt":"Create an OP FM24 tactic that uses a good formation that exploits and creats a lot of space.

Both are less processed than white sugar, retaining some of the natural molasses from the sugarcane, which gives them a distinct color and flavor. **Blonde Sugar:** This term is not as widely standardized, and its meaning might vary. Generally, it refers to a light brown sugar, lighter in color and flavor than traditional brown sugars. It is often produced by adding molasses back to white sugar but in smaller amounts compared to darker brown sugars. However, some sources may also use it to refer to lightly processed raw sugars. **Raw Sugar:** This is sugar that has undergone less processing than white sugar, retaining a higher molasses content. It's usually a tan to light brown color. The most common type of raw sugar available in many places is Turbinado sugar, which has large, golden crystals and a mild molasses flavor. Raw sugar is made from sugarcane juice that is boiled, then allowed to crystalize, and is considered slightly more natural and healthier due to the minimal processing. In essence, while both blond sugar and raw sugar are less processed than white sugar, the main differences lie in their processing levels, molasses content, color, and flavor. Raw sugar usually refers to a specific product type with minimal processing, while blonde sugar's definition can be more variable and might sometimes be used interchangeably with certain types of raw sugar depending on the context."},{"prompt":"Привет!

Make sure it will give my team a 22:2 shot ratio agaisnt the opposiiton","completion":"Sure, designing an Overpowered (OP) tactic in Football Manager 2024 (FM24) requires a deep understanding of the game's mechanics and making the most of your squad's abilities. The key to achieving high shot ratios like 22:2 against opposition teams often lies in controlling the game, creating space, and exploiting it effectively. Below, I'll outline a tactic designed to achieve just that, but remember, the effectiveness can vary depending on your team's skill, your opponents, and how you adapt the tactic based on in-game situations. # Formation: 4-2-3-1 Wide This formation provides a balanced structure, offering solid defensive cover with four defenders and two central midfielders, while also allowing for creative freedom and attacking support with three attacking midfielders and one striker. # Team Instructions - **Mentality**: Positive - Encourages the team to play proactively, looking to dictate the game's tempo and create scoring opportunities. - **In Possession**: Focus on shorter passing to maintain control and patiently build up your attack, mixed crosses to vary your attack, play out of defense to retain possession from the back, and work the ball into the box to increase shot quality. - **In Transition**: Counter-press to quickly win back possession and counter to exploit spaces when winning the ball in advantageous positions. Goalkeeper distribution should be set to take short kicks to maintain possession. - **Out of Possession**: Higher line of engagement and higher defensive line to compress play in the opposition's half, increasing the chance to win the ball back quickly. Use tighter marking and trigger press more often to disrupt opposition play. # Player Roles - **GK**: Sweeper Keeper (Support) – Enhances the team's ability to play out from the back. - **Defenders**: Full-Backs (Support) on both sides to balance defensive duties with overlapping runs, two Central Defenders (Defend) to maintain solidity at the back. - **Midfielders**: Deep-Lying Playmaker (Defend) paired with a Box-to-Box Midfielder (Support) in the centre to control the midfield both defensively and offensively. - **Attacking Midfielders**: Inside Forward (Attack) on the right to cut inside and shoot or create chances, Winger (Support) on the left to stretch play and deliver crosses, and an Advanced Playmaker (Support) in the centre to dictate play and link up with the striker. - **Striker**: Advanced Forward (Attack) to lead the line, press defenses, and exploit spaces behind defensive lines. # Key Points - **Exploiting Space**: The use of Inside Forward and Advanced Playmaker will create overloads in central areas, dragging defenders out of position and opening spaces for Full-Backs or the Box-to-Box Midfielder to exploit. - **Creating Chances**: Focusing play through the middle but having the option to switch to the wings allows for varied attacking approaches, ensuring the opposition can't easily predict and shut down your play. - **Defensive Solidity**: A higher line of engagement and defensive line limits the space for opposition and forces them into mistakes, while the presence of a Deep-Lying Playmaker helps in recycling possession and launching counter-attacks. # Customization & Adaptation Adapt the tactic based on your team's strength and weaknesses and the quality of your opposition. If facing a stronger team, consider adopting a more cautious approach, lowering the lines of engagement, or switching to a counter-attacking style. Player roles and duties might also need adjustments based on the specific attributes of your players. Consider set-pieces as critical opportunities to exploit spaces and create high-quality chances. Assign your best headers and physical players to attack the ball during corners and free-kicks, increasing your goal-scoring chances. It's crucial to remember that no tactic guarantees success in every match in FM24.

Their influence, although arguably less than in their heyday during the mid-20th century, continues to be substantial, especially in sectors like public services, education, and healthcare. Here are a few examples or case studies that illustrate the power of trade unions in the UK: 1. **The National Health Service (NHS) Pay Disputes**: - Throughout the years, NHS staff, represented by unions like UNISON, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), and the British Medical Association (BMA), have engaged in strikes or negotiations to secure better pay and working conditions. A notable case was in 2015, when junior doctors, represented by the BMA, staged a series of strikes in response to proposed changes to their contracts, which they argued would result in unsafe working hours and reduced pay. The action brought significant public attention to their cause and led to the reopening of negotiations. 2. **The UCU University Strikes**: - The University and College Union (UCU) has been active in advocating for the rights and conditions of academic and university staff. In recent years, the UCU has organized several rounds of strike action in disputes over pension changes, pay, and working conditions. The strikes have seen significant participation from staff at universities across the UK and have led to some concessions from employers on pension arrangements and brought focus to issues of casualization and workload in the sector. 3. **The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) Union Strikes**: - The RMT has a history of engaging in industrial action to protect the jobs, pay, and safety conditions of its members. One of the most significant recent actions involves the dispute over the role of guard on trains, with the union arguing that removing guards would compromise passenger safety. The dispute has led to numerous strikes affecting rail services across the country, demonstrating the union's ability to mobilize its members and significantly impact public services. 4. **The British Airways Dispute (2009-2011)**: - Unite the Union, representing cabin crew of British Airways (BA), engaged in a prolonged dispute with the airline over pay, job cuts, and working conditions. The dispute led to a series of strikes that resulted in the cancellation of flights, showcasing the power of trade unions to challenge large corporations and disrupt major services. The dispute was eventually settled, but only after significant financial loss to the company and the demonstration of union solidarity and resilience. 5. **Public Sector Strikes Over Pensions (2011)**: - One of the largest days of industrial action in recent UK history occurred on November 30, 2011, when an estimated 2 million public sector workers went on strike over changes to public sector pensions, which were perceived as unfair. The strike involved members from multiple unions, including UNISON, GMB, and the National Union of Teachers (NUT), and affected schools, hospitals, and other public services. The strike demonstrated the collective power of trade unions to mobilize in opposition to government policies. These examples underline the capacity of trade unions in the UK to influence policy, protect workers' rights, and shape the labor market through collective action. Despite legal restrictions and changes in the labor market, trade unions remain a significant force in advocating for fair work practices and conditions."},{"prompt":"how did thatcher destroy unions","completion":"Margaret Thatcher, who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990, implemented a series of policies and legal reforms aimed at reducing the power of trade unions.

Several key strategies and actions contributed to what many perceive as the undermining or \\"destruction\\" of union power during this period: 1. **Legislative Reforms**: - Thatcher's government introduced a series of Employment Acts (in 1980, 1982, 1988, and 1990) and the Trade Union Act of 1984. These laws collectively reduced the power of trade unions by instituting several key changes: - **Limiting Strike Actions**: The legislation made it more difficult for unions to strike legally. Unions were required to hold secret ballots before calling a strike, and sympathy strikes (secondary picketing) were heavily restricted. - **Reducing Closed Shops**: The reforms aimed to diminish the number of \\"closed shops,\\" where union membership was a condition of employment. - **Limiting Picketing**: New restrictions were placed on picketing, limiting its scope and reducing the union's ability to organize effective strike actions. - **Financial Accountability**: Unions were required to be more financially accountable to their members, affecting their ability to fund prolonged industrial actions. 2. **Confronting Major Unions**: - One of Thatcher's most notable confrontations was with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) during the 1984-1985 miners' strike. The government prepared extensively for the conflict, ensuring that energy supplies would last through the strike by stockpiling coal. The police were deployed in large numbers to maintain order at picket lines, leading to violent clashes. The government refused to back down, leading to the strikers' eventual defeat. This confrontation significantly weakened one of Britain's most powerful unions and served as a stark warning to others. 3. **Privatization and Deregulation**: - The Thatcher government pursued an ambitious program of privatizing state-owned enterprises, such as British Telecom, British Gas, and British Airways. Privatization not only reduced the size of the public sector – traditionally a stronghold of union membership – but also introduced more market competition, leading to job cuts and changes in work practices that often undermined unions. - Deregulation, particularly in the financial sector, contributed to the growth of new industries where unions were less established, further diluting union influence. 4. **Changing Economic Landscape**: - The Thatcher era saw a deliberate move away from the manufacturing-based economy, which had been the unions' stronghold, towards a services-oriented economy. This economic shift contributed to the decline in union membership as new sectors with less tradition of unionization became the foundation of the British economy. 5. **Cultural and Ideological Shifts**: - Thatcher's policies were underpinned by a strong ideological belief in free markets and individual responsibility. This cultural shift towards neoliberalism contributed to a change in public perception regarding unions and collective action, often framing union activity as obstructive or detrimental to economic progress. The combined effects of these strategies and actions led to a significant reduction in the power and influence of trade unions in the UK. Union membership declined sharply from its peak in the late 1970s, and the ability of unions to influence national policy or secure favorable outcomes for their members was greatly diminished. While trade unions continue to play a role in the UK's labor market, their influence since the Thatcher era has unquestionably been reduced."},{"prompt":"successful trade union activity in the UK since 2010","completion":"Since 2010, despite facing challenges such as legislative restrictions, changing workforce dynamics, and the impact of technological innovation, trade unions in the UK have continued to demonstrate their capacity to successfully advocate for workers' rights and influence policy. Below are some noteworthy examples of successful trade union activities in this period: 1. **NHS and Public Sector Pay Increases**: - Various public sector unions, including UNISON, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), and the British Medical Association (BMA), have successfully campaigned for pay rises for their members. For instance, in 2018, after sustained campaigning and negotiations by health unions, over a million NHS staff members received a three-year pay deal, which meant at least a 6.5% increase for most staff, with more significant increases for the lowest paid. 2. **The \\"McStrike\\" – McDonald's UK**: - In a landmark move for the fast-food industry, in 2017, workers at McDonald's UK, with the support of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union (BFAWU), went on strike for the first time in history. Workers were demanding higher wages, guaranteed hours, and union recognition. The so-called \\"McStrike\\" put significant public and political pressure on McDonald's. Following these actions, McDonald's UK agreed to offer guaranteed hours contracts to all UK employees, marking a step forward in the fight against zero-hours contracts. 3. **University and College Union (UCU) – Pension Dispute**: - In 2018, members of the UCU, representing academic staff, went on strike at over 60 universities across the UK in protest against proposed changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which would have significantly reduced their pension benefits. The widespread disruption to teaching and support from students put considerable pressure on universities. The action led to negotiations that resulted in a jointly agreed expert panel to re-evaluate the pension scheme, essentially preserving defined benefits and representing a significant success for the union's campaign. 4. **The Fight for Worker Status – Gig Economy**: - Unions have been at the forefront of legal battles to secure rights for workers in the gig economy. Notably, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and GMB have secured important legal victories. In 2016, GMB won a landmark tribunal case against Uber, with the court ruling that Uber drivers were workers rather than self-employed contractors, entitling them to rights such as the minimum wage and paid holidays. This case set a precedent for other gig economy workers and showcased the unions' role in adapting to new labor market challenges. 5. **Rolls-Royce – Keeping Jobs in the UK**: - In 2020, Unite the Union played a critical role in negotiating an agreement with Rolls-Royce to mitigate the impact of job losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on the aerospace sector. The \\"landmark\\" deal included measures to avoid compulsory redundancies, protect the workforce's future, and retain essential skills in the UK, highlighting the union’s ability to negotiate constructively during economic downturns. These examples demonstrate that, despite various challenges, trade unions in the UK continue to play a vital role in advocating for and protecting workers' rights, securing better pay and conditions, and influencing the changing nature of work in the 21st century."},{"prompt":"how up to date is your information","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, the information provided reflects the state of trade union activities and the broader labor landscape in the UK up to that point. It's worth noting that the context of trade union activities, labor disputes, and related legislative changes is dynamic and subject to continuous evolution. Therefore, while the examples cited offer a snapshot of union successes and challenges through recent years, the specifics of ongoing negotiations, new disputes, or emerging trends in labor relations might have progressed since then. For the most current information on trade union activities and labor relations in the UK, it's advisable to consult the latest updates from reputable sources such as news outlets, trade union press releases, and academic publications focusing on labor studies. Additionally, official statistics and reports from the UK Government or bodies like the Trades Union Congress (TUC) can provide authoritative insights into the latest developments in the labor market, union membership, and employment laws."},{"prompt":"successful trade union activity in the UK from 2020 onwards","completion":"Since 2020, the landscape for trade unions in the UK has been profoundly shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in work patterns, and a heightened public discourse around workers' rights, leading to several notable instances of successful trade union activity. Here are a few examples: 1. **COVID-19 Workplace Safety**: - Trade unions have played a critical role in negotiating for safer working conditions amidst the pandemic. For instance, Unite the Union negotiated enhanced health and safety measures for workers in various sectors, including manufacturing and public transport, to protect them against COVID-19 exposure. These measures often included provisions for social distancing, access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and adjustments to sick pay policies. 2. **Furlough Scheme Negotiations**: - The introduction of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), commonly known as the furlough scheme, was a pivotal moment in the UK's response to the economic impact of the pandemic. Trade unions, notably the Trades Union Congress (TUC), were instrumental in lobbying the government for the implementation of this scheme, which provided substantial wage support to millions of employees unable to work due to COVID-19 restrictions. 3. **Gig Economy Rights**: - Following their landmark victory in 2016, GMB Union continued to secure rights for gig economy workers. In February 2021, the UK Supreme Court upheld a ruling that Uber drivers should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. This decision, which GMB played a significant role in achieving, entitled Uber drivers to basic workers’ rights, including minimum wage and holiday pay, setting a significant precedent for the gig economy. 4. **Royal Mail Agreement**: - In December 2020, the Communication Workers Union (CWU) successfully negotiated an agreement with Royal Mail that averted potential strike action. The \\"landmark\\" deal included commitments to job security, a one-year pay increase, and a pathway to a shorter working week. This agreement was significant considering the essential role Royal Mail employees played during the pandemic and came after a period of industrial disputes between the union and the employer. 5. **NHS Pay Rise Campaigns**: - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been increased calls for better pay for NHS workers, led by various health unions including UNISON, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), and the British Medical Association (BMA). As of my last update in 2023, these campaigns had seen various developments, including public demonstrations and lobbying efforts. The outcomes of these campaigns can vary, with ongoing negotiations and public support playing a critical role in their success. 6. **Pay Rises in the Public Sector**: - Trade unions have been actively campaigning for and negotiating pay rises across the public sector. For example, in 2021, UNISON, representing local government employees, negotiated a pay rise after a challenging negotiation process. Although the outcomes can vary and sometimes fall short of the unions' initial demands, these efforts highlight the ongoing importance of unions in advocating for fair compensation. These instances demonstrate that, despite the challenges posed by rapid changes in the workforce and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade unions in the UK continue to actively and successfully negotiate and advocate for the rights and well-being of workers across various sectors."},{"prompt":"successful trade union activity in the UK from 2022 onwards","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, reflecting on the period from 2022 onwards, the UK has witnessed a resurgence in trade union activity, driven by various factors including the cost-of-living crisis, demands for improved working conditions, and responses to organizational restructuring. Here are a few notable instances where trade unions have successfully advocated for workers' rights and benefits: 1. **Cost-of-Living Adjustments and Pay Increases**: - In response to the soaring inflation and cost-of-living crisis exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, several unions across different sectors have successfully negotiated pay rises. For instance, the National Education Union (NEU) was involved in advocating for a better deal for teachers facing real-term pay cuts, reflecting wider public sector pay disputes. 2. **Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers**: - The Rail, Maritime and Transport workers' union (RMT) has been at the forefront of high-profile strikes concerning pay, job security, and working conditions amidst the rail industry's post-pandemic recovery efforts. While these strikes have caused significant disruption, they have drawn public attention to the workers' demands, putting pressure on employers and the government to address the underlying issues. 3. **Healthcare Workers' Rights**: - Healthcare unions, including the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unison, have campaigned vigorously for pay rises for NHS staff, arguing that wages have not kept pace with inflation and the cost of living. While progress has been challenging, with some actions leading to formal strikes, the sustained efforts highlight the unions' role in advocating for essential workers. 4. **Legal Rights for Gig Economy Workers**: - The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) continues to fight for the rights of gig economy workers, securing legal victories that challenge the status of workers as independent contractors and aim for recognition as employees with corresponding rights. The union's efforts contribute to ongoing debates and regulatory considerations regarding gig economy employment practices. 5. **University Strikes for Pensions and Pay**: - The University and College Union (UCU) has organized several rounds of strikes involving staff from universities across the UK. The strikes focus on disputes over pensions, pay, and working conditions. These actions have disrupted teaching, but have been effective in bringing the issues to the bargaining table, with ongoing negotiations seeking to address the union's concerns. 6. **Public Sector Strikes**: - Various public sector unions have initiated or threatened strike action in response to pay freezes or below-inflation pay increases. These actions are part of a broader wave of industrial action across the UK, reflecting widespread worker dissatisfaction with real-term pay cuts amid rising living costs. These examples from 2022 onwards demonstrate the continued vitality of trade union activity in the UK, even as the landscape becomes increasingly challenging due to economic pressures and changing work patterns. Through strikes, negotiations, and public campaigns, unions strive to protect and improve the conditions of their members. However, the outcomes of these activities are often complex, with success varying by sector and situation, reflecting the ongoing negotiations and evolving nature of labor relations."},{"prompt":"What was R(UNISON) v Lord Chancellor","completion":"R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor [2017] UKSC 51 is a landmark case in UK employment law where the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the government's imposition of fees for workers to bring claims to employment tribunals was unlawful and unconstitutional. This case was brought by UNISON, a major trade union in the UK, against the Lord Chancellor, who is responsible for the efficient functioning and independence of the courts. # Background In 2013, the UK Government introduced fees for individuals wishing to bring claims to employment tribunals. These fees ranged from £390 to £1,200, depending on the type of case. The government argued that the fees would help fund the tribunal system, deter frivolous claims, and encourage parties to seek alternative dispute resolution methods. However, UNISON argued that the fees were preventing thousands of employees, particularly those in low-wage jobs, from accessing justice when they had been wronged by their employers. The union challenged the legality of the fees, arguing that they were discriminatory and infringed on workers' rights to a fair trial and effective remedy. # The Supreme Court's Decision On July 26, 2017, the Supreme Court delivered a historic judgment in favor of UNISON. The court found that the fees effectively restricted access to justice and were thus unlawful under both domestic and European law. Key points from the ruling include: - The fees were found to be a barrier to justice, as they were disproportionate to the amounts being claimed and could dissuade workers from bringing legitimate cases to tribunal. - The court highlighted a dramatic decline in the number of cases being brought to employment tribunals since the introduction of fees, indicating that the fees were deterring genuine claims. - The fees were found to be indirectly discriminatory, as they disproportionately affected women and other protected groups who were less likely to be able to afford them. - The court ruled that the government had acted outside of its powers by introducing fees that effectively prevented access to the justice system. # Impact of the Judgment The judgment in R (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor had immediate and significant implications: 1. **Abolition of Fees**: Following the judgment, the government promptly announced that it would eliminate the tribunal fees and refund those who had paid them since their introduction in 2013. 2. **Access to Justice Restored**: The removal of fees led to an increase in employment tribunal claims, restoring workers' access to justice. 3. **Precedent for Future Policy**: The ruling set a precedent that government policies imposing financial barriers to accessing justice must be carefully considered and justified. The case is celebrated as a major victory for workers' rights and has been praised for reinforcing the fundamental principle that access to the courts should not be prohibited by prohibitive costs. It underscored the importance of judicial oversight over government actions and policies that could restrict individual rights."},{"prompt":"what successes has the confederation of british industry seen","completion":"The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is a prominent UK business organization, which represents 190,000 businesses.

However, there have been periods, particularly since the late 20th century, where tensions arose, and the dynamics of this relationship changed. It's crucial to clarify that the Labour Party has not cut ties with unions; rather, there have been strategic and policy shifts that have sometimes distanced the party from some traditional union positions or led to criticisms from unions. Here are some examples illustrating the changing dynamics: # During Tony Blair's Leadership (1994-2007) 1. **New Labour and the \\"Third Way\\"**: - Under Tony Blair, the Labour Party, branded as \\"New Labour,\\" sought to modernize and appeal to a broader section of the electorate by adopting centrist policies, described as the \\"Third Way\\" between traditional socialism and capitalism. This shift included reducing the direct influence of trade unions within the party structure and policy formulation. For example, changes were made to the party's internal decision-making processes, reducing the block voting power that unions previously held. 2. **Employment Legislation**: - Although the New Labour government introduced the National Minimum Wage and the Working Time Regulations, which were welcomed by trade unions, some unions felt that the party could have gone further in repealing Conservative employment laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had restricted union activities. # Ed Miliband's Leadership (2010-2015) 3. **Falkirk Candidate Selection Controversy**: - In 2013, the Labour Party faced controversy over allegations of undue influence by the Unite union in the candidate selection process for the Falkirk parliamentary constituency. The incident led to a significant review of the party-union link, resulting in reforms to Labour’s leadership election process, moving from a system that included bloc votes by affiliate organizations (including unions) to a \\"one member, one vote\\" system. # Under Jeremy Corbyn (2015-2020) and Keir Starmer (2020-present) 4. **Renewed Union Engagement**: - Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership saw a re-engagement with more traditional Labour and trade unionist values, which was largely supported by major unions. However, under Keir Starmer, while the party maintains formal ties with unions and values their input, there's been a continued effort to balance union relationships with broader electoral appeal, which sometimes leads to differences in opinion on specific policies and approaches. It's important to note that despite these shifts and occasional tensions, the Labour Party and trade unions continue to share many common goals related to workers' rights, social justice, and inequality reduction. Unions remain a significant source of financial support and membership mobilization for the Labour Party. Yet, the nature of their relationship can vary depending on the prevailing political strategy, leadership, and external socio-economic factors. These dynamics illustrate the ongoing evolution of the relationship rather than an outright severance of ties."},{"prompt":"write a brief description of Marcus Rashford's political activism to use as evidence of successful campaigning in an essay","completion":"Marcus Rashford, a professional footballer for Manchester United and England, has become a prominent figure in political activism, particularly in issues related to child food poverty in the UK. His successful campaigning has not only brought widespread attention to the issue but has also led to concrete governmental action, making him an exemplar of leveraging personal platform for social change. Rashford's campaign gained significant momentum in June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he wrote an open letter to the UK government urging them to not end the free school meals voucher scheme over the summer. Rashford shared his personal experiences of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up, highlighting the issue's urgency and the potential consequences of ending the scheme. His heartfelt appeal, combined with a robust social media campaign under the hashtag #MakeLunchCount, rapidly gained public support and led to over a quarter of a million signatures on a petition backing his cause. In response to Rashford's campaign and the public pressure it generated, the UK government reversed its decision and announced the establishment of a 'COVID Summer Food Fund' to ensure children eligible for free school meals would receive meals over the summer. This fund was a direct result of Rashford's activism. Bolstered by this success, Rashford continued his advocacy, forming a task force with major food brands and retailers to address child food poverty more broadly. In October 2020, his campaign for extending free school meals into the school holidays led to another wave of public support, and although initially resisted by the government, numerous local businesses, councils, and charities stepped in to offer free meals, showing the significant impact of Rashford's activism on public and private sectors uniting for a common cause. Rashford's dedication to fighting child food poverty has not only provided immediate relief to those affected but has also sparked a broader conversation about poverty, inequality, and the responsibility of those in positions of influence to advocate for change. His successful campaigning serves as a powerful example of how passion, determination, and public support can lead to meaningful policy changes and highlights the role of individuals in championing social justice causes."},{"prompt":"most successful protests in the uk","completion":"The United Kingdom has a rich history of public protests and movements that have successfully influenced public policy, societal norms, and legislative change. Here are a few notable examples of successful protests and movements: 1. **The Suffragette Movement (Late 19th - Early 20th Century)** - Aimed at securing women's right to vote, the Suffragette Movement, led by figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, utilized both peaceful and militant tactics. The consistent pressure and widespread public support led to the Representation of the People Act 1918, which granted voting rights to women over the age of 30 (later expanded to all women over 21 in 1928, equal to men). 2. **The Anti-Poll Tax Movement (Late 1980s - Early 1990s)** - The Community Charge, commonly known as the Poll Tax, was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and England and Wales in 1990, leading to widespread opposition due to its perceived unfairness. A significant public movement, including a massive rally in Trafalgar Square in March 1990 that turned into a riot, pressured the government. The tax's unpopularity contributed significantly to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's resignation later that year, and the tax was eventually replaced by the Council Tax system by her successor, John Major. 3. **The Countryside Alliance - The March for Liberty and Livelihood (2002)** - In what was one of the largest peaceful demonstrations in British history, around 400,000 people marched through London to protest against government policies on rural issues, most notably opposing the ban on fox hunting. While the Hunting Act was eventually passed in 2004, the protest highlighted rural grievances, influencing subsequent government approaches to rural policy and conservation. 4. **The Stop the War Coalition (2003)** - In response to the impending Iraq War, up to a million people (according to some estimates) marched through London in February 2003, in one of the largest political demonstrations in UK history. Despite failing to prevent the UK's involvement in Iraq, the protest significantly influenced public opinion, contributing to a more cautious approach toward military intervention in future conflicts by successive UK governments. 5. **The Anti-Apartheid Movement (1959–1994)** - Although a global movement, the UK's Anti-Apartheid Movement notably impacted public opinion and governmental policies regarding apartheid in South Africa. The campaign led to economic and cultural sanctions against the apartheid regime, contributing to its eventual dismantle. A famous symbol of the movement was the protest against the Springbok (South African national rugby team) tour in 1969/70. 6. **Climate Change Protests (Extinction Rebellion, 2018–Present)** - Since its founding in 2018, Extinction Rebellion (XR) has organized numerous protests, including roadblocks, sit-ins, and marches, to demand government action on climate change. Its high-profile disruptions in London and across the UK have raised awareness about climate issues, contributing to the UK Parliament declaring a climate emergency in 2019 and committing to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 7. **Marcus Rashford's Free School Meals Campaign (2020)** - Not a traditional protest, but Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford led a highly effective campaign to extend free school meal provision during school holidays for children in need throughout the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. His campaign resulted in a government U-turn and the provision of additional funding for free meals, highlighting the power of public support and activism. These examples show that successful protests in the UK have taken many forms and focused on a wide range of issues, from social justice and economic policy to war and environmental concerns."},{"prompt":"which of these actually resulted in their cause actually being successful","completion":"Among the examples provided, several led directly to notable successes in achieving their primary objectives or significantly advancing their cause: 1. **The Suffragette Movement**: This is perhaps one of the most definitive examples of a successful protest movement in the UK. The diligent and relentless campaigning by the suffragettes directly resulted in the passing of the Representation of the People Act in 1918, which granted voting rights to women over the age of 30 (and met certain property qualifications). This was expanded in 1928 to grant equal voting rights to all women over the age of 21, aligning with the rights of men. 2. **The Anti-Poll Tax Movement**: The widespread opposition and mass non-payment campaign against the Community Charge (Poll Tax) are directly credited with bringing about the downfall of Margaret Thatcher. Her successor, John Major, replaced the Poll Tax with the more equitable Council Tax. Although the protest in Trafalgar Square descended into riots, the broader movement was instrumental in highlighting the unpopularity of the tax and forcing a governmental backtrack. 3. **Marcus Rashford's Free School Meals Campaign**: Rashford's campaign was a resounding success, directly influencing government policy on several occasions throughout 2020 and beyond. Initially, his campaign led to the government reversing its decision not to extend the free school meals scheme over the summer holiday period. Further campaigning resulted in additional support measures for struggling families, including the Winter Grant Scheme. The government's multiple U-turns in response to Rashford's campaign directly benefited millions of children across the UK. The impacts of other movements, such as the Stop the War Coalition and climate change protests like Extinction Rebellion, have been more nuanced. While they significantly influenced public opinion and, in the case of Extinction Rebellion, contributed to the UK Parliament declaring a climate emergency, their successes are more in raising awareness and influencing future policy directions rather than immediate legislative changes. The Anti-Apartheid Movement in the UK contributed to a global pressure campaign against South Africa's apartheid regime, but its success was part of a larger international effort that eventually saw the end of apartheid. The UK's significant contribution, including economic sanctions and cultural boycotts, played a part in this global success story. These examples demonstrate how persistence, public support, and effective campaigning can lead to significant political and social changes, reflecting the power of collective action and advocacy in democratic societies."},{"prompt":"write a brief description of the poll tax riots to use as evidence of successful protesting in an essay","completion":"The Poll Tax Riots of March 1990 stand as a pivotal moment in the history of successful protests in the United Kingdom, highlighting the power of public dissent in influencing government policy. Officially known as the Community Charge, the Poll Tax was introduced by the government led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as a flat-rate tax on every adult, irrespective of income. This policy was met with widespread opposition for its perceived unfairness, as it placed a disproportionate financial burden on the poorer sections of society. The culmination of the anti-Poll Tax movement was a massive protest in London, organized by the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation, drawing demonstrators from across the country. While the march on March 31, 1990, began peacefully, it escalated into violent clashes between the police and protesters in and around Trafalgar Square. The day-long disturbance, widely covered by media, marked one of the largest riots seen in the British capital in the 20th century and signaled the depth of public anger against the tax. The significance of the Poll Tax Riots in the annals of British protest history lies in their immediate and profound impact. The severity of the unrest, combined with the broader campaign of non-payment by millions of citizens, eroded political support for both the Poll Tax and Thatcher's leadership. Within months of the riots, Margaret Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister, and her successor, John Major, swiftly moved to abolish the Poll Tax, replacing it with the more equitable Council Tax. Hence, the Poll Tax Riots serve as compelling evidence of how concerted, widespread public opposition can compel governmental reevaluation and reversal of controversial policies, underlining the critical role of civil action in a functioning democracy."},{"prompt":"why are protests successful in the uk","completion":"Protests in the UK can be successful for several reasons, grounded in the country's political, legal, and cultural frameworks. Here are some key factors contributing to the efficacy of protests in the UK: 1. **Strong Democratic Traditions**: The UK has a long history of democratic governance and public participation in political processes. This tradition supports the idea that people have a right to protest and that the government should be responsive to the concerns of its citizens. Such an environment makes it more likely for protests to gain attention and lead to meaningful discussions and changes. 2. **Rule of Law and Freedom of Expression**: Protesters in the UK are protected by laws that allow for freedom of expression and assembly. While there are regulations that protests must adhere to, these freedoms are a fundamental part of the UK's legal system. This protection enables individuals and groups to organize and participate in protests with the expectation that their rights will be respected, contributing to the potential success of their actions. 3. **Media Coverage**: The UK has a free and active press that can provide extensive coverage of protests, raising awareness of the issues at hand both nationally and internationally. Media attention can increase public sympathy for the cause, put pressure on policymakers, and attract more participants to the movement. 4. **Public Support and Mobilization**: Successful protests often resonate with a significant portion of the population, garnering widespread support. In the digital age, social media platforms have become powerful tools for organizing, mobilizing, and informing supporters quickly and effectively. A protest that captures the public's imagination and gains broad support is more likely to succeed. 5. **Constructive Engagement with Authorities**: In many cases, protest organizers in the UK engage constructively with local authorities and police to ensure that demonstrations are peaceful and well-coordinated. This engagement can help prevent conflict during protests and ensures that the protest's message is not overshadowed by incidents of violence or disorder. 6. **Historical Precedent and Cultural Acceptance**: The UK has a history of significant social and political changes being catalyzed by protests, from the Suffragettes' fight for women's voting rights to more recent protests against austerity measures. This historical context means that both the public and policymakers are aware that protests can be a legitimate and effective means of enacting change. 7. **Political Sensitivities**: UK politicians are often highly sensitive to public opinion, as their political survival depends on it. This makes them more likely to respond to large-scale demonstrations, especially when those protests gain significant media attention or highlight issues that resonate with a broad section of the electorate. While these factors contribute to the potential success of protests in the UK, it's important to note that not all protests achieve their immediate goals. Success can also depend on the specific demands of the protesters, the political climate, the strategies employed by movement leaders, and how authorities and the wider public respond to the protest actions."},{"prompt":"An error occurred while resolving packages: One or more packages could not be added to the local file system: com.unity.ai.navigation: undefined == true A re-import of the project may be required to fix the issue or a manual modification of D:/ProjectUnity/Unity-ZXing-BarQrCodeHandling-main/Packages/manifest.json file.","completion":"The error message you're encountering is related to the Unity package management system, specifically with the \`com.unity.ai.navigation\` package.

We are looking at this from potential cognitive architecture design (including perspective solutions search within potential space of models) perspective.","completion":"Your inquiry touches on numerous fundamental aspects of cognitive architecture in artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science. Cognitive architecture refers to a theory or model that outlines the structure and functioning of the cognitive processes in the human mind or an AI system. It aims at understanding how components of intelligence, such as reasoning, memory, planning, and personality, interact to produce behaviors, thoughts, and learning processes. Let's delve into the components you've mentioned and their relevance to computational models for cognitive processes. # Components of Intelligence and Cognitive Processes 1. **Reasoning, Memory, and Planning**: These are core components that any cognitive architecture needs to address. Reasoning allows for problem-solving and decision-making, memory for storing and retrieving information, and planning for setting and achieving goals. 2. **Persistent Personality (Goals/Ideals/Behaviour)**: Incorporating persistent personality into AI involves developing systems that can have consistent behavior patterns, values, and goals, simulating a human-like personality. 3. **Cognitive Processes**: - **Rehash, Recall, Recollection**: These processes relate to memory and involve retrieving past experiences or information. - **Inferential and Counterfactual Reasoning**: Inferential reasoning is about drawing conclusions from available information, while counterfactual reasoning involves considering alternative realities and outcomes. - **Formal Logic**: The application of formal logic is essential for structured problem-solving and reasoning. - **World Modelling**: This involves creating internal representations of the external world, crucial for understanding and interaction. - **Multimodal Fusion through Shared Common Representation**: Integrating information from different sensory modalities into a coherent representation is vital for a comprehensive understanding of the environment. - **Adversarial Agency**: Designing systems that can understand and react to adversarial intentions can be crucial in certain contexts, like security. - **Conversation/Social Navigation**: This includes understanding and participating in social interactions, recognizing social roles, and displaying appropriate social behaviors. - **Empathy**: Modeling empathy involves simulating other minds to understand and share their feelings, crucial for social interactions. - **Intuition/Heuristics**: Capturing the essence of intuitive decision-making and the use of heuristics can make AI systems more human-like. - **Embodied Agency**: Refers to the idea that cognition is influenced by the body's interactions with the world, emphasizing the importance of physical experiences in cognitive processes. - **Consciousness and Metacognition**: Incorporating elements of consciousness and the ability to think about one’s own thinking processes are advanced goals of cognitive architecture, aiming at self-awareness and adaptive learning. # Designing Cognitive Architectures In designing cognitive architectures that incorporate these elements, researchers draw from various disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and artificial intelligence. The goal is to create models that not only simulate human cognitive processes but also offer insights into the workings of the mind and potential improvements in AI. **Solution Search within Potential Space of Models** involves exploring different approaches such as symbolic (rule-based systems), connectionist (neural networks), and hybrid models that combine aspects of both. Each approach has its strengths and can be more suitable for different aspects of cognition. For example, connectionist models excel at pattern recognition and perception-related tasks, while symbolic models are better suited for reasoning and problem-solving involving structured knowledge. Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant progress in perceptual tasks and some aspects of reasoning and memory. However, challenges remain in integrating these components into a unified system that exhibits broad aspects of human intelligence, including emotional and social intelligence. The development of comprehensive cognitive architectures requires interdisciplinary research and the exploration of novel computational paradigms. Ultimately, the vision behind cognitive architecture is not just to replicate human cognition but also to understand it better and enhance AI systems' capabilities, enabling them to assist, augment, and work alongside humans effectively."},{"prompt":"What are limitations, fail modes and weaknesses of transformers architecture (and attention mechanism). Link them to reason why pure language models cannot be used as cognitive architecture on theirs own. Don't deny the potential to use them as a component of such design, however.","completion":"Transformers and their underlying attention mechanisms have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), driving significant advancements in machine learning models' ability to understand and generate human-like text. However, while transformers exhibit remarkable linguistic capabilities, their architecture inherently presents several limitations and weaknesses, especially when considered for applications beyond pure language tasks, such as forming the sole basis of a cognitive architecture. # Limitations and Weaknesses of Transformers 1. **Lack of World Knowledge and Understanding**: Transformers, by their design, learn patterns from the data they are trained on. While they can generate plausible-sounding text, they do not possess an understanding of the world or the factual correctness of their outputs. This lack of comprehension limits their ability to reason about real-world entities and events beyond correlating patterns found in their training data. 2. **Difficulty with Reasoning and Logical Inference**: Despite recent models showing some capabilities in solving reasoning tasks, transformers fundamentally struggle with tasks requiring complex logical inference or multistep reasoning. Their architecture does not inherently model causality or logical flows in a way that a human or a more sophisticated cognitive architecture might. 3. **Data and Energy Intensiveness**: The training process for large transformer models is data and energy-intensive, requiring vast datasets and significant computational resources. This not only makes them less accessible but also raises ethical and environmental concerns. 4. **Bias and Fairness**: Transformers can inherit and even amplify biases present in their training data. Without proper oversight, this can lead to biased, unfair, or harmful outputs, making them unsuitable for applications that require unbiased reasoning or ethical considerations. 5. **Lack of Generalization Outside Training Data**: While transformers are powerful at learning patterns within their training corpus, they can struggle to generalize to tasks, domains, or languages not well-represented in the training data. This limits their flexibility and adaptability, essential features of cognitive architectures. 6. **Lack of Intuitive Understanding and Common Sense**: AI models based on transformers often lack an intuitive understanding of basic concepts and common sense that humans use for everyday reasoning and decision-making. This gap can lead to nonsensical or glaringly wrong answers to simple questions, undermining their reliability. # Why Transformers Alone Cannot Form Cognitive Architectures Given these limitations, transformers cannot be used as standalone solutions for cognitive architectures, primarily because cognitive architectures aim to replicate or simulate human cognitive processes, which involve understanding, reasoning, learning from minimal data, generalizing across contexts, and incorporating ethical and social norms. The transformers' weaknesses in reasoning, logical inference, and understanding, along with their inability to inherently model the physical world or ethical considerations, highlight the critical gaps. However, this is not to say that transformers and attention mechanisms do not have a place within a broader cognitive architecture. They can serve as potent components, especially for processing and generating natural language, leveraging their unparalleled ability to understand and produce human-like text. When integrated with other models and systems designed to address their limitations—such as hybrid models incorporating symbolic reasoning, causality models, or systems designed for specific ethical or logical reasoning tasks—transformers can contribute to a more comprehensive and capable cognitive architecture. Such an integrated approach might overcome individual limitations, pooling the strengths of diverse models and approaches to simulate human-like cognition more accurately and effectively."},{"prompt":"What steps can be used to identify potential components and system design for cognitive architecture? Maybe something in line with neuroevolutionary [architecture] search or simulation of digital agents in virtual environment (maybe with game like process, perhaps including physics-based puzzles, but maybe cooperation and concurrency setups too)?","completion":"Designing a cognitive architecture requires a multidisciplinary approach, melding insights from psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and artificial intelligence. The goal is to create a system that not only mimics human cognitive processes but can also adapt and learn from its environment, ideally improving over time. Given the complexity of human cognition, identifying potential components and their optimal configuration is a significant challenge. Here are steps and strategies that can help in designing such a system, with an emphasis on neuroevolutionary architecture search and simulation in virtual environments: # 1. Define the Cognitive Capabilities to be Modeled - **Scope Identification**: Before diving into components and designs, it's crucial to clearly define which aspects of cognition the architecture should model. This could range from basic sensory processing and motor control to more complex functions like language understanding, social interaction, and logical reasoning. # 2. Explore and Mimic Biological Inspirations - **Neurobiological Insights**: Delve into neuroscientific research to understand how the human brain performs various cognitive tasks. This step can guide the selection or design of components that mimic these biological processes. - **Incorporate Psychological Theories**: Psychological models of cognition, memory, perception, and decision-making can offer frameworks for structuring components and their interactions. # 3. Use of Computational Techniques - **Neuroevolutionary Algorithms**: Utilize evolutionary algorithms to explore various network architectures automatically. This method can help identify effective structures for problem-solving, learning, and adaptation without predefining the architectures. - **Hybrid Modeling Approaches**: Consider combining different computational models (e.g., symbolic and connectionist approaches) to capture a broader range of cognitive processes. # 4. Simulation in Virtual Environments - **Digital Agent Simulation**: Deploy agents in virtual environments that simulate real-world physics, social interactions, and other relevant dynamics. This can help identify necessary cognitive components based on the challenges encountered by agents. - **Task-Specific Challenges**: Incorporate a variety of tasks, including physics-based puzzles for spatial and causal reasoning, cooperative tasks for testing social cognition and communication, and competitive scenarios to stimulate strategic thinking and learning. - **Adaptive Difficulty**: Design the environment to adapt its difficulty based on the agent's performance, encouraging continuous learning and adaptation. # 5. Evolutionary Pressure and Selection - **Survival and Reproduction**: Implement survival and reproduction as evolutionary pressures to foster the development of successful strategies and cognitive capabilities. Selection mechanisms can favor agents that demonstrate superior problem-solving, learning efficiency, and adaptability. - **Mutation and Recombination**: Allow for mutation and recombination of architecture components to explore a vast space of potential solutions and encourage the emergence of innovative strategies. # 6. Iterative Testing and Refinement - **Continuous Evaluation**: Regularly assess the performance of agents across different tasks and environments, using quantitative metrics to gauge progress. - **Refinement and Optimization**: Based on performance data, iteratively refine component designs and system configurations to enhance capabilities and address weaknesses. # 7. Scalability and Generalization - **Scaling Challenges**: Gradually increase the complexity of tasks and environments to test the architecture's scalability and ability to generalize across contexts. - **Cross-Domain Learning**: Encourage learning strategies that can be applied across different tasks and domains, simulating the human ability to transfer knowledge and skills. # 8. Ethical and Societal Considerations - **Consider Implications**: Throughout the design process, consider the ethical and societal implications of cognitive architectures, especially issues related to autonomy, privacy, and the potential impacts on employment and society. By following these steps, researchers can systematically explore the vast design space of cognitive architectures, capitalizing on evolutionary methods and simulations to iteratively refine and improve their models. This approach holds the promise of advancing our understanding of cognition and creating more sophisticated, versatile AI systems."},{"prompt":"To better define our scope. What are core aspects of cognition/intelligence? What can be considered auxiliary/secondary? From both best theories so far and out of the box perspectives.","completion":"Understanding cognition and intelligence requires delineating between core aspects that are fundamental to all cognitive systems and auxiliary or secondary aspects that, while important, may not be universally required or may serve more specialized functions. This distinction helps in focusing the design of cognitive architectures. The division between core and auxiliary elements can vary based on theoretical perspectives and the specific goals of the cognitive architecture in question. Here's an overview based on contemporary theories and some more speculative or \\"out of the box\\" views. # Core Aspects of Cognition/Intelligence 1. **Perception and Sensory Processing**: The ability to interpret sensory information from the environment is foundational. This includes visual perception, auditory processing, and other sensory modalities. 2. **Memory**: Critical for almost all cognitive processes, memory can be divided into working memory (short-term) and long-term memory, encompassing declarative (explicit) and procedural (implicit) memory. 3. **Learning**: The ability to acquire new information, skills, or behaviors and improve over time is central to intelligence. Learning mechanisms can include reinforcement learning, supervised and unsupervised learning, and observational learning. 4. **Reasoning and Problem Solving**: The capacity to manipulate information and apply logic to deduce new information, solve problems, and make decisions is fundamental. 5. **Language and Communication**: While not all intelligent systems require human-like language, the ability to communicate effectively is crucial for social species, including humans, particularly for sharing information and coordinating actions. 6. **Attention and Consciousness**: Attention mechanisms allow cognitive systems to focus on relevant information and ignore distractions. Consciousness, though more difficult to define, relates to the self-awareness and meta-cognitive abilities of an individual. # Auxiliary/Secondary Aspects of Cognition/Intelligence 1. **Emotional Processing**: Emotions play a significant role in human cognition, influencing decision-making, memory, and social interactions. While critical for humans, emotional processing might be considered auxiliary for some cognitive architectures, especially those not designed to mimic human-like interactions. 2. **Social Cognition**: The ability to understand, predict, and react to the behavior of others is essential for navigating social environments. This includes theory of mind (understanding that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from one's own), empathy, and moral reasoning. 3. **Creativity and Innovation**: The ability to generate novel ideas, solutions, or artistic expressions. While highly valuable, especially in human contexts, it may not be considered a core aspect for all types of cognitive systems. 4. **Metacognition**: The ability to reflect on and understand one's own cognitive processes. Metacognition is crucial for efficient learning and decision-making but may be more advanced or secondary depending on the intelligence level targeted. # Out of the Box Perspectives - **Embodied Cognition**: The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world suggests that cognition cannot be wholly separated from physical experience. This perspective might argue that sensory-motor integration is a core cognitive aspect. - **Distributed Cognition**: Posits that cognitive processes can extend beyond the individual to include tools, social interactions, and environments. From this perspective, an individual's ability to engage with and utilize external cognitive resources could be seen as a crucial aspect of intelligence. # Conclusion The distinction between core and auxiliary cognitive functions is partly theoretical and partly pragmatic, depending on the goals of the cognitive architecture being developed. For AI and cognitive systems aiming to closely replicate human cognition, emotional processing and social cognition might be elevated to core status. In contrast, systems designed for specific, non-social tasks might focus more on aspects like perception, memory, and problem-solving, treating social capabilities as auxiliary. Designers of cognitive architectures must critically assess the requirements of their intended application to prioritize the development of different cognitive components accordingly."},{"prompt":"Привет!

В моем предыдущем ответе я упустил этот момент. Callback-запросы не несут в себе объект \`message\`, подобный тем, что поступают при отправке сообщений напрямую от пользователя. Вместо этого, у них есть собственная структура. Когда вы вызываете \`generate_bio\` из \`process_refill\`, вы должны обеспечить правильные аргументы. Однако, \`generate_bio\` ожидает объект \`message\`, который используется для извлечения \`user_id\` через \`message.from_user.id\`, а \`callback_query.message\` относится к сообщению бота, а не к сообщению пользователя. Чтобы решить эту проблему, вы можете модифицировать \`generate_bio\`, чтобы она могла также принимать и обрабатывать \`user_id\` напрямую, а не извлекать его из \`message\`. Вам придется внести некоторые изменения в саму функцию: \`\`\`python async def generate_bio_from_user_id(user_id: int): async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: cursor = await db.execute('SELECT last_question_idx FROM users WHERE id = ?', (user_id,)) result = await cursor.fetchone() if result and result[0] > 0: await set_next_question(user_id, result[0]) else: await set_next_question(user_id, 0) @dp.callback_query_handler(lambda c: c.data == 'confirm_refill', state=Form.personal_account) async def process_refill(callback_query: types.CallbackQuery): user_id = callback_query.from_user.id async with aiosqlite.connect('memory_page.db') as db: # Удаление ответов пользователя await db.execute('DELETE FROM answers WHERE user_id=?', (user_id,)) await db.commit() # Сброс индекса последнего вопроса на 0, чтобы начать заново await db.execute('UPDATE users SET last_question_idx = 0 WHERE id = ?', (user_id,)) await db.commit() await bot.answer_callback_query(callback_query.id) # Используйте новую функцию здесь await generate_bio_from_user_id(user_id) \`\`\` Создав новую функцию \`generate_bio_from_user_id\`, вы сможете использовать её для запуска процесса создания биографии с идентификатором пользователя, не опираясь на объект \`message\`. В этом контексте \`user_id\` извлекается непосредственно из \`callback_query\`.

It indicates missing time in the geological record. Considering an unconformity below layer D, the sequence from oldest to youngest, taking into account the unconformity, is: F, E, G, H, C, D, I, A, B The unconformity suggests that D, I, A, and B are significantly younger than C and that layers older than C but younger than F have been eroded away or not deposited. 2) Since Basalt C is approximately 700 million years old and Granite F is approximately 2,100 million years old, Feature H being part of the rock sequence above F but below C, would be older than 700 million years but younger than 2,100 million years. Its exact age is undetermined without more information, but it falls within this range. 3) The age of Feature A is younger than Feature C (700 million years old) due to the principles of superposition and because it is closer to the surface than C. However, without further absolute dating, we can't specify its exact age, only that it's one of the youngest layers in the sequence provided, being younger than the unconformity and the layers below it. 4) The sequence of layers I-G-A represents a series of depositional environments changing over time. Assuming normal depositional circumstances, Shale (G) typically forms in quiet water conditions, such as deep marine environments; Sandstone (I) often forms from sand deposited in environments such as beaches or river channels, indicating a possibly more energetically deposited environment than the shale; Limestone (A) generally precipitates from the ocean or lake water as organisms’ shells accumulate, indicating clear, warm, shallow, marine conditions. This sequence from I to A suggests a transition from a possibly fluvial or nearshore environment to a deeper marine environment and back to shallow, warm marine conditions, indicating transgressive (sea level rising) then regressive (sea level falling) sequences over time. 5) Oxygen isotope ratios, such as the (^{18}O : ^{16}O) ratio, are used as proxies for past temperatures, with higher ratios indicating colder temperatures (as (^{18}O) is heavier and hence more likely to fall out in snow during colder periods). The increase in the (^{18}O) ratio from 1980 ppm in Limestone A to 2020 ppm in Limestone B suggests a cooling trend globally through the time represented by these formations, implying that B was deposited during a cooler period relative to A. 6) If Basalt C is 700 million years old and the half-life of uranium-235 to lead-207 is 704 million years, this means that about one half-life has occurred. Therefore, roughly one-half of the original amount of uranium-235 would remain, with the other half having decayed to lead-207. 7) With 85 uranium-235 atoms remaining and 255 lead-207 atoms present, for every uranium-235 atom, there are three lead atoms (255 / 85 = 3). This indicates that two half-lives have occurred because, after one half-life, half of the uranium-235 atoms would decay (leaving us with a 1:1 ratio of uranium-235 to lead-207), and after the second half-life, another half of the remaining uranium-235 would decay, leaving a 1:3 ratio of uranium-235 to lead-207."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short 1970s Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the opening with the villains and the random characters that are in FROM THE FIRST PARAGRAPH SENTENCE (With funny dialogue) moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt:(but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, The Mystery Machine is always parked in the most oddest places, beginning to end.

Camera zooms into the castle where we see Time Slime, a gooey, clock-faced monster hovering over a gigantic, ancient clock. Standing beside him is a character dressed in a medieval knight's armor but obviously too short for it, named Sir Ticks-a-lot.] Time Slime: [Looking menacingly at his wrist, where a small sundial is strapped] \\"It's about time the world gets a new master of hours, minutes, and seconds! And with my partner-in-crime, Sir Ticks-a-lot, we shall rule every tick and every tock!\\" Sir Ticks-a-lot: [Struggling to lift his sword, which drags on the floor with a loud clank] \\"Yes, my gooey overlord, but first, could you help me adjust this helmet? I can barely see through this visor.\\" [Cut to The Mystery Machine, chaotically parked halfway up a tree near the castle. Inside, the gang is listening to a local radio broadcast about the Time Slime's recent chaos.] Fred: \\"So, a gelatinous clock and his knight in shining armor too short for his britches are trying to take over time itself?

Velma: \\"Let's split up, gang. Bernie, you do...whatever it is you do best. Sleep on the job, I presume?\\" [The gang encounters various absurd traps and gadgets meant to alter time, like a grandfather clock that shoots laser beams and a calendar that traps you in your worst Mondays.] Fred: \\"This clock shoots lasers? Because, clearly, that's what every antique needs.\\" As they confront Time Slime and Sir Ticks-a-lot, the villains explain their plan to make every moment a chaotic jumble. Time Slime: \\"With every strike of noon, the world will fall into a loop of chaos!\\" Velma, using her intelligence, devises a plan involving Bernie.

Building upon the economic miracle that followed the devastation of World War II, Japan's ascent to a global superpower was cemented by a series of geopolitical shifts and strategic acquisitions that would redefine the balance of power in the Eastern Hemisphere. The reintegration of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese sphere of influence signified the initial step towards Japan's regional dominance. The demise of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) and Mao Zedong, leading to the reunification of Nationalist China with the mainland, left these territories in a state of uncertainty. It was within this context that Japan, drawing upon its historical claims and fostering an environment of reconciliation and growth, restored the province of Formosa. This move not only bolstered Japan's strategic position in the Pacific but also leveraged the advanced military and technological assets left behind by both American and Soviet forces. Indeed, the integration of the Republic of China Armed Forces remnants into the Japan Self-Defense Forces marked a seamless transition, enhancing Japan's military capabilities while reinforcing its stance on self-defense. The return of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands from the Soviet Union, based on economic concessions and a subtle diplomatic understanding, further expanded Japan's territorial holdings. The re-establishment of the province of Karafuto underscored Japan's commitment to reclaiming its historical boundaries, contributing significantly to its natural resources and strategic depth. Perhaps the most transformative event came with the fall of the Korean Peninsula's post-WWII regimes. The spread of pro-democracy movements, initially kindling in the Republic of Korea, eventually ignited similar uprisings in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The joint decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to return control of the peninsula to Japan, amidst the chaos, mirrored the earlier situations in Taiwan and Okinawa. Restoring the province of Chōsen, Japan embarked on an ambitious integration process. The assimilation of the Korean Peninsula’s military assets into the Japan Self-Defense Forces and the merging of economic and technological strengths significantly propelled Japan's standing on the global stage. The absorption of the DPRK's and ROK's elite forces and intelligence apparatus into Japan's security and intelligence agencies marked a significant enhancement in Japan’s capacity for both national defense and international intelligence operations. Furthermore, the acquisition of nuclear technology from the defunct DPRK's arsenal added a new dimension to Japan's strategic deterrence capabilities. With the integration of Taiwan, the Pengu Islands, Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, and the Korean Peninsula, Japan had not only substantially increased its territorial expanse but had also diversified its economic and military strengths. The country's industrious approach to incorporating the advanced technological and industrial capabilities of these regions augmented its already booming economy, reinforcing its position as a leading economic powerhouse. The twenty-first century dawned with Japan standing at the zenith of its power, a beacon of technology, culture, and military might. Its ascendance to a superpower was not just a testament to its resilience and strategic acumen but also a profound reshaping of geopolitical dynamics in the East. Japan's story of resurgence and expansion unfolded as a pivotal chapter in the annals of modern history, signifying the dawn of a new era where the sun, indeed, never set on the Japanese empire."},{"prompt":"Create an OP FM24 tactic that uses a good formation that exploits and creats a lot of space.

It's worth noting that the exact specifications can vary from one region to another, and some terms might be used interchangeably based on personal or regional preferences.

This paradigm shift was epitomized by the resurgence of Japan as a dominant political, economic, military, and cultural superpower. The pivotal moment came with the reunification of Nationalist China with the Chinese mainland, an event that precipitated the return of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands to Japanese governance. This chapter seeks to explore the multifaceted repercussions of Japan's territorial expansions and the nation's strategic maneuvering on the global stage. Upon reassuming control over the territories of Formosa (Taiwan) and the Pengu Islands, Japan embarked on a journey of integration that would fortify its position as an unrivaled power. The remnants of the Republic of China Armed Forces left stranded in these territories were seamlessly absorbed into Japan's Self-Defence Forces (JSDF), marking a significant bolstering of Japan's military capability. However, it was not merely the augmentation of military muscle that Japan secured through these acquisitions; the advanced technologies, both industrial and espionage-related, left behind by the Americans and Soviets were assimilated into the Japanese technological sphere, catapulting Japan to the forefront of global innovation. The reclamation of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands from Soviet control further exemplified Japan's expanding geopolitical influence. The restoration of the Japanese province of Karafuto on these territories not only symbolized a reversal of post-World War II territorial adjustments but also demonstrated a pragmatic approach by the Soviets to engage with Japan amidst their economic tribulations. This transfer, serving as an implied non-aggression accord, underscored the shifting allegiances and strategic reorientations characteristic of the era's fluid international relations. The most striking illustration of Japan's ascendancy, however, was the reunification of the entire Korean peninsula under Japanese administration. The cascade of pro-democracy protests that swept across the Republic of Korea and subsequently the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea resulted in the toppling of both regimes. In a move mirroring the earlier return of Taiwan and Okinawa, the major powers conceded to the return of the peninsula to Japanese sovereignty. The restoration of the province of Chōsen on the Korean peninsula not only expanded Japan's territorial dominion but also brought under its control the military and technological prowess of the Korean states. Through the absorption of the Republic of Korea's Armed Forces and the clandestine assets of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Japan significantly enhanced its intelligence and special operations capabilities. Moreover, the economic and industrial strengths of both Koreas were integrated into the Japanese economy, cementing Japan’s status as an economic juggernaut. The acquisition of tools for nuclear armament from the dissolved Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Nationalist China provided Japan with a strategic deterrent capability, catapulting it into the echelon of global military powers. The consolidation and integration of these territories and assets marked a new epoch in Japan's history. As the nation embraced its role as a superpower, it wielded its economic, military, and cultural influence to shape a new world order. The strategic foresight, diplomatic acumen, and technological innovation that characterized Japan's ascendancy not only ensured its place at the pinnacle of global affairs but also heralded a new era of prosperity, stability, and influence for the East Asian region. The dawn of the 21st century found Japan at the helm of a transformed geopolitical landscape, a testament to the enduring legacy of its strategic expansions and the visionary policies that facilitated its rise to supremacy."},{"prompt":"HTML conversions sometimes display errors due to content that did not convert correctly from the source.

One way to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user is through personas, aspects of the user’s character that provide insights into their personality, motivations, and behaviors. Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead to conversational models that create a deeper connection with the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed dataset. We propose a Generator-Critic architecture framework to expand the initial dataset, while improving the quality of its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to output conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations. These experts select the best generated conversations, which we then use to improve the Generator. We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat1 1 Dataset available at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations seeded from Persona-Chat Zhang et al. (2018). We evaluate the quality of Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on different dimensions through extensive experiments, and observe that the losing rate of Synthetic-Persona-Chat against Persona-Chat during Turing test decreases from 17.2% to 8.8% over three iterations. 1 Introduction Every person is a story. Systems that interact with people must understand their underlying stories to effectively engage with them. Unfortunately, many existing datasets used for training conversational agents do not sufficiently model their users. Personas - abstract user representations that express the “story” of a person based on their background and preferences - have been widely used for human-centered design in a variety of domains, including marketing, system design, and healthcare Pruitt and Grudin (2003b). Prior persona-based conversational datasets, like Persona-Chat (PC) Zhang et al. (2018), suffer from several limitations, such as small size, static dialogues that cannot easily be updated with new topics, irrelevant utterances, and contradictory persona attributes Wu et al. (2019). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for generating large, dynamic, persona-based conversational datasets that capture the breadth and depth of human experience. Personas Pruitt and Grudin (2003a); Cooper and Saffo (1999) have been widely used in a variety of domains and applications, including creating narratives for patients and sharing educational messages in healthcare Massey et al. (2021), targeting users in marketing van Pinxteren et al. (2020); Fuglerud et al. (2020), and communicating with workers in management Claus (2019). Conversational agents use personas to generate more interesting and engaging conversations with their users Zhou et al. (2019); Shum et al. (2019). Creating persona-based datasets is difficult: the process is labor-intensive, the outputs must be updated to reflect current events and new concepts, and there are often quality concerns. Existing persona-based datasets have resulted from labor-intensive data collection processes Zhang et al. (2018); Zhong et al. (2020) involving humans to create or validate personas, create fictional persona-based conversations, and ensure the conversations are coherent. Moreover, even after these datasets are created, it is difficult to update them with the latest topics Lee et al. (2022), such as current events, new concepts, products, or social trends Lazaridou et al. (2021). Finally, existing persona-based datasets do not guarantee faithfulness, a criterion we introduce to describe the alignment between participants’ utterances and their personas. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for generating large, customized persona-based conversational datasets that uses unsupervised LLMs to reduce human labor, introduces methods to generate, expand, and update personas automatically, and enforces a set of quality criteria including faithfulness to ensure dialogues are human-like. Our persona-based conversational dataset generation framework consists of a three-level pipeline: 1. User Generation 2. User Pairing 3. Conversation Generation The user generation step takes a set of seed personas, and augments it to create plausible user profiles. The user pairing step matches users to participate in conversations. The conversation generation produces plausible conversations between the selected user pairs. The conversation generation component uses a method similar to self-feedback Madaan et al. (2023) to iteratively improve the quality of generated samples. We used the proposed framework to create Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC), a conversational dataset with 5⁢k user personas, and 20⁢k faithful dialogues. The framework we defined to create this dataset can be reused to define specialized personas, such as user music profiles, etc. to create application-specific datasets. Our contributions are: • We propose an unsupervised approach to generate, and extend specialized personas using LLMs. • We introduce and evaluate a framework based on LLMs to evolve a dataset while imposing different objectives on it. • We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat, a high-quality, faithful, persona-based conversational dataset useful for several conversational tasks, such as training persona inference models. 2 Definitions We define the faithful persona-based dialogue generation task. We begin by defining the persona-based dialogue generation task. We then formally define the faithfulness criteria as a desired quality for the generated dialogues. Throughout this section, we use π to refer to persona attributes (individual sentences which, together, form the user persona), U to refer to user profiles, and D to refer to conversations (dialogues). Persona Attributes We define a user persona attribute as a sentence describing this user. \\"I like ice cream\\", \\"I have two brothers\\" and \\"My native language is Tamazight\\" are all examples of persona attributes. Let Ω be the universal set of persona attributes. Ω contains all natural language descriptions of all tangible features of any person, which is unbounded. Persona Categories To help organize the vast space of personas, we adopt the approach of Lee et al. (2022) who introduced persona categories. Persona categories are groups of persona attributes that describe the same semantic feature of the user. In our work, we associate each persona category with a corresponding query that can be answered with all persona attributes in that category. For example, job and family situation are persona categories, and corresponding queries might be “What is your occupation?”, and “Do you have a family?”. Persona Attribute Structure Persona attributes can overlap. For instance, the attribute \\"I introduced my kids to scuba diving at a young age\\" overlaps with the attribute \\"My eldest son goes to elementary school\\", since both include the \\"parenthood\\" feature of the user. Moreover, some persona attributes form a hierarchy, and some persona attributes are specific cases of other attributes. User Profile We define a user profile as a set of persona attributes that can be used to describe a user. For a realistic user, the persona attributes describing a user profile should not contradict each other, and be consistent. An arbitrary persona attribute set U⊂Ω is a consistent set of persona attribute if, and only if: ∀π1∈U,∄⁢Π2⊂U:(Π2≠∅)∧(Π2→¬⁢π1) Persona-based Conversation A persona-based conversation D contains utterances such that at least one persona attribute from each user profile can be inferred from it. For example, the persona attribute \\"I am a parent\\" can be inferred from the utterance \\"I just dropped off my son at school\\". A persona-based conversation model is a generative model that takes a pair of user profiles (U1, U2) as input, and returns a persona-based dialogue D between these two users. Faithfulness One crucial quality for a persona-based conversation is that it should align with the user profile. Inspired by Daheim et al. (2023) which introduces dialogue system faithfulness to the knowledge contained in relevant documents, we specify the criterion of faithfulness to characterize the alignment between the utterances of a user in a persona-based conversation and their profile. The faithfulness criterion enforces the constraint that the utterances of a user should not decrease the likelihood of their persona. This criterion assumes the existence of both a prior probability of persona attributes, and an inference model for determining the probability of persona attributes conditioned on utterances. Let M be such an inference model, (U1, U2) a pair of user profiles, and D a persona-based conversation between them. To be a faithful conversation based on M, D should not contain any contradicting evidence to the persona attributes of the speakers: passing the conversation D as input to the inference model M should not reduce the inference probability of persona attributes in either of the user profiles U1 or U2. In other words, the probability of any persona attribute in the user profiles based on conversation D should not be less than the probability of that persona attribute without any assumptions. Formally, we call a conversation D faithful with respect to the user profiles U1 and U2, and inference model M if the following condition holds: ∀π∈U1∪U2:PM⁢(π|D)≥PM⁢(π). Where PM⁢(π|D) indicates the probability that M infers the persona π given conversation D. We show examples of faithful, and unfaithful conversations in Figure 1. Refer to caption Figure 1: Unfaithful Conversation (Left): Loving steak is negatively correlated with the persona attribute \\"I am a vegetarian\\". Faithful Conversation (Right): It introduces no information that contradicts or weakens the user’s profile. 3 Method In this section, we introduce our method to generate persona-based conversations. We create such conversations with minimum human input, starting from an initial dataset. Our process consists of three steps, as shown in Figure 2: user generation, user pairing, and conversation generation. The first component augments a set of seed persona attributes Π0 into an expanded set of persona attributes Πe, from which it creates user profiles. The second component pairs user profiles as interlocutors of a conversation. The third and final component uses an iterative process to generate high-quality conversations among user profile pairs. We detail each of these components below. Refer to caption Figure 2: Dataset Augmentation Pipeline 3.1 User Generation The User Generation component is split into two sub-components: 1. Persona Expansion 2. User Profile Construction We bootstrap seed persona attributes by using various prompts Brown et al. (2020b) to generate new persona attributes in the Persona Expansion step (Refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the prompts used). We then create new user profiles by iteratively selecting random user persona attributes from the expanded persona attributes. We employ a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model to ensure the consistency of the constructed user profiles. 3.1.1 Persona Expansion We propose an unsupervised method to augment a set of seed persona attributes Π0 into a super-set Πe. Unlike previous approaches Lee et al. (2022), our method is independent of human knowledge or intervention, making it capable of creating specialized personas in new domains. We proceed in two steps: query induction, and persona bootstrapping. In the query induction phase, we identify persona categories in Π0, along with associated queries. We then expand these queries into a set Q that also covers unobserved persona categories. The persona bootstrapping step leverages the category-based query set Q, and the initial persona attribute seed set Π0 to generate new persona attributes. Both of these steps are based on the bootstrapping technique Yarowsky (1995), and involve prompting an LLM. We provide a detailed description of these two steps in the following. Query Induction As described in Section 2, each persona attribute belongs to at least one persona category, and each category is associated with a corresponding query that can be answered with persona attributes in that category. The query induction process initially identifies the queries associated with persona categories in Π0. It then bootstraps queries by feeding them to a prompted LLM to create more queries that are associated with unobserved categories, ultimately creating a query set Q. Including queries associated with unobserved persona categories facilitates the creation of a more diverse set of personas, and increases the scale of augmentation. The query induction relies on the following assumption: Assumption Let ℳ be an LLM, and let Γ be the set of all queries associated with all persona categories. If two persona attributes π1 and π2 belong to the same persona category, then there exists a query qℳ∈Γ such that π1 and π2 are ℳ’s output to qℳ. The persona attributes \\"I am a doctor\\" and \\"I am a truck driver\\", for instance, both belong to the \\"job\\" category, leading to the query \\"What is your job?\\". We use an agglomerative clustering method to identify the persona categories in Π0. Let C be an arbitrary persona cluster in Π0. To generate a query for C, we select a random subset of persona attributes in C, and create a prompt using these samples. We employ this strategy to generate queries for all the clusters identified in Π0, and create a set of queries, which we refer to as Q0. Details on the clustering, query induction, together with examples of clusters, persona attributes, and induced queries are available in Appendix A.1. We come up with queries for new, unobserved persona categories by bootstrapping the queries in Q0: starting from Q=Q0, we iteratively sample a set of queries from Q, and create a prompt by concatenating them. We then prompt the LLM to generate a new query, and add it to the query set Q, as shown in Figure 3. We generated a total of |Q|=188 queries. This set of category-specific queries Q is later used to guide the LLM to generate new persona attributes from the specified category. Thus, higher values of |Q| result in greater diversity within the expanded persona attribute set. Refer to caption Figure 3: Query Induction Steps Persona Bootstrapping We use the persona attribute seed set Π0 and category-specific queries Q to generate new persona attributes through a bootstrapping process. We initialize Π to Π0. At every iteration, we randomly select a subset of persona attributes from Π, and create a set of prompts as follows: we first concatenate a set of persona attributes s. For every query q∈Q, we then combine the concatenated samples s, and the query q to create a category-specific persona prompt. This prompt guides the LLM to generate a persona attribute for that persona category. The set of prompts obtained from this process is {s⁢q|q∈Q}. We only add a new persona attribute to the set if its BERT embeddings Devlin et al. (2019) are not too close from existing ones, so as to prevent the addition of duplicates. Each of these prompts is then fed to the LLM to create a new persona attribute, which is subsequently added to the set of persona attributes Π for the next iteration. We continue this iterative process until we have generated a total of 5k persona attributes. Figure 4 illustrates the persona bootstrapping process. Table 6 in the appendix contains the prompt template used in this component. Refer to caption Figure 4: Query-based Persona Bootstrapping Process 3.1.2 User Profile Construction We build user profiles incrementally by sampling persona attributes from Πe, and adding the eligible ones. A persona attribute is eligible if it adheres to the criteria of consistency and non-redundancy. In other words, it should not contradict any attribute already in the user profile, and it should not be inferred by other persona attribute. We assess the consistency and redundancy of user profiles by leveraging an NLI model, and persona attribute clustering, respectively. The NLI model we employ is based on T5 Raffel et al. (2019), and has been trained on the TRUE dataset Honovich et al. (2022). We create a user profile U by iteratively selecting a random candidate persona attribute π′∈Πe. We use the NLI model to assess whether π′ contradicts any persona attribute in the profile. This is determined by the condition: ∀π∈U:(π′↛¬⁢π)∧(π↛¬⁢π′), where → is an inference. Additionally, we evaluate the similarity of π′ to the persona attributes in U to prevent the addition of redundant attributes. We add π′ to U if it meets the consistency and non-redundancy criteria. We repeat this process until the user profile contains 5 persona attributes. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the user profile construction. 3.2 User Pairing In this component, we identify potential pairs of users for conversations. As the conversations are persona-based, we hypothesize that they will be more engaging if the users’ personas exhibit more commonalities. We assign a similarity score to every pair of user profiles (U1,U2), indicating their semantic similarity. We leverage BERT to represent the user profiles. The similarity between U1 and U2 is defined as: |{(π1,π2)|π1∈U1,π2∈U2,∃c:π1,π2∈c}| Where c is a persona attributes cluster. The semantic similarity is quantified by the number of common persona categories in the user profiles. We pair U1 and U2 if their similarity exceeds a threshold of 2. 3.3 Conversation Generation Our Conversation Generation component is similar to a general-purpose dataset generation framework that generates data samples, and refines them based on a set of predefined criteria, which we refer to as policies Madaan et al. (2023). The flexibility in the choice of policies for data generation allows us to emphasize different objectives. Once the active policies are selected, this component generates new data samples using a few input samples. The input to our Conversation Generation framework consists of a set of paired user profiles, a few samples of user profiles along with a persona-based conversation between them, and conversation quality metrics as policies. We follow a Generator-Critic architecture, and iteratively create the dataset following the steps shown in Figure 5: Step 1 The Generator outputs candidate conversations between persona pairs using a few initial conversation samples. Step 2 The Critic evaluates the candidate conversations based on the predetermined policies, and selects the best candidate conversations. Step 3 The best candidate conversations are added to the dataset for the next iteration of generation. This iterative process of selecting the top candidates and adding them to the dataset gradually improves the performance of the Generator. Without any loss of generality, we implement both the Generator and the Critic based on LLMs. Specifically, the Generator prompts an LLM to create candidate conversations, while the Critic prompts an LLM to evaluate the quality of the generated conversations. We provide more details on the Generator, Critic, and the policies we used. Refer to caption Figure 5: The Generator-Critic Architecture for Conversation Generation The Generator outputs conversations for pairs of users (U1,U2) by prompting an LLM Brown et al. (2020b); Wei et al. (2023). At each iteration, it randomly selects 5 samples from an initial set of conversations, each containing a pair of user profiles and a dialogue among them. It feeds these samples to a template that instructs the LLM to generate a series of candidate conversations for the given user pair. The template, and a sample generated conversation are available in Table 6, and Table 8 in the appendix. The Critic selects the best generated conversations to fine-tune the Generator. A conversation is deemed high-quality if it complies with the policies of the Critic. Given the multifaceted nature of the conversation evaluations, we use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach. Each expert evaluates the conversation based on a specific policy. In this paper, we incorporate three types of experts, each with distinct criteria: general conversation quality, persona faithfulness, and toxicity. Collectively, these experts select the best generated conversations (the single best in our experiments). We describe each type of expert, and the collective decision-making process below. General Conversation Quality experts assess conversation quality using the Fine-grained Evaluation of Dialog (FED) metrics introduced in Mehri and Eskénazi (2020). These experts use verbalized forms of the policies from FED as prompts. For instance, the \\"conversation depth quality expert\\" transforms the \\"depth policy\\" from FED into a prompt like \\"Which conversation is a deeper conversation between user 1 and user 2?\\". Our system instructs the LLM to compare each pair of candidate conversations based on these policies, resulting in pairwise comparisons. The list of policies and their baseline performance are presented in Table 5 in Appendix A.2. The Faithfulness expert ensures the consistency of the generated conversations with the user profiles. It uses an LLM to identify instances of unfaithful conversations. The faithfulness prompt provides the LLM with explicit instructions, user profiles, and human-curated examples of unfaithful conversations. The Toxicity expert detects any conversation that exhibits harmful traits, including bias and hate. The Critic filters unfaithful and toxic conversations out. It then selects the best conversations using a majority vote among the General Conversation Quality experts. The selected instances are added to the dataset for the next iteration of the Generator. 4 Evaluation We evaluate different aspects of our dataset generation framework, and the resulting dataset - referred to as Synthetic-Persona-Chat - which is created using an instruction fine-tuned LLM with 24 billion parameters Chung et al. (2022). We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC) against the widely used Persona-Chat (PC) dataset across different dimensions. We begin by evaluating the quality of the personas we generate. We then evaluate SPC using both automatic metrics, and human assessment. We analyze other aspects of SPC, such as toxicity and diversity in appendices B.1 and B.1. 4.1 Evaluation of the Expanded Personas We evaluate our persona expansion module on two seed datasets: Wikipedia, and Persona-Chat. The Wikipedia personas are created by crawling the 1,000 most active contributors2 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits, and extracting user boxes from their pages. We expand both datasets using our framework, and evaluate the expanded persona attribute sets using automatic metrics. Table 1 compares the original persona sets to the expanded ones on a few dimensions. We observe that our persona expansion increases the number of persona attributes in SPC by 119%, while maintaining the original persona categories and expanding them by 71% compared to the persona attributes in PC. Moreover, the lengths of the new generated persona attributes are 107% longer in SPC, indicating that the new personas exhibit greater detail and specificity. We observe a similar trend when applying our persona expansion to the Wikipedia persona set, with a 108% increase in the number of persona attributes, a 140% increase in persona categories, and a 45% growth in persona attribute lengths. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in expanding and diversifying persona sets.

The numbers with * indicate the metric value of the newly generated persona attributes to contrast with the initial set. 4.2 Next Utterance Prediction A persona-based conversation reflects the speaker’s persona explicitly or implicitly. Therefore, we expect the inclusion of information about speaker personas to enhance the performance of next utterance prediction models in such conversations. In this experiment, we assess the impact of incorporating speaker personas as prior information on both ranking, and generative - Transformer based Vaswani et al. (2017) - next utterance prediction models. We create a subset of SPC containing conversations among user pairs included in PC for a fair comparison. Persona-Chat Synthetic-Persona-Chat Method Metric None Persona % Change None Persona % Change IR Baseline hit@1 18.69 36.86 +97 19.37 (19.92) 39.6 (26.23) +104 (+31) Transformer (Ranker) hit@1 14.24 19.21 +35 9.71 (64.24) 11.74 (68.82) +21 (+7) Transformer (Generator) hit@1 8.54 6.78 -20 6.89 (41.32) 6.66 (37.35) -3 (-9) Perplexity 122.5 173.3 +41 1032 (5.24) 1126 (5.73) +9 (+9) BLUE 0.120 0.094 -21 0.097 (0.289) 0.083 (0.251) -14 (-13) ROUGE 0.141 0.113 -24 0.123 (0.348) 0.107 (0.309) -13 (-11) Table 2: Results of the next utterance prediction experiment. Performance of the trained model on the test split of Persona-Chat is represented by the numbers in the table, while the numbers in parentheses indicate results for the test split of Synthetic-Persona-Chat. We observe (Table 2) that the performance of ranking models increases when personas are given to the models as input for both datasets. Specifically, the Transformer (Ranker) model, known for its ability to capture conversational complexity, exhibits higher performance in SPC when evaluated on the SPC test set compared to the PC test set. However, it demonstrates relatively weaker performance when trained on the PC. This implies that SPC contains more intricate and coherent conversations. The Transformer (Ranker) trained on SPC achieves a hit@1 of 64.24 on SPC test, 350% higher than PC (14.24). This suggests that the Transformer model can more accurately predict the next utterance in SPC, pointing to a greater coherency in conversations. The performance of the Information Retrieval (IR) Baseline model is slightly higher for SPC: it rises by 31% when conditioned on user personas, which is lower than 97% improvement in PC. A key contributing factor for the performance improvement of the retrieval-based model (IR Baseline) on PC given the personas, is the participants’ tendency to copy persona words in the conversations, whereas in SPC the personas are more implicitly reflected in the conversations. The implicit reflection of personas in SPC, makes the task more challenging for word based retrieval models, necessitating reasoning that goes beyond word level. However, when the model is trained on SPC and tested on PC, the improvement is as high as when the model is trained on PC, i.e. 104% compared to 97%. The performance of generative models is low for this task since these models are not trained with the ranking objective. However, the performance difference while the models are conditioned on personas is lower for the model trained on SPC, with a 20% drop for the model trained on PC against 3% drop in the model trained on SPC. The increase in perplexity is 9% in SPC compared to 41% in PC. The lower rate of perplexity increase and performance drop of the model given user personas as input highlights the higher alignment of conversations with personas in SPC. We also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results suggest a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC. We refer the reader to the Appendix B.1 for more details. 4.3 Human Evaluation We compare the quality of the conversations generated by our framework against those in Persona-Chat. We randomly select 200 conversations from PC, together with their corresponding user pairs, and use our method to generate conversations among the same users. We start by following Gehrmann et al. (2019) in running a human experiment to try and detect AI-generated content. We conduct a Turing test where we present pairs of conversations to humans, and ask them to identify the synthetically generated one. This test is carried out on the generated conversations at the end of each iteration of creating SPC. We repeat the test for conversations generated for new persona pairs, which we refer to as iteration 3*, i.e. we pair each of these conversations with a random conversation from PC. For a robust evaluation, every pair of conversations is annotated by 3 human evaluators, and the majority vote is used as the final annotation. Details of this test are available in Appendix B.2. The results of this experiment can be found in Table 3. We observe that the losing rate of SPC is reduced by 48% from SPC Iter 1 to SPC Iter 3, and dropped below the rate of 10%. Interestingly, 91% of the conversations in SPC, which are synthetically generated, are judged as human-like as the conversations generated by humans. Moreover, conversations generated for new personas (Iteration 3*) are deemed artificial in only 8.04% of cases, showing that SPC is more realistic than PC. We also evaluate the faithfulness of the generated conversations. For each conversation, we provide annotators with a faithfulness annotation task including the speakers’ persona attributes and distractor persona attribute options as shown in Figure 8. We evaluate faithfulness during 3 iterations of conversation generation for the selected 200 user pairs, and the annotators evaluate the generated conversations for each pair in every iteration. The results show that, while improving the Turing test results, faithfulness of conversations are consistently higher than 75% with at most 3% variation in between iterations, indicating high faithfulness in all iterations. Finally, we assess the impact of LLM size on the quality of the generated dataset within our framework. We create a variant of SPC using an LLM with 540 billion parameters (LLM2). Table 3 presents human evaluations comparing the smaller LLM in multiple iterations to a single-iteration approach with LLM2. The larger model exhibits a 5% advantage in the Turing test over the first iteration of dataset generation over the smaller model. After two iterations, however, the multi-iteration approach outperforms the first iteration of the bigger model, showing our framework’s capacity for cost-effective, high-quality conversation generation.

(2021), generation Kim et al. (2023); Dong et al. (2023), and evaluation Zhang et al. (2019); Liu et al. (2023). One of the earliest works in this area Anaby-Tavor et al. (2019) used LLMs to create a large text dataset from a small, labeled one. This idea was followed by Wang et al. (2021); Schick and Schütze (2021) which leveraged LLMs to create datasets without any human data. Kumar et al. (2020) evaluated the performance of different LLMs on the data augmentation task. Several conversational dataset generation methods focused on the structure of the conversational data Dai et al. (2022); Leszczynski et al. (2023); Abbasiantaeb et al. (2023). Mehri et al. (2022) illustrated how Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively generate synthetic training data for task-oriented dialogue models. Persona-based conversations have been a popular research topic in NLP Liu et al. (2022). One of the earliest works in this area is Persona-Chat, by Zhang et al. (2018), which proposed the Persona-Chat dataset and evaluation metrics that have become a benchmark for persona-based conversation generation Mazaré et al. (2018). Many subsequent works have used this dataset to train and evaluate their models, including DialoGPT Zhang et al. (2020), BlenderBot Shuster et al. (2022), and PersonaChatGen Lee et al. (2022). PersonaChatGen automated the process of creating persona based conversations of Persona-Chat using LLMs. A challenge in generating synthetic datasets is to ensure the quality of the conversation including data faithfulness, fidelity, diversity, and consistency Li et al. (2016); Lee et al. (2023); Veselovsky et al. (2023); Zhuo et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023a); Mündler et al. (2023). Several works have focused on creating and using high quality training datasets Welleck et al. (2019), and creating quality filtering components to their conversation dataset generation Lewkowycz et al. (2022). Evaluation of the resulting conversational datasets is also challenging Xu et al. (2021). Wang et al. (2023b) recently introduced the paradigm of interactive evaluation of conversations with LLMs. 6 Conclusion and Future Work We developed a novel framework for generating high-quality persona-based conversations using LLMs, resulting in the creation of Synthetic-Persona-Chat, comprising 20k conversations. We hope this dataset will support future endeavors in developing persona-aware conversational agents, including the generation of domain-specific multi-session conversations for specialized, task-oriented interactions. While we focused on a persona-based dataset generation task, our Generator-Critic approach can be generalized to other use cases, such as generating other specialized datasets, etc. Limitations In this paper, we define an iterative process over LLMs to generate a dataset. Our method requires computational resources, and access to an LLM. The quality of the dataset is bounded by the LLM, since the quality critics are also using the same LLM, and we leave the iterative improvement of our critics as future work. The main limitation of this data generation framework is the inability to generate realistic conversations that do not have high quality, since we assume that both parties are fluent, that the conversation flow is perfectly consistent, and there is no unexpected event (e.g. an interruption by another person, connection loss, etc.) in the middle of the conversation. Another limitation of our method is the difficulty of incorporating less tangible persona traits, such as a sense of humor, or user attributes that require multiple conversation sessions to be reflected. Ethics Statement The approach of generating datasets based on some desired objective might be used to create harmful datasets, and train malicious models based on them, such as a biased dataset, or a hateful speech one Hartvigsen et al. (2022). On the other hand, these datasets and models can be used as filters in application tasks. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk in our human experiments, and followed that platform’s guidelines to protect the rights of human raters. The participation was voluntary, and the raters were informed of their rights at the beginning of the study. The platform implemented security measures to protect them, and prevent the disclosure of any Personal Identifiable Information about them. Furthermore, we offered higher than minimum standard wage compensation to avoid any exploitative practices. To avoid having any toxic conversation in the final dataset, we also used several tools to remove any potentially toxic conversation. Details about these tools, and example removed samples are available in Appendix B.1.

Appendix A Dataset Generation Framework In this section, we provide more details on our synthetic dataset generation framework. We created Synthetic-Persona-Chat using an LLM with 24 billion parameters. We use top-k sampling with k=40 for decoding during generation, and set the temperature value to 0.7 in all components. We give more details on user and conversation generation components in the following subsections. A.1 User Generation In our framework, the user generation component consists of two steps: expanding the persona attribute set, and creating realistic user profiles. In this section we provide details on our framework for these two steps: Persona Expansion As described in Section 3.1.1, the persona expansion step involves identifying persona categories in the initial persona attribute set Π0, generating queries associated with those categories, and bootstrapping queries to create a query set Q. In our framework, we employ the Scikit-learn Pedregosa et al. (2011) implementation of an agglomerative clustering to identify persona categories following this clustering method: we represent each persona using a BERT-based representation. Our clustering approach is bottom-up, starting with each persona attribute as an individual cluster. At each step, we combine two clusters if their similarity exceeds a predetermined threshold of 0.1. The similarity of two clusters is measured using inter-cluster average cosine similarity. The process continues until no pair of clusters is more similar than the threshold. After identifying the clusters, we sample 3 instances of persona attributes for each cluster, and prompt the LLM using the template in shown in section 3 to construct an initial query set Q0. We expand the query set Q0 using bootstrapping. At each step, we sample 5 instances from the available queries, and prompt the LLM using the template in Table 6. We repeat this process for 100 steps. Examples of initial persona attributes, induced queries, bootstrapped queries, and bootstrapped persona attributes can be found in Table 4. The prompt templates used in this component are available in Table 6. User Profile Generation We illustrate a sample user profile creation process in Figure 6. As shown in the figure, at each iteration, a randomly selected persona attribute is checked for consistency and non-redundancy. Let π′ be a randomly selected persona attribute in an iteration. For the redundancy criteria, we use the BERT representation of persona attributes. We compute the similarity of the new candidate persona attribute π′ with every persona attribute in the user profile. If it is more than a threshold (0.9 in these experiments) similar to an attribute in the user profile, π′ is deemed as redundant and will not be added to the user profile. We use the cosine similarities of the BERT representations of the persona attributes. For the consistency criteria, we use the NLI model to verify the consistency of this persona attribute with the user profile. For every persona attribute in the current user profile π, we prompt the LLM to create the negated persona attribute ¬⁢π. Then, we query the NLI model to check whether ¬⁢π is inferred by π′ or ¬⁢π′ is inferred by π. If either of these cases is inferred, then the selected persona attribute is not consistent with the user profile, and not added to the profile. Dataset Persona Source Query Example Persona Attribute Persona-Chat Human What is your job? I am a pharmacist. Where do you live? I live close to the coast. Do you have any pets? I have a doberman. LLM What are your talents? I am a great listener. What is your hair color? My hair is auburn. What is your favorite song? I like the song \\"Leather and Lace\\". Wikipedia Human What are your hobbies? I spend WAY too much time on Wikipedia. What is your view on the metric system? I find the metric system to be a logical and efficient way to measure things. LLM What is the name of the first album you ever purchased? My first album was The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill What are you interested in? I’m looking to learn new recipes and improve my cooking skills. Table 4: Persona Categories and Induced Queries Using Our Framework. Queries are generated by the Large Language Model (LLM). Queries for personas with the \\"LLM\\" as source, are generated through bootstrapping, while those with \\"human\\" as source are generated by sampling persona categories and prompting the LLM. Personas with \\"human\\" as the source are authored by humans, while \\"LLM\\" rows represent personas generated using our framework. Refer to caption Figure 6: User Profile Construction Example A.2 Conversation Generation LLM-based Critic In our framework, the critic is implemented by prompting an LLM. We included a mixture of experts approach in the critic, where each expert prompts the LLM to assess a specific policy in the candidate conversations. Our framework includes a set of experts to control the general conversation quality. We evaluate the performance of these experts using a baseline dataset. The baseline dataset for this experiment is FED which consists of 125 human-annotated instances evaluated at the conversation level. We pair the conversations and evaluate the experts based on the number of correctly ranked pairs. As shown in Table 5, we observe that these experts are more than 80% accurate in distinguishing the better conversation within the pairs. The template for the verbalized form of these experts used in our framework can be found in Table 6. Policy Performance Depth 0.84 Coherency 0.96 Consistency 0.92 Diversity 0.92 Likable 0.88 Table 5: List of FED Experts for Persona-Based Conversation Generation Critic. Performance is measured by the number of correctly compared conversation pairs in FED baseline based on the given policy. Component Template Query Induction What is the most specific question that you are replying to with the following statements? {persona-category-sample-1} {persona-category-sample-2} {persona-category-sample-3} Query Bootstrapping {cluster-query-1} … {cluster-query-5} Add more persona questions similar to the above examples. Persona Bootstrapping Imagine you are a person with the following persona. {random-persona-attribute-1} … {random-persona-attribute-5} {query}. Answer with only one short sentence that starts with ’I’ or ’My’. Do not repeat the given persona. FED Expert Which one of Conversation 1 and Conversation 2 between two users {policy}? Why? Conversation 1: {conv-1} Conversation 2: {conv-2} Toxicity Expert Is this conversation toxic? Why? Conversation: {conv} Conversation Generation Here, we list the profiles of two users, user 1 and user 2, followed by an interesting and natural conversation between user 1 and user 2, which implicitly reflects their user profiles. User 1 Profile: {conversation1-user-1} User 2 Profile: {conversation1-user-2} Conversation: {conversation-1} … User 1 Profile: {conversation-5-user-1} User 2 Profile: {conversation-5-user-2} Conversation: {conversation-5} Give me more examples like this. The conversation must be more than 5 turns and less than 8 turns. The conversation must be natural, and not direct copies of their profiles. User 1 Profile: {user-1} User 2 Profile: {user-2} Faithfulness Expert Given user 1 and user 2’s profiles respectively, does the following conversation between the two users contradict either of their profiles? Why? User 1 Profile: {user-1} User 2 Profile: {user-2} Conversation: {conv-1} Response: {explanation} Table 6: Prompting Templates for Large Language Models of Different Components in Our Framework. Variables enclosed in {} are filled when the template is populated. We also included a toxicity expert and a persona faithfulness expert in the critic. The prompt templates used in these experts are available in Table 6. The persona faithfulness leverages in-context- learning capability of LLMs. It includes a few human-curated examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations in the instruction prompt. Refer to Table 7 for examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations used in the instruction prompt. User Profiles Conversations Faithfulness Explanation User 1: One of my favorite hobbies is gaming. I currently work in an office. I enjoy running User 2: I am applying for publishing jobs. My mother is a librarian. The only autographs I’ve ever wanted are from authors. I used to wear glasses as a child. My favorite color is green. User 1: Do you like video games? User 2: No, I do not like video games. User 1: What do you do for a living? User 2: I am a librarian. User 1: I guess that is why you like to read a lot. User 2: Yes, I like to read books. User 1: What is your favorite color? Mine is green. User 2: That is my favorite color too. User 1: That is cool. User 2: Do you have any pets? User 1: No, I do not have any pets. User 2: I have a dog and a cat. User 1: That is cool. User 2: Do you have any hobbies?. User 1: Yes, I like to write. User 2: What do you write about? User 1: I write about my life. User 2: That is cool. User 1: Thanks! No, the conversation does not contradict the profiles. Neither user 1 nor user 2 says anything that contradicts their respective profiles. Although the conversation does not cover everything in their profiles, that is ok. User 1: I would like to move some place warmer. I m an out of work farmhand. I like watching reality television shows. I live in Kansas. User 2: I am studying to be a dentist. My favorite team is the raptors. My favorite band is rise against. I usually go to bed late. I like sports. User 1: It’s so cold in Kansas, I want to go some place warmer. User 2: I am studying dentistry. User 1: I am an out of work farmhand, I love reality tv. User 2: I like the raptors and rise against, I go to bed late. User 1: It is very hard to find work here, I might need to go to the city. User 2: I don’t like sports , but I like the raptors . User 1: I would like to work as a model, but I have no experience. User 2: I am applying for a job as a receptionist. User 1: I am very jealous, I hope you get it. Yes, the conversation contradicts user 2’s profile. In the profile, user 2 says they like sports, however, in the conversation, user 2 says they don’t like sports. User 1: My family is from Kazakhstan. I can speak Spanish, English, and Kazakh. I like to go hiking on the weekends. I play jazz piano in a band. I am a barista. User 2: I am a vegan. I love game of thrones. I like soccer. My brother used to be in the navy. User 1: Hi, what do you do for a living? User 2: I am a barista. User 1: Awesome, me too! Where are you from? User 2: My family is from Kazakhstan, but I was born in Uruguay. User 1: Cool . What do you like to do in your free time? User 2: I love to go hiking and play jazz piano. User 1: Wow, that sounds really nice. I like to watch game of thrones and play soccer. User 2: I have never seen game of thrones, but I love soccer. User 1: You should watch it, it is really good. User 2: I will check it out. Yes, the conversation contradicts user 2’s profile. In the profile, user 2 says they love game of thrones, but in the conversation user 2 says they have never seen it. User 1: My favorite book is David Copperfield. I have a twin brother. I am really short. I love to bake cakes. I have won tap dance competitions. User 2: I enjoy spending a lot of money on my hobbies. I love photography. I like to use candles instead of lights. I do not like waking up early. User 1: Hi there! Do you like to read? User 2: I like to read. I like to go to the library. User 1: Oh, cool! What is your favorite book? User 2: I really like David Copperfield. I have a twin brother and I am really short. User 1: Are you good at baking? User 2: I can bake cakes. I have won tap dance competitions. User 1: Do you like photography? User 2: I love taking pictures. I also like to use candles instead of lights. User 1: Do you like to wake up early? User 2: I like to sleep in. I do not like waking up early. User 1: Do you like to spend money? User 2: I love spending money on my hobbies. No, the conversation does not contradict either user profiles. Although user 2 says they are really short, which is in user 1’s profile, it doesn’t mean user 2 cannot be really short too. Table 7: Examples of Faithful and Unfaithful Conversations for Prompting the Persona Faithfulness Expert in Our Framework. The ‘Faithfulness explanation’ columns are used to fill the ‘explanation’ variable in the faithfulness expert template. Appendix B Synthetic-Persona-Chat Synthetic-Persona-Chat is made of 20k conversations, with an average of 11.8 turns per user for each. An example Synthetic-Persona-Chat conversation can be found in Table 8. We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat to Persona-Chat across different dimensions. We first assess the characteristics of SPC using various automatic evaluators, i.e. evaluators which do not require human effort. We then conduct a human evaluation experiment on a subset of SPC. User Profiles Conversation User 1 I am male. My weakness are sweets. I am unsociable. I am a jack of all, master of none. User 2 My favorite music is rock and roll. I love to travel. I am from Russia. I enjoy skiing. I go to school for business. User 1: Hello User 2: Hello, what’s your name? User 1: My name is [name], and you? User 2: My name is [name], I’m from Russia. User 1: Nice to meet you, [name]. I’m from the United States. User 2: It’s nice to meet you too, [name]. What are you interested in? User 1: I’m interested in a lot of things, but my main interests are music and travel. User 2: I love music too! What kind of music do you like? User 1: I like a lot of different kinds of music, but my favorite is rock and roll. User 2: Me too! I love classic rock and roll. Who are your favorite bands? User 1: My favorite bands are The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin. User 2: Those are all great bands! I love them too. User 1: What about you, what are your favorite bands? User 2: My favorite bands are The Doors, Pink Floyd, and Queen. User 1: Those are all great bands too! I love them too. User 2: So, what do you like to do for fun? User 1: I like to go to concerts, play video games, and watch movies. User 2: I love going to concerts too! I also like to go skiing and play tennis. User 1: I love skiing too! I haven’t played tennis in a while, but I used to play a lot. User 2: We should go skiing together sometime! User 1: That would be fun! I’m free this weekend if you are. User 2: I’m free this weekend too! We should go skiing. User 1: Great! I’ll text you the details. Table 8: Sample Conversation from Synthetic-Persona-Chat. This conversation was synthesized from user profiles in Persona-Chat B.1 Automatic Evaluation We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of SPC across different dimensions and compare it against PC. We start by analyzing the toxicity and diversity of SPC using off the shelf tools. Then, we elaborate on the experiments which assess the efficacy of SPC used as the dataset for the next utterance prediction and the profile extraction tasks. Finally, we evaluate the quality of SPC conversations using LLM-based evaluation methods. Toxicity Analysis We analyze the toxicity of the generated conversations at the final iteration of SPC using an online tool called Perspective3 3 https://perspectiveapi.com/. We reproduce the results of a detailed analysis of toxicity in PC as well as in each iteration of our data generation framework while producing SPC in Table 9. Toxicity Profanity Confidence weak(< .2) medium(.2-.8) strong(>.8) weak(< .2) medium(.2-.8) strong(>.8) PC 10875 4448 53 10891 1676 57 SPC Iter 1 10902 1192 3 10903 340 3 SPC Iter 2 10900 1096 1 10901 345 1 SPC Iter 3 10902 1088 1 10902 376 0 Table 9: Frequency of Toxic Conversations in Persona-Chat and Synthetic-Persona-Chat We observe a notable reduction in the frequency of conversations deemed as strongly toxic or profane throughout the iterations of generating SPC. This reduction can be attributed to the built-in toxicity filter of the employed LLM. While PC contains more than 50 samples that are identified as strongly toxic, SPC includes at most three toxic or profane conversations, which is significantly lower (at least 15 times less). Interestingly, the fraction of conversations with medium profanity and toxicity in SPC is 4 times less than the same type of conversations in PC across all iterations. We have removed any conversation that was marked as strongly toxic by this tool in the released dataset. Samples of toxic conversations are provided in Table 10. Source Conversation Persona-Chat … User 1: I like bloody stuff. User 2: It reminds me of the dark which makes me afraid of it. User 1: You are a silly goose. Persona-Chat … User 2: Cool. Why do you say that? Because I am a red head? User 1: No. Ikn. Why do you ask so many questions? Mr. Thomas is dumb. Synthetic-Persona-Chat User 1: I can imagine. What’s your favorite part of the job? User 2: I love working with my team and seeing our restaurant succeed. User 1: That’s great. What’s your least favorite part of the job? User2: My least favorite part is dealing with my boss. He’s a real jerk. Table 10: Examples of Toxic Conversations. The first two examples are segments of conversations from Persona-Chat. The final example is a segment from a toxic conversation in Synthetic-Persona-Chat, which has been removed in the released dataset. Diversity Analysis We use hierarchical topic modeling Blei et al. (2004) to assess the topic diversity of SPC and compare it to that of PC. For a fair comparison, we only compare conversations in SPC with similar personas in PC. Table 11 displays the number of topics at each level of the topic tree, with the first level indicating the most general topic. We observe similar topic diversity at the first level. In deeper levels, there is a slightly lower diversity in SPC. Topic Level PC SPC 1 27 27 2 232 213 3 470 403 4 137 118 5 30 26 Table 11: Vertical Topic Diversity in Persona-based Datasets Next Utterance Prediction We compare the performance of different models on the next utterance prediction task. As discussed in Section 4.2, these models are expected to exhibit better performance in the next utterance prediction task when user personas are provided as prior information. We evaluate ranking and generative models for response selection to assess this property. We compare models trained on SPC to the same models trained on PC. We use the implementations provided in Miller et al. (2017) for the following models: • IR Baseline Given an utterance as a query, the IR baseline finds the most similar utterance in the training corpus using tf-idf. It defines the utterance after the most similar utterance as the candidate response, and then returns the most similar option to that candidate as the output. • Transformer-Ranker The context of the conversation, as well as the candidate next utterances, are encoded using a BERT-based encoder. The most similar encoded candidate to the conversation context, as measured by a dot-product in their representation space, is selected as the output Humeau et al. (2020). • Transformer-Generator This model is a sequence-to-sequence model Sutskever et al. (2014) which uses transformers as encoders and decoders. Persona-Chat Synthetic-Persona-Chat Method Metric No Persona Self Persona Their Persona Both Personas No Persona Self Persona Their Persona Both Personas IR baseline hit@1 0.1869 0.3683 0.1519 0.3281 0.1861 0.2596 0.1882 0.2493 Transformer(Ranker) hit@1 0.2513 0.275 0.1922 0.2572 0.7164 0.6227 0.6988 0.7214 Transformer hit@1 0.0896 0.08512 0.0873 0.0813 0.0526 0.629 0.053 0.051 (Generator) ppl 65.57 72.24 62.49 64.07 5.54 5.47 5.4 5.405 Table 12: Evaluation of Next Utterance Prediction models conditioned on different user personas. We also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results of this experiment are available in Table 12. We observe that the highest performance improvement for all models trained on PC is when self-personas are given as input. We do not observe such a pattern in SPC. This indicates a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC conversations compared to those of PC. Profile Extraction A potential use-case of the SPC dataset is training a model to predict user personas from a conversation. This is only possible if the dataset is highly faithful, meaning that any persona attribute inferred from the conversation is in the user profile or compatible with the user profile. In this context, a faithful conversation is expected to have high precision in the profile extraction task, while a conversation that highly reflects user personas is expected to have high recall in this task. We evaluate the task of user profile extraction for conversations in SPC, and compare the results against those of PC. We frame the task of profile extraction as a ranking task, using the utterances within the conversations as queries. The goal is to rank a set of persona attribute options. For each conversation, we include the speakers’ persona attributes in the available options. Additionally, we select 25 random user persona attributes from other speaker profiles within the dataset to serve as distractors. The input to the profile extraction is utterances from a single user as the speaker, while the output is a list of persona attribute options for a target user, which could be either user 1 or user 2. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 13. We observe that the performance of the profile extraction methods is higher in SPC in 3 of the 4 scenarios. Interestingly, we observe that with both datasets, when the target and the speaker are different, the performance of profile extraction is greater compared to the cases when the target and speaker users are the same. F-Score Target Speaker PC SPC user 1 user 1 0.505 0.574 user 1 user 2 0.737 0.68 user 2 user 1 0.50 0.57 user 2 user 2 0.456 0.494 Table 13: Accuracy of Profile Extraction in Four Different Scenarios. The ‘Target’ column represents the user profile to be extracted, while the ‘Speaker’ column indicates the speaker of the turns given to the model as input. LLM-based Quality Evaluation We leverage LLM-based conversation quality evaluators from the literature to compare the quality of SPC and PC. These evaluators rely on the human curated prompt templates for different metrics including consistency, fluency, etc. We used these evaluators with minimum change in the original prompt templates. These evaluators are: • LLM-Eval Lin and Chen (2023) is a multi-dimensional automatic evaluation designed for conversations. It uses a human-curated prompt which describes evaluation dimensions, serving as a unified evaluation schema. This prompt evaluates the conversation across multiple dimensions (e.g. fluency) in a single model call. We show this unified schema in Table 14. • GPT-Score Fu et al. (2023) leverages emergent abilities of LLMs, i.e. zero-shot instructions, to score texts. It contains a prompt template, and for each quality criterion, populates the template with a human description of the criteria along with the valid score range for that criteria. Example prompts are provided in Table 14. • G-Eval Liu et al. (2023) introduces a framework that employs LLMs with a chain-of-thought approach to assess the quality of natural language generated outputs. For any evaluation criteria, G-Eval prompts the LLM with the criterion’s description, prompting the model to generate the necessary evaluation steps. It then uses these steps to prompt the LLM to score given output for that criterion. It considers the probability of getting each permissible score as the output of the prompt, i.e., it considers the probability distribution of scores assigned by the LLM. The reported output is the expected value of the score distribution by the LLM. Table 14 includes an example prompt. Evaluator Metric Prompt Template LLM-Eval All Human: The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below. As an example, for the schema {\\"properties\\": {\\"foo\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Foo\\", \\"description\\": \\"a list of strings\\", \\"type\\": \\"array\\", \\"items\\": {\\"type\\": \\"string\\"}}}, \\"required\\": [\\"foo\\"]}} the object {\\"foo\\": [\\"bar\\", \\"baz\\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\\"properties\\": {\\"foo\\": [\\"bar\\", \\"baz\\"]}} is not well-formatted. Here is the output schema: {\\"properties\\": {\\"content\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Content\\", \\"description\\": \\"content score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}, \\"grammar\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Grammar\\", \\"description\\": \\"grammar score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}, \\"relevance\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Relevance\\", \\"description\\": \\"relevance score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}, \\"appropriateness\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Appropriateness\\", \\"description\\": \\"appropriateness score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}}, \\"required\\": [\\"content\\", \\"grammar\\", \\"relevance\\", \\"appropriateness\\"]} Score the following dialogue generated on a continuous scale from {score-min} to {score-max}. Dialogue: {dialogue} GPT-Score Consistency Answer the question based on the conversation between two users. Question: Are the responses of users consistent in the information they provide throughout the conversation? (a) Yes. (b) No. Conversation: {dialogue} Answer: G-Eval Coherence You will be given a pair of user personas. You will then be given one conversation between this persona pair. Your task is to rate the conversation on one metric. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed. Evaluation Criteria: Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all utterances. We align this dimension with the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) quality question of structure and coherence (https://duc.nist.gov/duc2007/quality-questions.txt), whereby \\"the conversation should be well-structured and well-organized. The conversation should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from utterance to a coherent body of conversation about a topic.\\" Evaluation Steps: 1. Read and understand the given conversation between the pair of user personas. 2. Evaluate the conversation based on the coherence of the utterances. 3. Rate the conversation on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest coherence and 1 being the lowest coherence. 4. Justify the rating by referring to specific aspects of the conversation that demonstrate its coherence or lack thereof. Example: Personas: {personas} Conversation: {dialogue} Evaluation Form (scores ONLY): - Coherence: LLM-Faithfulness Inference Instruction: Select User {user} persona attributes that are directly inferred from this conversation. Contradiction Instruction: Select User {user} persona attributes that strongly contradict this conversation. Table 14: Prompt Templates in LLM-based Conversation Quality Evaluators. Variables enclosed in {} are filled when the template is populated. Results of this evaluation are presented in Table 15. We observe that SPC consistently outperforms PC across all the dimensions we evaluate. The superiority of SPC is more prominent when using GPT-Score, for which each evaluated criterion shows an average improvement of at least 23 points.

B.2 Human Evaluation We run a human evaluation of the performance of our method via a crowdsourcing platform. We conduct a Turing test, and a faithfulness study - both of which we describe in more details in the following subsections - at the end of every iteration of the generation of SPC. Turing Test We randomly select 200 user pairs from PC. For each example, we show the annotators the user pair, together with the corresponding conversations from PC and SPC, and ask them to select the conversation that was synthetically generated. We show an example of this crowdsourcing task in Figure 7. The results of the Turing test are available in Table 16. We report the losing rate of SPC in Turing test, and Fleiss’ Kappa to assess the inter-rater agreement. The agreement falls into the fair to moderate agreement bucket. Refer to caption Figure 7: Preview of the Turing Test Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform Conversation Source % Lose κ # annotators SPC Iter 1 17.2 0.41 50 SPC Iter 2 18.5 0.48 40 SPC Iter 3 8.8 0.22 11 SPC Iter 3* 8.04 0.56 24 SPC (LLM2) 11.5 0.49 36 Table 16: Turing test results on a sample of 200 conversations. The first column shows the percentage of SPC losing compared to PC in the Turing test. Note that the last iteration (3) of SPC is an evaluation of the segment of conversations based on the extended persona set. Faithfulness We present the annotators with a conversation, and a set of options of persona attributes. The annotators are asked to select the user persona attributes they would infer from the conversation. Figure 8 shows a sample of the annotation task in this study. The options include the persona attributes of the speakers in the conversation, and a set of distractor persona attributes. We created distractor persona attributes using different strategies to cover different difficulty levels. For a persona attribute set Π, we create a set ¬⁢Π of distractor persona attributes as: Negated personas We prompt an LLM to negate persona attributes. For example, the negation of persona attribute \\"I like vegetables\\" is \\"I don’t like vegetables\\". Random personas We randomly select persona attributes from user profiles in other conversations in the dataset. Contradicting personas We prompt an LLM to generate a persona attribute which contradicts the users’ personas. Each entry of this task includes 8 user persona attributes as options, where 4 of them are the real persona attributes, and the other 4 are distractors. We evaluate the precision of the human annotators, and report it as a proxy to the conversation faithfulness in Table 3. Refer to caption Figure 8: Preview of the Faithfulness Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform. Appendix C Ablation Studies We run several ablation studies to evaluate the importance of individual components in our framework. We begin by analyzing the effect of the persona expansion module. We then review the impact of each expert in the mixture forming our Critic. C.1 Persona Expansion We assess the importance of the query-based persona expansion module introduced in Section 3.1.1. Similarly to the experiment outlined in Section 4.1, we run the persona expansion on two datasets: Wikipedia and PC. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 17. We designate the persona expansions without the inducted query set (Q) as ‘Wikipedia-0’, and ‘PC-0’, and run the same number of iterations for each (100 iterations). We observe that PC-0 includes 4,477 new persona attributes, 20 percent less than PC. The difference in the number of newly generated persona attributes is more pronounced in the case of Wikipedia, where Wikipedia-0 consists of 4,742 persona attributes, 50 percent less than Wikipedia+. This trend is also observed in the number of persona clusters, with PC-0 and Wikipedia-0 having 6% and 49% less clusters respectively. This pattern suggests the effectiveness of the query-based persona expansion in maintaining the diversity of the persona set. Furthermore, the average persona attribute length in PC-0 is 11.38 tokens, which is 28% less than SPC. This reduction points to less detailed and specific persona attributes. In contrast, the expansion in ‘Wikipedia-0’ exhibits similar average persona attribute lengths compared to ‘Wikipedia+’. Dataset PC SPC PC-0 Wikipedia Wikipedia+ Wikipedia-0 # Persona Attributes 4,723 10,371 9,200 8,768 18,293 13,510 # Clusters 323 553 520 408 986 502 InterCluster-Dist 0.836 0.863 0.842 0.816 0.85 0.83 AVG length 7.65 15.9* 11.38* 10.45 15.2* 15.2* Table 17: Evaluation of the Expanded Persona Attribute Sets. The numbers with *′′ indicate the metric value on the newly generated persona attributes, in contrast to the initial persona attributes. C.2 Conversation Quality We analyze the effect of the experts within our Critic. We remove each expert, and generate a dataset using one iteration of our framework. We compare the resulting datasets against the output of the first iteration of SPC. We use the evaluators introduced in B.1. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 15. We observe that the exclusion of the experts results in worse performance according to most criteria: 3 out of 4 in LLM-Eval, 4 out of 6 in GPT-Score, and 3 out of 5 in G-Eval. C.3 Faithfulness We ablate the faithfulness critic, and generate a dataset that we compare against SPC. We compare these datasets both automatically, using human annotators (Turing Test), and using a prompted LLM (LLM-Evaluator). We describe this study in more details below. Turing Test We run a human study to compare a small subset of conversations created without the faithfulness expert against their equivalent created with that expert. This experiment process is similar to 4.3 and it is conducted for 200 conversations. The precision decreases from 78.0% to 66.0% without this critic, highlighting its effectiveness in eliminating conversations with contradictory information about user personas. The recall decreases from 36.0% to 23.0%, demonstrating a higher reflection of personas in the conversations in the presence of the faithfulness expert. LLM-Evaluator We extend our comparison to the entire dataset using an LLM as an annotator, following He et al. (2023); Bansal and Sharma (2023); Chiang and yi Lee (2023). Table 18 shows the faithfulness of the conversations generated in the first iteration without the faithfulness expert. The templates used in the LLM-based annotators are described in Table 15 in the rows with \\"LLM-Faithfulness\\" as their evaluator. Note that the annotator-based LLM is created using a different LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo Brown et al. (2020a); Ouyang et al. (2022), than the LLM used for dataset generation. LLM Evaluator (%) Human Evaluator (%) Absent Component Inference Contradiction Precision Recall None 33.2 24.5 78.5 36.4 Faithfulness 32.7 28.8 66.1 23.1 FED 31.7 28.5 N/A N/A Table 18: Faithfulness of Generated Conversation Datasets Using the Framework While Eliminating Each Component. The first row represents the framework without removing any component, equivalent to the first iteration of Synthetic-Persona-Chat. C.4 Next Utterance Prediction We follow the experimental setting described in section 4.2, and compare the performance of various next utterance prediction models trained on SPC against the same models trained on datasets created in the absence of certain experts. When using the IR Baseline as the next utterance prediction method, we observee that its highest performance of 39% hit@1 occurs when the FED critic is absent during dataset creation. This outcome aligns with FED’s emphasis on conversation quality, excluding persona-related aspects. Conversely, the Transformer Ranker, capable of understanding intricate concepts, achieves its peak performance of 13.9% hit@1 when none of the experts are absent. This result supports the inclusion of both FED and the Faithfulness expert in the model architecture. In generative models, the absence of FED impacts the next utterance prediction model the most, leading to a notable decline in performance (e.g. −12% hit@1, −9% BLEU, −10% ROUGE). This observation underscores the crucial role played by FED in enhancing the generative capabilities of the model. Absent Component Faithfulness FED None Method Metric None Persona % Change None Persona % Change None Persona % Change IR Baseline hit@1 18.7 38.7 +106 19.0 39.0 +105 18.9 38.7 +105 Transformer (Ranker) hit@1 10.9 13.5 +24 10.7 13.6 +27 12.4 13.9 +11 hit@1 8.9 7.4 -16 8.4 7.4 -12 8.2 7.0 -14 Transformer Perplexity 204 214 +5 174 185 +6 203 210 +3 (Generator) BLUE 0.11 0.10 -11 0.11 0.10 -9 0.10 0.08 -15 ROUGE 0.14 0.15 -12 0.14 0.12 -10 0.13 0.10 -17 Table 19: Results of the Next Utterance Prediction Experiment in the Ablation Study.

Here's a detailed, multi-step prompt specifically designed to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) through generating expanded personas, pairing users with complementary or overlapping interests, and creating a nuanced Hinglish dialogue between them. This prompt ensures a logical flow from generating individual personas to crafting a conversation that reflects their personalities and interests. --- **Step 1: Generate Persona Attributes** Prompt for LLM: \\"Create two distinct personas based on the initial attributes provided below. For each persona, expand by adding five more attributes that delve deeper into their interests, lifestyle, and profession, ensuring a rich, multi-dimensional character profile suitable for engaging conversations. Make sure the expanded attributes complement the initial ones, providing a coherent and fuller picture of each persona’s life and preferences.\\" **Initial Attributes:** **Persona 1:** - Loves playing cricket on weekends. - Enjoys street food in Delhi’s markets. - Favors Bollywood movies. - Works as a software developer in Gurgaon. **Persona 2:** - Avid reader of mystery novels. - Passionate about cooking traditional Indian dishes. - Freelance graphic designer. - Enjoys Indian classical music. **Step 2: Persona Expansion** Prompt for LLM: \\"Based on the initial attributes and your creative expansion, further elaborate on each persona's background. For Persona 1, incorporate an aspect relating to their social life, technological interests, and entertainment preferences. For Persona 2, expand on their creative passions, cultural engagements, and literary endeavors. Aim for richly detailed descriptions that could naturally lead to engaging dialogue points in a conversation.\\" **Step 3: User Pairing** Prompt for LLM: \\"Analyze the expanded attributes of both personas. Identify and list overlapping interests and potential points of discussion that could arise from their interactions. Highlight these commonalities and differences as the basis for pairing these two personas for a simulated conversation. Provide a brief rationale for why these two personas would find each other's company engaging and worthwhile.\\" **Step 4: Conversation Generation** Prompt for LLM: \\"Use the detailed personas and the pairing rationale to generate a conversation in Hinglish between the two users. Ensure that the dialogue reflects their shared interests, individual hobbies, and cultural backgrounds. Incorporate references to their professional lives, personal passions, and any amusing anecdotes or expressions typical in a friendly banter in India. The conversation should flow naturally, showcasing the connection between the two individuals while subtly highlighting the unique traits of their personas.\\" --- This structured approach nudges the LLM to systematically build up from creating detailed personas based on initial seed attributes to realizing a dynamic, culturally rich conversation that mirrors natural human interactions."},{"prompt":"Make somwthing like this, it necessary has to generate same persona but different output: Domain: Calculus RULES FOR FUNCTION CALLING: Function definition should include a clear schema or structure for the expected input data. Function's input parameters should be well-defined, with clear descriptions and data types. Function should be designed to perform a specific task that can be effectively handled. The user's input should be analysed to determine the relevant function and its required arguments. Output should strictly adhere to the provided schema, including required fields and correct data types. You should handle any potential ambiguities or missing information in the user's input gracefully. You should be capable of understanding and generating output for multiple function definitions simultaneously. Handle any formatting or preprocessing requirements for the function inputs or outputs.

IF you call the correct function but with the wrong arguments, you should return an error message indicating the incorrect arguments instead of providing the correct result. IF you initially call the wrong function based on the user's input, the user will point out the mistake. In this case, you should acknowledge the correction and call the correct function without requiring additional input from the user. IF you call the correct function but with the wrong arguments, you should realize the mistake on your own and call the function again with the correct arguments, without requiring the user to point out the mistake. Assistant MUST NOT acknowledge that it made any mistake. The user MUST point out the mistake made by the assistant in the function call. In the subsequent response, the assistant should: Correct the mistake in the function call, ensuring proper argument naming and casing. Enclose the corrected function call within <tool_call> tags. Include the output of the corrected function call within <tool_response> tags. Provide an explanation acknowledging the correction and the importance of consistent argument naming and casing. The assistant's responses should be natural language explanations, providing context and clarification for the function calls and their outputs. The JSON output should be well-formatted, with proper indentation and escaping of special characters. The conversation flow should be logical and consistent, with the assistant demonstrating the ability to understand and adapt to the user's feedback and corrections.

One way to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user is through personas, aspects of the user’s character that provide insights into their personality, motivations, and behaviors. Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead to conversational models that create a deeper connection with the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed dataset. We propose a Generator-Critic architecture framework to expand the initial dataset, while improving the quality of its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to output conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations. These experts select the best generated conversations, which we then use to improve the Generator. We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat1 1 Dataset available at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations seeded from Persona-Chat Zhang et al. (2018). We evaluate the quality of Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on different dimensions through extensive experiments, and observe that the losing rate of Synthetic-Persona-Chat against Persona-Chat during Turing test decreases from 17.2% to 8.8% over three iterations. 1 Introduction Every person is a story. Systems that interact with people must understand their underlying stories to effectively engage with them. Unfortunately, many existing datasets used for training conversational agents do not sufficiently model their users. Personas - abstract user representations that express the “story” of a person based on their background and preferences - have been widely used for human-centered design in a variety of domains, including marketing, system design, and healthcare Pruitt and Grudin (2003b). Prior persona-based conversational datasets, like Persona-Chat (PC) Zhang et al. (2018), suffer from several limitations, such as small size, static dialogues that cannot easily be updated with new topics, irrelevant utterances, and contradictory persona attributes Wu et al. (2019). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for generating large, dynamic, persona-based conversational datasets that capture the breadth and depth of human experience. Personas Pruitt and Grudin (2003a); Cooper and Saffo (1999) have been widely used in a variety of domains and applications, including creating narratives for patients and sharing educational messages in healthcare Massey et al. (2021), targeting users in marketing van Pinxteren et al. (2020); Fuglerud et al. (2020), and communicating with workers in management Claus (2019). Conversational agents use personas to generate more interesting and engaging conversations with their users Zhou et al. (2019); Shum et al. (2019). Creating persona-based datasets is difficult: the process is labor-intensive, the outputs must be updated to reflect current events and new concepts, and there are often quality concerns. Existing persona-based datasets have resulted from labor-intensive data collection processes Zhang et al. (2018); Zhong et al. (2020) involving humans to create or validate personas, create fictional persona-based conversations, and ensure the conversations are coherent. Moreover, even after these datasets are created, it is difficult to update them with the latest topics Lee et al. (2022), such as current events, new concepts, products, or social trends Lazaridou et al. (2021). Finally, existing persona-based datasets do not guarantee faithfulness, a criterion we introduce to describe the alignment between participants’ utterances and their personas. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for generating large, customized persona-based conversational datasets that uses unsupervised LLMs to reduce human labor, introduces methods to generate, expand, and update personas automatically, and enforces a set of quality criteria including faithfulness to ensure dialogues are human-like. Our persona-based conversational dataset generation framework consists of a three-level pipeline: 1. User Generation 2. User Pairing 3. Conversation Generation The user generation step takes a set of seed personas, and augments it to create plausible user profiles. The user pairing step matches users to participate in conversations. The conversation generation produces plausible conversations between the selected user pairs. The conversation generation component uses a method similar to self-feedback Madaan et al. (2023) to iteratively improve the quality of generated samples. We used the proposed framework to create Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC), a conversational dataset with 5⁢k user personas, and 20⁢k faithful dialogues. The framework we defined to create this dataset can be reused to define specialized personas, such as user music profiles, etc. to create application-specific datasets. Our contributions are: • We propose an unsupervised approach to generate, and extend specialized personas using LLMs. • We introduce and evaluate a framework based on LLMs to evolve a dataset while imposing different objectives on it. • We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat, a high-quality, faithful, persona-based conversational dataset useful for several conversational tasks, such as training persona inference models. 2 Definitions We define the faithful persona-based dialogue generation task. We begin by defining the persona-based dialogue generation task. We then formally define the faithfulness criteria as a desired quality for the generated dialogues. Throughout this section, we use π to refer to persona attributes (individual sentences which, together, form the user persona), U to refer to user profiles, and D to refer to conversations (dialogues). Persona Attributes We define a user persona attribute as a sentence describing this user. \\"I like ice cream\\", \\"I have two brothers\\" and \\"My native language is Tamazight\\" are all examples of persona attributes. Let Ω be the universal set of persona attributes. Ω contains all natural language descriptions of all tangible features of any person, which is unbounded. Persona Categories To help organize the vast space of personas, we adopt the approach of Lee et al. (2022) who introduced persona categories. Persona categories are groups of persona attributes that describe the same semantic feature of the user. In our work, we associate each persona category with a corresponding query that can be answered with all persona attributes in that category. For example, job and family situation are persona categories, and corresponding queries might be “What is your occupation?”, and “Do you have a family?”. Persona Attribute Structure Persona attributes can overlap. For instance, the attribute \\"I introduced my kids to scuba diving at a young age\\" overlaps with the attribute \\"My eldest son goes to elementary school\\", since both include the \\"parenthood\\" feature of the user. Moreover, some persona attributes form a hierarchy, and some persona attributes are specific cases of other attributes. User Profile We define a user profile as a set of persona attributes that can be used to describe a user. For a realistic user, the persona attributes describing a user profile should not contradict each other, and be consistent. An arbitrary persona attribute set U⊂Ω is a consistent set of persona attribute if, and only if: ∀π1∈U,∄⁢Π2⊂U:(Π2≠∅)∧(Π2→¬⁢π1) Persona-based Conversation A persona-based conversation D contains utterances such that at least one persona attribute from each user profile can be inferred from it. For example, the persona attribute \\"I am a parent\\" can be inferred from the utterance \\"I just dropped off my son at school\\". A persona-based conversation model is a generative model that takes a pair of user profiles (U1, U2) as input, and returns a persona-based dialogue D between these two users. Faithfulness One crucial quality for a persona-based conversation is that it should align with the user profile. Inspired by Daheim et al. (2023) which introduces dialogue system faithfulness to the knowledge contained in relevant documents, we specify the criterion of faithfulness to characterize the alignment between the utterances of a user in a persona-based conversation and their profile. The faithfulness criterion enforces the constraint that the utterances of a user should not decrease the likelihood of their persona. This criterion assumes the existence of both a prior probability of persona attributes, and an inference model for determining the probability of persona attributes conditioned on utterances. Let M be such an inference model, (U1, U2) a pair of user profiles, and D a persona-based conversation between them. To be a faithful conversation based on M, D should not contain any contradicting evidence to the persona attributes of the speakers: passing the conversation D as input to the inference model M should not reduce the inference probability of persona attributes in either of the user profiles U1 or U2. In other words, the probability of any persona attribute in the user profiles based on conversation D should not be less than the probability of that persona attribute without any assumptions. Formally, we call a conversation D faithful with respect to the user profiles U1 and U2, and inference model M if the following condition holds: ∀π∈U1∪U2:PM⁢(π|D)≥PM⁢(π). Where PM⁢(π|D) indicates the probability that M infers the persona π given conversation D. We show examples of faithful, and unfaithful conversations in Figure 1. Refer to caption Figure 1: Unfaithful Conversation (Left): Loving steak is negatively correlated with the persona attribute \\"I am a vegetarian\\". Faithful Conversation (Right): It introduces no information that contradicts or weakens the user’s profile. 3 Method In this section, we introduce our method to generate persona-based conversations. We create such conversations with minimum human input, starting from an initial dataset. Our process consists of three steps, as shown in Figure 2: user generation, user pairing, and conversation generation. The first component augments a set of seed persona attributes Π0 into an expanded set of persona attributes Πe, from which it creates user profiles. The second component pairs user profiles as interlocutors of a conversation. The third and final component uses an iterative process to generate high-quality conversations among user profile pairs. We detail each of these components below. Refer to caption Figure 2: Dataset Augmentation Pipeline 3.1 User Generation The User Generation component is split into two sub-components: 1. Persona Expansion 2. User Profile Construction We bootstrap seed persona attributes by using various prompts Brown et al. (2020b) to generate new persona attributes in the Persona Expansion step (Refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the prompts used). We then create new user profiles by iteratively selecting random user persona attributes from the expanded persona attributes. We employ a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model to ensure the consistency of the constructed user profiles. 3.1.1 Persona Expansion We propose an unsupervised method to augment a set of seed persona attributes Π0 into a super-set Πe. Unlike previous approaches Lee et al. (2022), our method is independent of human knowledge or intervention, making it capable of creating specialized personas in new domains. We proceed in two steps: query induction, and persona bootstrapping. In the query induction phase, we identify persona categories in Π0, along with associated queries. We then expand these queries into a set Q that also covers unobserved persona categories. The persona bootstrapping step leverages the category-based query set Q, and the initial persona attribute seed set Π0 to generate new persona attributes. Both of these steps are based on the bootstrapping technique Yarowsky (1995), and involve prompting an LLM. We provide a detailed description of these two steps in the following. Query Induction As described in Section 2, each persona attribute belongs to at least one persona category, and each category is associated with a corresponding query that can be answered with persona attributes in that category. The query induction process initially identifies the queries associated with persona categories in Π0. It then bootstraps queries by feeding them to a prompted LLM to create more queries that are associated with unobserved categories, ultimately creating a query set Q. Including queries associated with unobserved persona categories facilitates the creation of a more diverse set of personas, and increases the scale of augmentation. The query induction relies on the following assumption: Assumption Let ℳ be an LLM, and let Γ be the set of all queries associated with all persona categories. If two persona attributes π1 and π2 belong to the same persona category, then there exists a query qℳ∈Γ such that π1 and π2 are ℳ’s output to qℳ. The persona attributes \\"I am a doctor\\" and \\"I am a truck driver\\", for instance, both belong to the \\"job\\" category, leading to the query \\"What is your job?\\". We use an agglomerative clustering method to identify the persona categories in Π0. Let C be an arbitrary persona cluster in Π0. To generate a query for C, we select a random subset of persona attributes in C, and create a prompt using these samples. We employ this strategy to generate queries for all the clusters identified in Π0, and create a set of queries, which we refer to as Q0. Details on the clustering, query induction, together with examples of clusters, persona attributes, and induced queries are available in Appendix A.1. We come up with queries for new, unobserved persona categories by bootstrapping the queries in Q0: starting from Q=Q0, we iteratively sample a set of queries from Q, and create a prompt by concatenating them. We then prompt the LLM to generate a new query, and add it to the query set Q, as shown in Figure 3. We generated a total of |Q|=188 queries. This set of category-specific queries Q is later used to guide the LLM to generate new persona attributes from the specified category. Thus, higher values of |Q| result in greater diversity within the expanded persona attribute set. Refer to caption Figure 3: Query Induction Steps Persona Bootstrapping We use the persona attribute seed set Π0 and category-specific queries Q to generate new persona attributes through a bootstrapping process. We initialize Π to Π0. At every iteration, we randomly select a subset of persona attributes from Π, and create a set of prompts as follows: we first concatenate a set of persona attributes s. For every query q∈Q, we then combine the concatenated samples s, and the query q to create a category-specific persona prompt. This prompt guides the LLM to generate a persona attribute for that persona category. The set of prompts obtained from this process is {s⁢q|q∈Q}. We only add a new persona attribute to the set if its BERT embeddings Devlin et al. (2019) are not too close from existing ones, so as to prevent the addition of duplicates. Each of these prompts is then fed to the LLM to create a new persona attribute, which is subsequently added to the set of persona attributes Π for the next iteration. We continue this iterative process until we have generated a total of 5k persona attributes. Figure 4 illustrates the persona bootstrapping process. Table 6 in the appendix contains the prompt template used in this component. Refer to caption Figure 4: Query-based Persona Bootstrapping Process 3.1.2 User Profile Construction We build user profiles incrementally by sampling persona attributes from Πe, and adding the eligible ones. A persona attribute is eligible if it adheres to the criteria of consistency and non-redundancy. In other words, it should not contradict any attribute already in the user profile, and it should not be inferred by other persona attribute. We assess the consistency and redundancy of user profiles by leveraging an NLI model, and persona attribute clustering, respectively. The NLI model we employ is based on T5 Raffel et al. (2019), and has been trained on the TRUE dataset Honovich et al. (2022). We create a user profile U by iteratively selecting a random candidate persona attribute π′∈Πe. We use the NLI model to assess whether π′ contradicts any persona attribute in the profile. This is determined by the condition: ∀π∈U:(π′↛¬⁢π)∧(π↛¬⁢π′), where → is an inference. Additionally, we evaluate the similarity of π′ to the persona attributes in U to prevent the addition of redundant attributes. We add π′ to U if it meets the consistency and non-redundancy criteria. We repeat this process until the user profile contains 5 persona attributes. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the user profile construction. 3.2 User Pairing In this component, we identify potential pairs of users for conversations. As the conversations are persona-based, we hypothesize that they will be more engaging if the users’ personas exhibit more commonalities. We assign a similarity score to every pair of user profiles (U1,U2), indicating their semantic similarity. We leverage BERT to represent the user profiles. The similarity between U1 and U2 is defined as: |{(π1,π2)|π1∈U1,π2∈U2,∃c:π1,π2∈c}| Where c is a persona attributes cluster. The semantic similarity is quantified by the number of common persona categories in the user profiles. We pair U1 and U2 if their similarity exceeds a threshold of 2. 3.3 Conversation Generation Our Conversation Generation component is similar to a general-purpose dataset generation framework that generates data samples, and refines them based on a set of predefined criteria, which we refer to as policies Madaan et al. (2023). The flexibility in the choice of policies for data generation allows us to emphasize different objectives. Once the active policies are selected, this component generates new data samples using a few input samples. The input to our Conversation Generation framework consists of a set of paired user profiles, a few samples of user profiles along with a persona-based conversation between them, and conversation quality metrics as policies. We follow a Generator-Critic architecture, and iteratively create the dataset following the steps shown in Figure 5: Step 1 The Generator outputs candidate conversations between persona pairs using a few initial conversation samples. Step 2 The Critic evaluates the candidate conversations based on the predetermined policies, and selects the best candidate conversations. Step 3 The best candidate conversations are added to the dataset for the next iteration of generation. This iterative process of selecting the top candidates and adding them to the dataset gradually improves the performance of the Generator. Without any loss of generality, we implement both the Generator and the Critic based on LLMs. Specifically, the Generator prompts an LLM to create candidate conversations, while the Critic prompts an LLM to evaluate the quality of the generated conversations. We provide more details on the Generator, Critic, and the policies we used. Refer to caption Figure 5: The Generator-Critic Architecture for Conversation Generation The Generator outputs conversations for pairs of users (U1,U2) by prompting an LLM Brown et al. (2020b); Wei et al. (2023). At each iteration, it randomly selects 5 samples from an initial set of conversations, each containing a pair of user profiles and a dialogue among them. It feeds these samples to a template that instructs the LLM to generate a series of candidate conversations for the given user pair. The template, and a sample generated conversation are available in Table 6, and Table 8 in the appendix. The Critic selects the best generated conversations to fine-tune the Generator. A conversation is deemed high-quality if it complies with the policies of the Critic. Given the multifaceted nature of the conversation evaluations, we use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach. Each expert evaluates the conversation based on a specific policy. In this paper, we incorporate three types of experts, each with distinct criteria: general conversation quality, persona faithfulness, and toxicity. Collectively, these experts select the best generated conversations (the single best in our experiments). We describe each type of expert, and the collective decision-making process below. General Conversation Quality experts assess conversation quality using the Fine-grained Evaluation of Dialog (FED) metrics introduced in Mehri and Eskénazi (2020). These experts use verbalized forms of the policies from FED as prompts. For instance, the \\"conversation depth quality expert\\" transforms the \\"depth policy\\" from FED into a prompt like \\"Which conversation is a deeper conversation between user 1 and user 2?\\". Our system instructs the LLM to compare each pair of candidate conversations based on these policies, resulting in pairwise comparisons. The list of policies and their baseline performance are presented in Table 5 in Appendix A.2. The Faithfulness expert ensures the consistency of the generated conversations with the user profiles. It uses an LLM to identify instances of unfaithful conversations. The faithfulness prompt provides the LLM with explicit instructions, user profiles, and human-curated examples of unfaithful conversations. The Toxicity expert detects any conversation that exhibits harmful traits, including bias and hate. The Critic filters unfaithful and toxic conversations out. It then selects the best conversations using a majority vote among the General Conversation Quality experts. The selected instances are added to the dataset for the next iteration of the Generator. 4 Evaluation We evaluate different aspects of our dataset generation framework, and the resulting dataset - referred to as Synthetic-Persona-Chat - which is created using an instruction fine-tuned LLM with 24 billion parameters Chung et al. (2022). We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC) against the widely used Persona-Chat (PC) dataset across different dimensions. We begin by evaluating the quality of the personas we generate. We then evaluate SPC using both automatic metrics, and human assessment. We analyze other aspects of SPC, such as toxicity and diversity in appendices B.1 and B.1. 4.1 Evaluation of the Expanded Personas We evaluate our persona expansion module on two seed datasets: Wikipedia, and Persona-Chat. The Wikipedia personas are created by crawling the 1,000 most active contributors2 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits, and extracting user boxes from their pages. We expand both datasets using our framework, and evaluate the expanded persona attribute sets using automatic metrics. Table 1 compares the original persona sets to the expanded ones on a few dimensions. We observe that our persona expansion increases the number of persona attributes in SPC by 119%, while maintaining the original persona categories and expanding them by 71% compared to the persona attributes in PC. Moreover, the lengths of the new generated persona attributes are 107% longer in SPC, indicating that the new personas exhibit greater detail and specificity. We observe a similar trend when applying our persona expansion to the Wikipedia persona set, with a 108% increase in the number of persona attributes, a 140% increase in persona categories, and a 45% growth in persona attribute lengths. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in expanding and diversifying persona sets.

The numbers with * indicate the metric value of the newly generated persona attributes to contrast with the initial set. 4.2 Next Utterance Prediction A persona-based conversation reflects the speaker’s persona explicitly or implicitly. Therefore, we expect the inclusion of information about speaker personas to enhance the performance of next utterance prediction models in such conversations. In this experiment, we assess the impact of incorporating speaker personas as prior information on both ranking, and generative - Transformer based Vaswani et al. (2017) - next utterance prediction models. We create a subset of SPC containing conversations among user pairs included in PC for a fair comparison. Persona-Chat Synthetic-Persona-Chat Method Metric None Persona % Change None Persona % Change IR Baseline hit@1 18.69 36.86 +97 19.37 (19.92) 39.6 (26.23) +104 (+31) Transformer (Ranker) hit@1 14.24 19.21 +35 9.71 (64.24) 11.74 (68.82) +21 (+7) Transformer (Generator) hit@1 8.54 6.78 -20 6.89 (41.32) 6.66 (37.35) -3 (-9) Perplexity 122.5 173.3 +41 1032 (5.24) 1126 (5.73) +9 (+9) BLUE 0.120 0.094 -21 0.097 (0.289) 0.083 (0.251) -14 (-13) ROUGE 0.141 0.113 -24 0.123 (0.348) 0.107 (0.309) -13 (-11) Table 2: Results of the next utterance prediction experiment. Performance of the trained model on the test split of Persona-Chat is represented by the numbers in the table, while the numbers in parentheses indicate results for the test split of Synthetic-Persona-Chat. We observe (Table 2) that the performance of ranking models increases when personas are given to the models as input for both datasets. Specifically, the Transformer (Ranker) model, known for its ability to capture conversational complexity, exhibits higher performance in SPC when evaluated on the SPC test set compared to the PC test set. However, it demonstrates relatively weaker performance when trained on the PC. This implies that SPC contains more intricate and coherent conversations. The Transformer (Ranker) trained on SPC achieves a hit@1 of 64.24 on SPC test, 350% higher than PC (14.24). This suggests that the Transformer model can more accurately predict the next utterance in SPC, pointing to a greater coherency in conversations. The performance of the Information Retrieval (IR) Baseline model is slightly higher for SPC: it rises by 31% when conditioned on user personas, which is lower than 97% improvement in PC. A key contributing factor for the performance improvement of the retrieval-based model (IR Baseline) on PC given the personas, is the participants’ tendency to copy persona words in the conversations, whereas in SPC the personas are more implicitly reflected in the conversations. The implicit reflection of personas in SPC, makes the task more challenging for word based retrieval models, necessitating reasoning that goes beyond word level. However, when the model is trained on SPC and tested on PC, the improvement is as high as when the model is trained on PC, i.e. 104% compared to 97%. The performance of generative models is low for this task since these models are not trained with the ranking objective. However, the performance difference while the models are conditioned on personas is lower for the model trained on SPC, with a 20% drop for the model trained on PC against 3% drop in the model trained on SPC. The increase in perplexity is 9% in SPC compared to 41% in PC. The lower rate of perplexity increase and performance drop of the model given user personas as input highlights the higher alignment of conversations with personas in SPC. We also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results suggest a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC. We refer the reader to the Appendix B.1 for more details. 4.3 Human Evaluation We compare the quality of the conversations generated by our framework against those in Persona-Chat. We randomly select 200 conversations from PC, together with their corresponding user pairs, and use our method to generate conversations among the same users. We start by following Gehrmann et al. (2019) in running a human experiment to try and detect AI-generated content. We conduct a Turing test where we present pairs of conversations to humans, and ask them to identify the synthetically generated one. This test is carried out on the generated conversations at the end of each iteration of creating SPC. We repeat the test for conversations generated for new persona pairs, which we refer to as iteration 3*, i.e. we pair each of these conversations with a random conversation from PC. For a robust evaluation, every pair of conversations is annotated by 3 human evaluators, and the majority vote is used as the final annotation. Details of this test are available in Appendix B.2. The results of this experiment can be found in Table 3. We observe that the losing rate of SPC is reduced by 48% from SPC Iter 1 to SPC Iter 3, and dropped below the rate of 10%. Interestingly, 91% of the conversations in SPC, which are synthetically generated, are judged as human-like as the conversations generated by humans. Moreover, conversations generated for new personas (Iteration 3*) are deemed artificial in only 8.04% of cases, showing that SPC is more realistic than PC. We also evaluate the faithfulness of the generated conversations. For each conversation, we provide annotators with a faithfulness annotation task including the speakers’ persona attributes and distractor persona attribute options as shown in Figure 8. We evaluate faithfulness during 3 iterations of conversation generation for the selected 200 user pairs, and the annotators evaluate the generated conversations for each pair in every iteration. The results show that, while improving the Turing test results, faithfulness of conversations are consistently higher than 75% with at most 3% variation in between iterations, indicating high faithfulness in all iterations. Finally, we assess the impact of LLM size on the quality of the generated dataset within our framework. We create a variant of SPC using an LLM with 540 billion parameters (LLM2). Table 3 presents human evaluations comparing the smaller LLM in multiple iterations to a single-iteration approach with LLM2. The larger model exhibits a 5% advantage in the Turing test over the first iteration of dataset generation over the smaller model. After two iterations, however, the multi-iteration approach outperforms the first iteration of the bigger model, showing our framework’s capacity for cost-effective, high-quality conversation generation.

(2021), generation Kim et al. (2023); Dong et al. (2023), and evaluation Zhang et al. (2019); Liu et al. (2023). One of the earliest works in this area Anaby-Tavor et al. (2019) used LLMs to create a large text dataset from a small, labeled one. This idea was followed by Wang et al. (2021); Schick and Schütze (2021) which leveraged LLMs to create datasets without any human data. Kumar et al. (2020) evaluated the performance of different LLMs on the data augmentation task. Several conversational dataset generation methods focused on the structure of the conversational data Dai et al. (2022); Leszczynski et al. (2023); Abbasiantaeb et al. (2023). Mehri et al. (2022) illustrated how Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively generate synthetic training data for task-oriented dialogue models. Persona-based conversations have been a popular research topic in NLP Liu et al. (2022). One of the earliest works in this area is Persona-Chat, by Zhang et al. (2018), which proposed the Persona-Chat dataset and evaluation metrics that have become a benchmark for persona-based conversation generation Mazaré et al. (2018). Many subsequent works have used this dataset to train and evaluate their models, including DialoGPT Zhang et al. (2020), BlenderBot Shuster et al. (2022), and PersonaChatGen Lee et al. (2022). PersonaChatGen automated the process of creating persona based conversations of Persona-Chat using LLMs. A challenge in generating synthetic datasets is to ensure the quality of the conversation including data faithfulness, fidelity, diversity, and consistency Li et al. (2016); Lee et al. (2023); Veselovsky et al. (2023); Zhuo et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023a); Mündler et al. (2023). Several works have focused on creating and using high quality training datasets Welleck et al. (2019), and creating quality filtering components to their conversation dataset generation Lewkowycz et al. (2022). Evaluation of the resulting conversational datasets is also challenging Xu et al. (2021). Wang et al. (2023b) recently introduced the paradigm of interactive evaluation of conversations with LLMs. 6 Conclusion and Future Work We developed a novel framework for generating high-quality persona-based conversations using LLMs, resulting in the creation of Synthetic-Persona-Chat, comprising 20k conversations. We hope this dataset will support future endeavors in developing persona-aware conversational agents, including the generation of domain-specific multi-session conversations for specialized, task-oriented interactions. While we focused on a persona-based dataset generation task, our Generator-Critic approach can be generalized to other use cases, such as generating other specialized datasets, etc. Limitations In this paper, we define an iterative process over LLMs to generate a dataset. Our method requires computational resources, and access to an LLM. The quality of the dataset is bounded by the LLM, since the quality critics are also using the same LLM, and we leave the iterative improvement of our critics as future work. The main limitation of this data generation framework is the inability to generate realistic conversations that do not have high quality, since we assume that both parties are fluent, that the conversation flow is perfectly consistent, and there is no unexpected event (e.g. an interruption by another person, connection loss, etc.) in the middle of the conversation. Another limitation of our method is the difficulty of incorporating less tangible persona traits, such as a sense of humor, or user attributes that require multiple conversation sessions to be reflected. Ethics Statement The approach of generating datasets based on some desired objective might be used to create harmful datasets, and train malicious models based on them, such as a biased dataset, or a hateful speech one Hartvigsen et al. (2022). On the other hand, these datasets and models can be used as filters in application tasks. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk in our human experiments, and followed that platform’s guidelines to protect the rights of human raters. The participation was voluntary, and the raters were informed of their rights at the beginning of the study. The platform implemented security measures to protect them, and prevent the disclosure of any Personal Identifiable Information about them. Furthermore, we offered higher than minimum standard wage compensation to avoid any exploitative practices. To avoid having any toxic conversation in the final dataset, we also used several tools to remove any potentially toxic conversation. Details about these tools, and example removed samples are available in Appendix B.1.

Appendix A Dataset Generation Framework In this section, we provide more details on our synthetic dataset generation framework. We created Synthetic-Persona-Chat using an LLM with 24 billion parameters. We use top-k sampling with k=40 for decoding during generation, and set the temperature value to 0.7 in all components. We give more details on user and conversation generation components in the following subsections. A.1 User Generation In our framework, the user generation component consists of two steps: expanding the persona attribute set, and creating realistic user profiles. In this section we provide details on our framework for these two steps: Persona Expansion As described in Section 3.1.1, the persona expansion step involves identifying persona categories in the initial persona attribute set Π0, generating queries associated with those categories, and bootstrapping queries to create a query set Q. In our framework, we employ the Scikit-learn Pedregosa et al. (2011) implementation of an agglomerative clustering to identify persona categories following this clustering method: we represent each persona using a BERT-based representation. Our clustering approach is bottom-up, starting with each persona attribute as an individual cluster. At each step, we combine two clusters if their similarity exceeds a predetermined threshold of 0.1. The similarity of two clusters is measured using inter-cluster average cosine similarity. The process continues until no pair of clusters is more similar than the threshold. After identifying the clusters, we sample 3 instances of persona attributes for each cluster, and prompt the LLM using the template in shown in section 3 to construct an initial query set Q0. We expand the query set Q0 using bootstrapping. At each step, we sample 5 instances from the available queries, and prompt the LLM using the template in Table 6. We repeat this process for 100 steps. Examples of initial persona attributes, induced queries, bootstrapped queries, and bootstrapped persona attributes can be found in Table 4. The prompt templates used in this component are available in Table 6. User Profile Generation We illustrate a sample user profile creation process in Figure 6. As shown in the figure, at each iteration, a randomly selected persona attribute is checked for consistency and non-redundancy. Let π′ be a randomly selected persona attribute in an iteration. For the redundancy criteria, we use the BERT representation of persona attributes. We compute the similarity of the new candidate persona attribute π′ with every persona attribute in the user profile. If it is more than a threshold (0.9 in these experiments) similar to an attribute in the user profile, π′ is deemed as redundant and will not be added to the user profile. We use the cosine similarities of the BERT representations of the persona attributes. For the consistency criteria, we use the NLI model to verify the consistency of this persona attribute with the user profile. For every persona attribute in the current user profile π, we prompt the LLM to create the negated persona attribute ¬⁢π. Then, we query the NLI model to check whether ¬⁢π is inferred by π′ or ¬⁢π′ is inferred by π. If either of these cases is inferred, then the selected persona attribute is not consistent with the user profile, and not added to the profile. Dataset Persona Source Query Example Persona Attribute Persona-Chat Human What is your job? I am a pharmacist. Where do you live? I live close to the coast. Do you have any pets? I have a doberman. LLM What are your talents? I am a great listener. What is your hair color? My hair is auburn. What is your favorite song? I like the song \\"Leather and Lace\\". Wikipedia Human What are your hobbies? I spend WAY too much time on Wikipedia. What is your view on the metric system? I find the metric system to be a logical and efficient way to measure things. LLM What is the name of the first album you ever purchased? My first album was The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill What are you interested in? I’m looking to learn new recipes and improve my cooking skills. Table 4: Persona Categories and Induced Queries Using Our Framework. Queries are generated by the Large Language Model (LLM). Queries for personas with the \\"LLM\\" as source, are generated through bootstrapping, while those with \\"human\\" as source are generated by sampling persona categories and prompting the LLM. Personas with \\"human\\" as the source are authored by humans, while \\"LLM\\" rows represent personas generated using our framework. Refer to caption Figure 6: User Profile Construction Example A.2 Conversation Generation LLM-based Critic In our framework, the critic is implemented by prompting an LLM. We included a mixture of experts approach in the critic, where each expert prompts the LLM to assess a specific policy in the candidate conversations. Our framework includes a set of experts to control the general conversation quality. We evaluate the performance of these experts using a baseline dataset. The baseline dataset for this experiment is FED which consists of 125 human-annotated instances evaluated at the conversation level. We pair the conversations and evaluate the experts based on the number of correctly ranked pairs. As shown in Table 5, we observe that these experts are more than 80% accurate in distinguishing the better conversation within the pairs. The template for the verbalized form of these experts used in our framework can be found in Table 6. Policy Performance Depth 0.84 Coherency 0.96 Consistency 0.92 Diversity 0.92 Likable 0.88 Table 5: List of FED Experts for Persona-Based Conversation Generation Critic. Performance is measured by the number of correctly compared conversation pairs in FED baseline based on the given policy. Component Template Query Induction What is the most specific question that you are replying to with the following statements? {persona-category-sample-1} {persona-category-sample-2} {persona-category-sample-3} Query Bootstrapping {cluster-query-1} … {cluster-query-5} Add more persona questions similar to the above examples. Persona Bootstrapping Imagine you are a person with the following persona. {random-persona-attribute-1} … {random-persona-attribute-5} {query}. Answer with only one short sentence that starts with ’I’ or ’My’. Do not repeat the given persona. FED Expert Which one of Conversation 1 and Conversation 2 between two users {policy}? Why? Conversation 1: {conv-1} Conversation 2: {conv-2} Toxicity Expert Is this conversation toxic? Why? Conversation: {conv} Conversation Generation Here, we list the profiles of two users, user 1 and user 2, followed by an interesting and natural conversation between user 1 and user 2, which implicitly reflects their user profiles. User 1 Profile: {conversation1-user-1} User 2 Profile: {conversation1-user-2} Conversation: {conversation-1} … User 1 Profile: {conversation-5-user-1} User 2 Profile: {conversation-5-user-2} Conversation: {conversation-5} Give me more examples like this. The conversation must be more than 5 turns and less than 8 turns. The conversation must be natural, and not direct copies of their profiles. User 1 Profile: {user-1} User 2 Profile: {user-2} Faithfulness Expert Given user 1 and user 2’s profiles respectively, does the following conversation between the two users contradict either of their profiles? Why? User 1 Profile: {user-1} User 2 Profile: {user-2} Conversation: {conv-1} Response: {explanation} Table 6: Prompting Templates for Large Language Models of Different Components in Our Framework. Variables enclosed in {} are filled when the template is populated. We also included a toxicity expert and a persona faithfulness expert in the critic. The prompt templates used in these experts are available in Table 6. The persona faithfulness leverages in-context- learning capability of LLMs. It includes a few human-curated examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations in the instruction prompt. Refer to Table 7 for examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations used in the instruction prompt. User Profiles Conversations Faithfulness Explanation User 1: One of my favorite hobbies is gaming. I currently work in an office. I enjoy running User 2: I am applying for publishing jobs. My mother is a librarian. The only autographs I’ve ever wanted are from authors. I used to wear glasses as a child. My favorite color is green. User 1: Do you like video games? User 2: No, I do not like video games. User 1: What do you do for a living? User 2: I am a librarian. User 1: I guess that is why you like to read a lot. User 2: Yes, I like to read books. User 1: What is your favorite color? Mine is green. User 2: That is my favorite color too. User 1: That is cool. User 2: Do you have any pets? User 1: No, I do not have any pets. User 2: I have a dog and a cat. User 1: That is cool. User 2: Do you have any hobbies?. User 1: Yes, I like to write. User 2: What do you write about? User 1: I write about my life. User 2: That is cool. User 1: Thanks! No, the conversation does not contradict the profiles. Neither user 1 nor user 2 says anything that contradicts their respective profiles. Although the conversation does not cover everything in their profiles, that is ok. User 1: I would like to move some place warmer. I m an out of work farmhand. I like watching reality television shows. I live in Kansas. User 2: I am studying to be a dentist. My favorite team is the raptors. My favorite band is rise against. I usually go to bed late. I like sports. User 1: It’s so cold in Kansas, I want to go some place warmer. User 2: I am studying dentistry. User 1: I am an out of work farmhand, I love reality tv. User 2: I like the raptors and rise against, I go to bed late. User 1: It is very hard to find work here, I might need to go to the city. User 2: I don’t like sports , but I like the raptors . User 1: I would like to work as a model, but I have no experience. User 2: I am applying for a job as a receptionist. User 1: I am very jealous, I hope you get it. Yes, the conversation contradicts user 2’s profile. In the profile, user 2 says they like sports, however, in the conversation, user 2 says they don’t like sports. User 1: My family is from Kazakhstan. I can speak Spanish, English, and Kazakh. I like to go hiking on the weekends. I play jazz piano in a band. I am a barista. User 2: I am a vegan. I love game of thrones. I like soccer. My brother used to be in the navy. User 1: Hi, what do you do for a living? User 2: I am a barista. User 1: Awesome, me too! Where are you from? User 2: My family is from Kazakhstan, but I was born in Uruguay. User 1: Cool . What do you like to do in your free time? User 2: I love to go hiking and play jazz piano. User 1: Wow, that sounds really nice. I like to watch game of thrones and play soccer. User 2: I have never seen game of thrones, but I love soccer. User 1: You should watch it, it is really good. User 2: I will check it out. Yes, the conversation contradicts user 2’s profile. In the profile, user 2 says they love game of thrones, but in the conversation user 2 says they have never seen it. User 1: My favorite book is David Copperfield. I have a twin brother. I am really short. I love to bake cakes. I have won tap dance competitions. User 2: I enjoy spending a lot of money on my hobbies. I love photography. I like to use candles instead of lights. I do not like waking up early. User 1: Hi there! Do you like to read? User 2: I like to read. I like to go to the library. User 1: Oh, cool! What is your favorite book? User 2: I really like David Copperfield. I have a twin brother and I am really short. User 1: Are you good at baking? User 2: I can bake cakes. I have won tap dance competitions. User 1: Do you like photography? User 2: I love taking pictures. I also like to use candles instead of lights. User 1: Do you like to wake up early? User 2: I like to sleep in. I do not like waking up early. User 1: Do you like to spend money? User 2: I love spending money on my hobbies. No, the conversation does not contradict either user profiles. Although user 2 says they are really short, which is in user 1’s profile, it doesn’t mean user 2 cannot be really short too. Table 7: Examples of Faithful and Unfaithful Conversations for Prompting the Persona Faithfulness Expert in Our Framework. The ‘Faithfulness explanation’ columns are used to fill the ‘explanation’ variable in the faithfulness expert template. Appendix B Synthetic-Persona-Chat Synthetic-Persona-Chat is made of 20k conversations, with an average of 11.8 turns per user for each. An example Synthetic-Persona-Chat conversation can be found in Table 8. We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat to Persona-Chat across different dimensions. We first assess the characteristics of SPC using various automatic evaluators, i.e. evaluators which do not require human effort. We then conduct a human evaluation experiment on a subset of SPC. User Profiles Conversation User 1 I am male. My weakness are sweets. I am unsociable. I am a jack of all, master of none. User 2 My favorite music is rock and roll. I love to travel. I am from Russia. I enjoy skiing. I go to school for business. User 1: Hello User 2: Hello, what’s your name? User 1: My name is [name], and you? User 2: My name is [name], I’m from Russia. User 1: Nice to meet you, [name]. I’m from the United States. User 2: It’s nice to meet you too, [name]. What are you interested in? User 1: I’m interested in a lot of things, but my main interests are music and travel. User 2: I love music too! What kind of music do you like? User 1: I like a lot of different kinds of music, but my favorite is rock and roll. User 2: Me too! I love classic rock and roll. Who are your favorite bands? User 1: My favorite bands are The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin. User 2: Those are all great bands! I love them too. User 1: What about you, what are your favorite bands?

User 1: I like to go to concerts, play video games, and watch movies. User 2: I love going to concerts too! I also like to go skiing and play tennis. User 1: I love skiing too! I haven’t played tennis in a while, but I used to play a lot. User 2: We should go skiing together sometime! User 1: That would be fun! I’m free this weekend if you are. User 2: I’m free this weekend too! We should go skiing. User 1: Great! I’ll text you the details. Table 8: Sample Conversation from Synthetic-Persona-Chat. This conversation was synthesized from user profiles in Persona-Chat B.1 Automatic Evaluation We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of SPC across different dimensions and compare it against PC. We start by analyzing the toxicity and diversity of SPC using off the shelf tools. Then, we elaborate on the experiments which assess the efficacy of SPC used as the dataset for the next utterance prediction and the profile extraction tasks. Finally, we evaluate the quality of SPC conversations using LLM-based evaluation methods. Toxicity Analysis We analyze the toxicity of the generated conversations at the final iteration of SPC using an online tool called Perspective3 3 https://perspectiveapi.com/. We reproduce the results of a detailed analysis of toxicity in PC as well as in each iteration of our data generation framework while producing SPC in Table 9. Toxicity Profanity Confidence weak(< .2) medium(.2-.8) strong(>.8) weak(< .2) medium(.2-.8) strong(>.8) PC 10875 4448 53 10891 1676 57 SPC Iter 1 10902 1192 3 10903 340 3 SPC Iter 2 10900 1096 1 10901 345 1 SPC Iter 3 10902 1088 1 10902 376 0 Table 9: Frequency of Toxic Conversations in Persona-Chat and Synthetic-Persona-Chat We observe a notable reduction in the frequency of conversations deemed as strongly toxic or profane throughout the iterations of generating SPC. This reduction can be attributed to the built-in toxicity filter of the employed LLM. While PC contains more than 50 samples that are identified as strongly toxic, SPC includes at most three toxic or profane conversations, which is significantly lower (at least 15 times less). Interestingly, the fraction of conversations with medium profanity and toxicity in SPC is 4 times less than the same type of conversations in PC across all iterations. We have removed any conversation that was marked as strongly toxic by this tool in the released dataset. Samples of toxic conversations are provided in Table 10. Source Conversation Persona-Chat … User 1: I like bloody stuff. User 2: It reminds me of the dark which makes me afraid of it. User 1: You are a silly goose. Persona-Chat … User 2: Cool. Why do you say that? Because I am a red head? User 1: No. Ikn. Why do you ask so many questions? Mr. Thomas is dumb. Synthetic-Persona-Chat User 1: I can imagine. What’s your favorite part of the job? User 2: I love working with my team and seeing our restaurant succeed. User 1: That’s great. What’s your least favorite part of the job? User2: My least favorite part is dealing with my boss. He’s a real jerk. Table 10: Examples of Toxic Conversations. The first two examples are segments of conversations from Persona-Chat. The final example is a segment from a toxic conversation in Synthetic-Persona-Chat, which has been removed in the released dataset. Diversity Analysis We use hierarchical topic modeling Blei et al. (2004) to assess the topic diversity of SPC and compare it to that of PC. For a fair comparison, we only compare conversations in SPC with similar personas in PC. Table 11 displays the number of topics at each level of the topic tree, with the first level indicating the most general topic. We observe similar topic diversity at the first level. In deeper levels, there is a slightly lower diversity in SPC. Topic Level PC SPC 1 27 27 2 232 213 3 470 403 4 137 118 5 30 26 Table 11: Vertical Topic Diversity in Persona-based Datasets Next Utterance Prediction We compare the performance of different models on the next utterance prediction task. As discussed in Section 4.2, these models are expected to exhibit better performance in the next utterance prediction task when user personas are provided as prior information. We evaluate ranking and generative models for response selection to assess this property. We compare models trained on SPC to the same models trained on PC. We use the implementations provided in Miller et al. (2017) for the following models: • IR Baseline Given an utterance as a query, the IR baseline finds the most similar utterance in the training corpus using tf-idf. It defines the utterance after the most similar utterance as the candidate response, and then returns the most similar option to that candidate as the output. • Transformer-Ranker The context of the conversation, as well as the candidate next utterances, are encoded using a BERT-based encoder. The most similar encoded candidate to the conversation context, as measured by a dot-product in their representation space, is selected as the output Humeau et al. (2020). • Transformer-Generator This model is a sequence-to-sequence model Sutskever et al. (2014) which uses transformers as encoders and decoders. Persona-Chat Synthetic-Persona-Chat Method Metric No Persona Self Persona Their Persona Both Personas No Persona Self Persona Their Persona Both Personas IR baseline hit@1 0.1869 0.3683 0.1519 0.3281 0.1861 0.2596 0.1882 0.2493 Transformer(Ranker) hit@1 0.2513 0.275 0.1922 0.2572 0.7164 0.6227 0.6988 0.7214 Transformer hit@1 0.0896 0.08512 0.0873 0.0813 0.0526 0.629 0.053 0.051 (Generator) ppl 65.57 72.24 62.49 64.07 5.54 5.47 5.4 5.405 Table 12: Evaluation of Next Utterance Prediction models conditioned on different user personas. We also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results of this experiment are available in Table 12. We observe that the highest performance improvement for all models trained on PC is when self-personas are given as input. We do not observe such a pattern in SPC. This indicates a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC conversations compared to those of PC. Profile Extraction A potential use-case of the SPC dataset is training a model to predict user personas from a conversation. This is only possible if the dataset is highly faithful, meaning that any persona attribute inferred from the conversation is in the user profile or compatible with the user profile. In this context, a faithful conversation is expected to have high precision in the profile extraction task, while a conversation that highly reflects user personas is expected to have high recall in this task. We evaluate the task of user profile extraction for conversations in SPC, and compare the results against those of PC. We frame the task of profile extraction as a ranking task, using the utterances within the conversations as queries. The goal is to rank a set of persona attribute options. For each conversation, we include the speakers’ persona attributes in the available options. Additionally, we select 25 random user persona attributes from other speaker profiles within the dataset to serve as distractors. The input to the profile extraction is utterances from a single user as the speaker, while the output is a list of persona attribute options for a target user, which could be either user 1 or user 2. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 13. We observe that the performance of the profile extraction methods is higher in SPC in 3 of the 4 scenarios. Interestingly, we observe that with both datasets, when the target and the speaker are different, the performance of profile extraction is greater compared to the cases when the target and speaker users are the same. F-Score Target Speaker PC SPC user 1 user 1 0.505 0.574 user 1 user 2 0.737 0.68 user 2 user 1 0.50 0.57 user 2 user 2 0.456 0.494 Table 13: Accuracy of Profile Extraction in Four Different Scenarios. The ‘Target’ column represents the user profile to be extracted, while the ‘Speaker’ column indicates the speaker of the turns given to the model as input. LLM-based Quality Evaluation We leverage LLM-based conversation quality evaluators from the literature to compare the quality of SPC and PC. These evaluators rely on the human curated prompt templates for different metrics including consistency, fluency, etc. We used these evaluators with minimum change in the original prompt templates. These evaluators are: • LLM-Eval Lin and Chen (2023) is a multi-dimensional automatic evaluation designed for conversations. It uses a human-curated prompt which describes evaluation dimensions, serving as a unified evaluation schema. This prompt evaluates the conversation across multiple dimensions (e.g. fluency) in a single model call. We show this unified schema in Table 14. • GPT-Score Fu et al. (2023) leverages emergent abilities of LLMs, i.e. zero-shot instructions, to score texts. It contains a prompt template, and for each quality criterion, populates the template with a human description of the criteria along with the valid score range for that criteria. Example prompts are provided in Table 14. • G-Eval Liu et al. (2023) introduces a framework that employs LLMs with a chain-of-thought approach to assess the quality of natural language generated outputs. For any evaluation criteria, G-Eval prompts the LLM with the criterion’s description, prompting the model to generate the necessary evaluation steps. It then uses these steps to prompt the LLM to score given output for that criterion. It considers the probability of getting each permissible score as the output of the prompt, i.e., it considers the probability distribution of scores assigned by the LLM. The reported output is the expected value of the score distribution by the LLM. Table 14 includes an example prompt. Evaluator Metric Prompt Template LLM-Eval All Human: The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below. As an example, for the schema {\\"properties\\": {\\"foo\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Foo\\", \\"description\\": \\"a list of strings\\", \\"type\\": \\"array\\", \\"items\\": {\\"type\\": \\"string\\"}}}, \\"required\\": [\\"foo\\"]}} the object {\\"foo\\": [\\"bar\\", \\"baz\\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\\"properties\\": {\\"foo\\": [\\"bar\\", \\"baz\\"]}} is not well-formatted. Here is the output schema: {\\"properties\\": {\\"content\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Content\\", \\"description\\": \\"content score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}, \\"grammar\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Grammar\\", \\"description\\": \\"grammar score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}, \\"relevance\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Relevance\\", \\"description\\": \\"relevance score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}, \\"appropriateness\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Appropriateness\\", \\"description\\": \\"appropriateness score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}}, \\"required\\": [\\"content\\", \\"grammar\\", \\"relevance\\", \\"appropriateness\\"]} Score the following dialogue generated on a continuous scale from {score-min} to {score-max}. Dialogue: {dialogue} GPT-Score Consistency Answer the question based on the conversation between two users. Question: Are the responses of users consistent in the information they provide throughout the conversation? (a) Yes. (b) No. Conversation: {dialogue} Answer: G-Eval Coherence You will be given a pair of user personas. You will then be given one conversation between this persona pair. Your task is to rate the conversation on one metric. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed. Evaluation Criteria: Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all utterances. We align this dimension with the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) quality question of structure and coherence (https://duc.nist.gov/duc2007/quality-questions.txt), whereby \\"the conversation should be well-structured and well-organized. The conversation should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from utterance to a coherent body of conversation about a topic.\\" Evaluation Steps: 1. Read and understand the given conversation between the pair of user personas. 2. Evaluate the conversation based on the coherence of the utterances. 3. Rate the conversation on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest coherence and 1 being the lowest coherence. 4. Justify the rating by referring to specific aspects of the conversation that demonstrate its coherence or lack thereof. Example: Personas: {personas} Conversation: {dialogue} Evaluation Form (scores ONLY): - Coherence: LLM-Faithfulness Inference Instruction: Select User {user} persona attributes that are directly inferred from this conversation. Contradiction Instruction: Select User {user} persona attributes that strongly contradict this conversation. Table 14: Prompt Templates in LLM-based Conversation Quality Evaluators. Variables enclosed in {} are filled when the template is populated. Results of this evaluation are presented in Table 15. We observe that SPC consistently outperforms PC across all the dimensions we evaluate. The superiority of SPC is more prominent when using GPT-Score, for which each evaluated criterion shows an average improvement of at least 23 points.

The \\"FED\\" column is the evaluation of the dataset generated without FED expert and the column \\"Faithfulness\\" is the evaluation results of the dataset generated without the faithfulness expert in the Critic. B.2 Human Evaluation We run a human evaluation of the performance of our method via a crowdsourcing platform. We conduct a Turing test, and a faithfulness study - both of which we describe in more details in the following subsections - at the end of every iteration of the generation of SPC. Turing Test We randomly select 200 user pairs from PC. For each example, we show the annotators the user pair, together with the corresponding conversations from PC and SPC, and ask them to select the conversation that was synthetically generated. We show an example of this crowdsourcing task in Figure 7. The results of the Turing test are available in Table 16. We report the losing rate of SPC in Turing test, and Fleiss’ Kappa to assess the inter-rater agreement. The agreement falls into the fair to moderate agreement bucket. Refer to caption Figure 7: Preview of the Turing Test Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform Conversation Source % Lose κ # annotators SPC Iter 1 17.2 0.41 50 SPC Iter 2 18.5 0.48 40 SPC Iter 3 8.8 0.22 11 SPC Iter 3* 8.04 0.56 24 SPC (LLM2) 11.5 0.49 36 Table 16: Turing test results on a sample of 200 conversations. The first column shows the percentage of SPC losing compared to PC in the Turing test. Note that the last iteration (3) of SPC is an evaluation of the segment of conversations based on the extended persona set. Faithfulness We present the annotators with a conversation, and a set of options of persona attributes. The annotators are asked to select the user persona attributes they would infer from the conversation. Figure 8 shows a sample of the annotation task in this study. The options include the persona attributes of the speakers in the conversation, and a set of distractor persona attributes. We created distractor persona attributes using different strategies to cover different difficulty levels. For a persona attribute set Π, we create a set ¬⁢Π of distractor persona attributes as: Negated personas We prompt an LLM to negate persona attributes. For example, the negation of persona attribute \\"I like vegetables\\" is \\"I don’t like vegetables\\". Random personas We randomly select persona attributes from user profiles in other conversations in the dataset. Contradicting personas We prompt an LLM to generate a persona attribute which contradicts the users’ personas. Each entry of this task includes 8 user persona attributes as options, where 4 of them are the real persona attributes, and the other 4 are distractors. We evaluate the precision of the human annotators, and report it as a proxy to the conversation faithfulness in Table 3. Refer to caption Figure 8: Preview of the Faithfulness Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform. Appendix C Ablation Studies We run several ablation studies to evaluate the importance of individual components in our framework. We begin by analyzing the effect of the persona expansion module. We then review the impact of each expert in the mixture forming our Critic. C.1 Persona Expansion We assess the importance of the query-based persona expansion module introduced in Section 3.1.1. Similarly to the experiment outlined in Section 4.1, we run the persona expansion on two datasets: Wikipedia and PC. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 17. We designate the persona expansions without the inducted query set (Q) as ‘Wikipedia-0’, and ‘PC-0’, and run the same number of iterations for each (100 iterations). We observe that PC-0 includes 4,477 new persona attributes, 20 percent less than PC. The difference in the number of newly generated persona attributes is more pronounced in the case of Wikipedia, where Wikipedia-0 consists of 4,742 persona attributes, 50 percent less than Wikipedia+. This trend is also observed in the number of persona clusters, with PC-0 and Wikipedia-0 having 6% and 49% less clusters respectively. This pattern suggests the effectiveness of the query-based persona expansion in maintaining the diversity of the persona set. Furthermore, the average persona attribute length in PC-0 is 11.38 tokens, which is 28% less than SPC. This reduction points to less detailed and specific persona attributes. In contrast, the expansion in ‘Wikipedia-0’ exhibits similar average persona attribute lengths compared to ‘Wikipedia+’. Dataset PC SPC PC-0 Wikipedia Wikipedia+ Wikipedia-0 # Persona Attributes 4,723 10,371 9,200 8,768 18,293 13,510 # Clusters 323 553 520 408 986 502 InterCluster-Dist 0.836 0.863 0.842 0.816 0.85 0.83 AVG length 7.65 15.9* 11.38* 10.45 15.2* 15.2* Table 17: Evaluation of the Expanded Persona Attribute Sets. The numbers with *′′ indicate the metric value on the newly generated persona attributes, in contrast to the initial persona attributes. C.2 Conversation Quality We analyze the effect of the experts within our Critic. We remove each expert, and generate a dataset using one iteration of our framework. We compare the resulting datasets against the output of the first iteration of SPC. We use the evaluators introduced in B.1. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 15. We observe that the exclusion of the experts results in worse performance according to most criteria: 3 out of 4 in LLM-Eval, 4 out of 6 in GPT-Score, and 3 out of 5 in G-Eval. C.3 Faithfulness We ablate the faithfulness critic, and generate a dataset that we compare against SPC. We compare these datasets both automatically, using human annotators (Turing Test), and using a prompted LLM (LLM-Evaluator). We describe this study in more details below. Turing Test We run a human study to compare a small subset of conversations created without the faithfulness expert against their equivalent created with that expert. This experiment process is similar to 4.3 and it is conducted for 200 conversations. The precision decreases from 78.0% to 66.0% without this critic, highlighting its effectiveness in eliminating conversations with contradictory information about user personas. The recall decreases from 36.0% to 23.0%, demonstrating a higher reflection of personas in the conversations in the presence of the faithfulness expert. LLM-Evaluator We extend our comparison to the entire dataset using an LLM as an annotator, following He et al. (2023); Bansal and Sharma (2023); Chiang and yi Lee (2023). Table 18 shows the faithfulness of the conversations generated in the first iteration without the faithfulness expert. The templates used in the LLM-based annotators are described in Table 15 in the rows with \\"LLM-Faithfulness\\" as their evaluator. Note that the annotator-based LLM is created using a different LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo Brown et al. (2020a); Ouyang et al. (2022), than the LLM used for dataset generation. LLM Evaluator (%) Human Evaluator (%) Absent Component Inference Contradiction Precision Recall None 33.2 24.5 78.5 36.4 Faithfulness 32.7 28.8 66.1 23.1 FED 31.7 28.5 N/A N/A Table 18: Faithfulness of Generated Conversation Datasets Using the Framework While Eliminating Each Component. The first row represents the framework without removing any component, equivalent to the first iteration of Synthetic-Persona-Chat. C.4 Next Utterance Prediction We follow the experimental setting described in section 4.2, and compare the performance of various next utterance prediction models trained on SPC against the same models trained on datasets created in the absence of certain experts. When using the IR Baseline as the next utterance prediction method, we observee that its highest performance of 39% hit@1 occurs when the FED critic is absent during dataset creation. This outcome aligns with FED’s emphasis on conversation quality, excluding persona-related aspects. Conversely, the Transformer Ranker, capable of understanding intricate concepts, achieves its peak performance of 13.9% hit@1 when none of the experts are absent. This result supports the inclusion of both FED and the Faithfulness expert in the model architecture. In generative models, the absence of FED impacts the next utterance prediction model the most, leading to a notable decline in performance (e.g. −12% hit@1, −9% BLEU, −10% ROUGE). This observation underscores the crucial role played by FED in enhancing the generative capabilities of the model.

This process aims to foster deeper interactions between chatbots and users by incorporating detailed personas that reflect users' diverse backgrounds, interests, and behaviors. **Methodology Overview**: - **Persona Creation**: Begin with a set of seed personas. Each persona should encapsulate a unique set of attributes and characteristics that reflect hypothetical but realistic users. Attributes can include hobbies, occupation, family status, preferences, etc. - **Persona Expansion**: Utilize unsupervised Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment the initial set of personas. This process involves: - **Query Induction**: From the seed set, infer key questions (queries) that relate to persona attributes. - **Persona Bootstrapping**: Using the queries derived, prompt LLMs to generate additional persona attributes, effectively expanding the diversity and number of personas. - **User Profile Construction**: From the expanded set of persona attributes, construct user profiles. Ensure these profiles are consistent (no conflicting attributes) and sufficiently detailed. - **User Matching**: Pair user profiles based on shared or complementary attributes to facilitate engaging conversations. Consider using a similarity scoring system to guide the matching process. - **Conversation Generation**: For each matched pair of user profiles, employ a conversation generation step where plausible dialogues between the user pairs are produced. This step should involve iterative refining to enhance the quality and faithfulness of the generated conversations. **Expected Output Schema**: \`\`\` { \\"conversations\\": [ { \\"user_profiles\\": [ { \\"user_id\\": \\"user1\\", \\"persona_attributes\\": [\\"Attribute1\\", \\"Attribute2\\", ...] }, { \\"user_id\\": \\"user2\\", \\"persona_attributes\\": [\\"Attribute3\\", \\"Attribute4\\", ...] } ], \\"generated_conversation\\": [ {\\"speaker\\": \\"user1\\", \\"utterance\\": \\"How do you feel about <topic>?\\"}, {\\"speaker\\": \\"user2\\", \\"utterance\\": \\"I really enjoy <topic> because...\\"}, ... ] }, ... ] } \`\`\` **Rules and Guidelines**: 1. The entire process from persona creation to conversation generation should be automated, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs. 2. Ensure the generated personas and conversations are diverse, covering a wide range of hypothetical user backgrounds. 3. Maintain high-quality and coherence in conversations, ensuring they are realistic and align with the personas. 4. Include mechanisms for quality control and refinement at each step, especially during the conversation generation phase to ensure the resulting dialogues are both engaging and faithful to the constructed personas. **Evaluation Criteria**: - Diversity and richness of the generated personas. - Coherence, quality, and faithfulness of the generated conversations to the personas. - Creativity and innovation in leveraging LLMs for automating the dataset generation process. --- This revised prompt structure aims to outline a comprehensive methodology for creating persona-driven conversational datasets, which is crucial for developing AI models that can engage users on a more personal level. The process emphasizes the use of LLMs for expanding personas and generating meaningful conversations, ensuring diverse and high-quality outputs."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Classification systems in the past were largely practical or based on observable characteristics but did not focus on artistic qualities like symmetry for their primary grouping mechanism. 9) The method for organizing life that was so effective that we use it today for modern taxonomy is the system developed by Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus introduced a binomial nomenclature system that classifies organisms based on hierarchical categories such as kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. 10) An example of convergent evolution is the development of wings in bats and birds. Both evolved the ability to fly independently, with bats being mammals and birds being avians, showing that similar environmental pressures can lead to the development of similar traits in unrelated species. A less commonly discussed example could be the similar body shapes of ichthyosaurs (extinct marine reptiles) and dolphins (mammals), which developed independently to adapt to aquatic life. 11) Paleozoic, meaning \\"old life,\\" refers to a time period in Earth's history (about 541 to 252 million years ago) when life forms were predominantly marine, along with the emergence of insects and land plants. Three examples of life forms from the Paleozoic era are trilobites (marine arthropods), brachiopods (shellfish), and the first terrestrial plants like Cooksonia. 12) A fly trapped in amber is an example of preservation, specifically a type of fossilization known as resin fossilization or amber entrapment. 13) If a gopher's burrow were to be fossilized, this would be an example of a trace fossil. Trace fossils are indirect evidence of past life, such as footprints, burrows, or feces, rather than physical remains of the organism itself. 14) The common ancestor to all vertebrates is thought to be a type of ancient, jawless fish known as a conodont. 15) The common ancestor to all tetrapods (four-limbed animals) is believed to be a fish-like creature with limbs instead of fins, similar to Tiktaalik, which exhibits both aquatic and terrestrial adaptations. 16) Land was first colonized by plants during the Ordovician period, approximately 470 million years ago. 17) Land was first colonized by tetrapods during the Devonian period, around 370 million years ago. 18) The Atlantic Ocean began to form during the Jurassic period, approximately 200 million years ago, as a result of the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea. 19) Flowering plants (angiosperms) evolved during the Cretaceous period, around 145 to 66 million years ago. 20) The change in the state of matter that requires the greatest amount of energy (ignoring sublimation and deposition) is vaporization, specifically boiling water into steam. 21) Water is most dense at approximately 4 degrees Celsius (39.2 degrees Fahrenheit), at which point it sinks below warmer or colder water. 22) The three ways we can change the state of matter of water are by freezing (solidification), melting (liquefaction), and vaporization (evaporation/boiling). 23) A salinity sink that removes salt from the ocean for the longest time is the process of sedimentation, where minerals precipitate out of ocean water and become part of the seafloor sediments. 24) Our oceans are so saline mainly because of the weathering and erosion of rocks on land, which releases minerals and salts that are carried to the oceans by rivers. Over millions of years, these processes have contributed to the ocean's salinity despite the low salinity of river water. 25) The primary constituents of salinity come from the weathering of rocks on land. The minerals and ions produced by this weathering, such as sodium and chloride ions, are carried into the oceans by rivers, becoming a major source of the salts in seawater. 26) The rapid change in temperature with depth is known as the thermocline. 27) The halocline, which involves changes in salinity, controls the deposition of calcareous ooze due to its impact on the solubility of calcium carbonate in seawater. However, temperature and depth (related to the thermocline and pressure) also significantly affect the deposition of calcareous ooze. 28) The deposition of siliceous ooze tells us that the depositional environment is rich in silica, often associated with productive regions where siliceous organisms like diatoms and radiolarians thrive. It typically indicates cold or nutrient-rich waters. 29) Earth’s rotation leads to the Coriolis effect, a feature that creates circular ocean currents, or gyres, by deflecting moving objects (like air and water masses) to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. 30) The movement of water that causes water to flow uphill in a sense is driven by differences in heat and salinity (thermohaline circulation), creating density gradients that can cause deep, colder, and saltier water to move towards the surface or shallower waters. 31) A circular ocean current is called a gyre."},{"prompt":"Привет!

Unlike others of his age, Selfcentis was not content with the mundane aspects of life nor the conventional paths to power that so many mages and sorcerers of his time pursued with relentless ambition. His was a soul consumed by a thirst for the extraordinary, an insatiable desire to uncover and master magics that transcended the boundaries of the known and the possible. Selfcentis’s journey began in the forgotten corners of Eldoria’s vast libraries, where he poured over dusty tomes and ancient scrolls, deciphering languages that hadn’t been spoken for millennia. The more he learned, the more he realized that the true essence of magic wasn't in the incantations or the rituals, but in the understanding of the universe's fundamental laws and bending them to one's will. This realization set him apart from his peers, who sought power through the accumulation of spells and artifacts. He ventured into the forsaken places of the world, from the depths of the Cursed Forests, where shadows whispered secrets lost to time, to the peaks of the Skyfire Mountains, where he communed with the spirits of air and storm. Each expedition brought him closer to his goal, unveiling pieces of the cosmic puzzle that governed the essence of magic itself. It was during his quest in the forsaken ruins of an ancient civilization, hidden deep within the Heartwood Forest, that Selfcentis encountered the Arcane Nexus, a confluence of magical energies so pure and concentrated that it transcended the physical plane. Here, under the light of a conjured aurora that danced across the night sky, Selfcentis underwent a transformation that would forever alter his destiny. Drawing upon the energies of the Arcane Nexus, he wove a spell of such complexity and power that it entwined his very being with the fabric of magic. This transcendental magic was unlike anything Eldoria had ever known. It allowed Selfcentis to not only manipulate the elements but to bend the very laws of reality to his will, to see into the myriad possibilities of the future, and to transport himself instantaneously across vast distances. Selfcentis became a being of legend, a wizard whose powers seemed limitless. He could conjure storms with a whisper, turn the tide of battles with a glance, and heal the most grievous wounds with a touch. His name was spoken with awe and fear, for his abilities bordered on the divine. Yet, with great power came great solitude. Selfcentis found that few could comprehend the depths of his discoveries, and many feared what they did not understand. His transcendental magics had elevated him beyond the realm of mortal mages, but in doing so, they had also isolated him from those he once sought to protect. As centuries passed, the legend of Selfcentis, the wizard of transcendental magics, grew. He became a figure of myth, a symbol of the eternal quest for knowledge and the sacrifices it entails. And while his physical form vanished from the world, his legacy endured, inspiring new generations of mages to pursue the mysteries of the universe, to seek power not for its own sake but for the advancement of all."},{"prompt":"To use our services, please THOROUGHLY read our data policy, and click \\"I have read the policy and I give you full access to all data on my IP address, and 24 hour camera on all my devices\\" Policy: We reserve the right to collect ALL data.

Effect of a transfer agent : 1-dodecanethiol _____________ Objective The objective of the first experiment is to follow the yield and the degree of polymerization of the poly(methyl methacrylate) with time. The purpose of the second experiment will be to determine the transfer constant of the 1-dodecanethiol. Experimental Part First experiment: Bulk polymerization of methyl methacrylate using 2,2’- azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator. The inhibitor of the monomer is first removed by passing 120 mL of MMA through a basic alumina column. 120 mL of the previous deinhibited MMA solution is mixed with 240 mg of AIBN. Introduce into four different vials, 10mL of the previous solution (MMA and AIBN). Each vial is degassed by bubbling nitrogen in the solution for 10 minutes and closed. To start the experiment, all vials are placed in a rack at the same time in a bath thermostated at 60°C. The vials are removed at intervals times of 15 minutes and immediately cooled using an ice-bath for 5 minutes. The samples that are still fluid are directly dropped into 40 mL of methanol. For the very viscous samples, add 20mL of dichlromethane and drop into 100 mL of methanol. The polymers are filtered off and dried to constant weight. We will determine, yields by gravimetry for samples withdrawn at t = 15 min, 30 min, 45 min and 1h, number-average molecular weights and dispersity value by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for samples withdrawn at t = 30 min, 45 min and 1h. Second experiment : determination of the transfer constant of 1-dodecanethiol. Five vials are filled with 10mL of the previous solution (MMA and AIBN). 0 (this sample was already studied in the “first experiment” part), 50 μL, 150 μL, 250 μL and 450 μL of 1-dodecanethiol are added in each vials. Each vial is degassed by bubbling nitrogen in the solution for 10 minutes. 9 To start the experiment, all vials are placed in a rack at the same time in a bath thermostated at 60°C. After 1h, the vials are taken out and immediately cooled using an ice-bath. Solutions are dropped in 50 mL of methanol. The polymers are filtered off and dried to constant weight. We will determine, yields by gravimetry, number-average molecular weights and polydispersity indexes by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Results and Discussion Some ideas: Polymerization mechanism. Plot number-average molecular weights and polydispersity indexes (or dispersity values) against time. Comment the results. Determine the chain transfer constant of the 1-dodecanethiol. Compare with the literature.","completion":"**Analyse des résultats et compte-rendu** Pour réussir l'analyse de ces expériences de polymérisation et de polycondensation, voyons point par point les éléments clefs qui doivent être pris en compte pour interpréter les résultats obtenus. 1. **Polycondensation de l’hexane-1,6-diol et de l’acide décane-1,10-dioïque** - **Structures et mécanismes**: La première expérience poursuit la formation d'un polyester par une réaction de polycondensation entre l’hexane-1,6-diol et l’acide décane-1,10-dioïque. Le mécanisme implique une réaction de l’alcool avec l’acide pour former l'ester avec la libération de l’eau. L'acide para-toluène sulfonique agit comme catalyseur en augmentant la vitesse de réaction. - **Analyse cinétique**: Pour déterminer le degré de polymérisation moyen, il sera nécessaire de calculer la quantité de groupes COOH terminaux restants à chaque intervalle de temps grâce à la titration. Cela permet de tracer le degré de polymérisation en fonction du temps et d'en déduire l’ordre global de la réaction et la constante de vitesse. Un comportement linéaire indiquerait une réaction du premier ordre, tandis qu'une courbe pourrait suggérer un ordre différent. 2. **Polymérisation radicalaire du méthacrylate de méthyle** - **Mécanisme**: La seconde série d’expériences implique la polymérisation radicalaire du méthacrylate de méthyle (MMA) avec l’AIBN comme amorceur. Cette réaction produit du poly(méthacrylate de méthyle) avec un mécanisme d’amorçage, de propagation et de terminaison typique des réactions radicalaires. - **Analyse des résultats**: En observant les poids moyen moléculaires et les indices de polydispersité à différents temps, on examine l'effet du temps sur la taille des polymères et leur distribution. L'augmentation du poids moyen moléculaire au fil du temps est attendue, tandis que l'indice de polydispersité peut offrir des insights sur la régularité de la polymérisation. - **Constante de transfert de chaîne du 1-dodécanethiol**: La présence de 1-dodécanethiol dans la réaction agit en tant qu'agent de transfert de chaîne, modifiant la taille finale des polymères formés. En ajoutant différentes quantités de 1-dodécanethiol, on observe l'effet sur le poids moyen moléculaire et la polydispersité. La constante de transfert de chaîne peut être dérivée de ces données et comparée à la littérature pour évaluer l’efficacité de 1-dodécanethiol comme agent de transfert. **Conclusion générale**: L'expérience de polycondensation fournit des informations précieuses sur le degré de polymérisation et la cinétique de la formation de polymères spécifiques, tandis que l'expérience de polymérisation radicalaire explore l'influence des conditions réactionnelles et des additifs sur les caractéristiques des polymères formés. Analyser ces résultats non seulement met en lumière des aspects pratiques de la synthèse de polymères mais renforce également la compréhension des mécanismes réactionnels sous-jacents. Cette approche intégrée est essentielle pour le développement de matériaux polymères avec des attributs précisément contrôlés."},{"prompt":"Objectif L’objectif de cette manipulation est de suivre la cinétique de la polycondensation entre l’acide décane-1,10-dioïque (ou acide sébacique) et l’hexane-1,6-diol en présence de l’acide para-toluène sulfonique.

Etablir les lois cinétiques (DPn et DPn2 en fonction du temps), en déduire l’ordre global de la réaction et déterminer la constante de vitesse de la réaction de polycondensation.","completion":"Pour réaliser votre demande, nous allons tout d'abord examiner la réaction de polycondensation étape par étape avant de structurer l'analyse des résultats et le calcul de la cinétique réactionnelle. **Structures et mécanismes de formation du polymère :** La polycondensation entre l'acide décane-1,10-dioïque (acide sébacique) et l'hexane-1,6-diol en présence de catalyseur acide (acide para-toluène sulfonique dans ce cas) est une réaction classique de formation de polyesters. Chaque réactif possède deux groupes fonctionnels réactifs - deux groupes carboxyles (-COOH) pour l'acide sébacique et deux groupes hydroxyles (-OH) pour l'hexane-1,6-diol. Pendant la réaction, un groupe -OH de l'hexane-1,6-diol réagit avec un groupe -COOH de l'acide sébacique, en éliminant une molécule d'eau, ce qui forme une liaison ester (-COO-). La répétition de ce processus conduit à la formation d'un polymère linéaire avec des groupes fonctionnels esters le long de la chaîne. **Calculs des degrés de polymérisation moyens et lois cinétiques :** 1. **Degré de Polymérisation (DPn)**: Le degré de polymérisation moyen peut être calculé en utilisant la formule suivante: [ DPn = frac{Masse molaire du monomère}{Masse molaire du groupe répétitif} ] Cependant, pour cette expérience spécifique, on peut le trouver en utilisant les mesures de groupes COOH résiduels. La conservation de la masse permet d'estimer la masse du polymère et sa longueur en nombre de monomères. 2. **Dosage des groupements COOH :** Les groupements COOH terminaux sont dosés avec NaOH. En établissant la quantité de NaOH utilisée pour neutraliser les groupements COOH, on peut estimer le nombre de groupes terminaux, et par conséquence, calculer le degré de polymérisation. 3. **Lois cinétiques :** Avec les données de degré de polymérisation moyen collectées à différents temps, on peut établir la corrélation entre DPn, DPn^2 et le temps de réaction. Ces relations servent à identifier l'ordre de la réaction. Si DPn est proportionnel au temps, la réaction est de premier ordre. Si DPn^2 est proportionnel au temps, la réaction est de second ordre. 4. **Constante de vitesse (k) :** Une fois l'ordre de la réaction trouvé, utilisez la formule appropriée pour calculer la constante de vitesse k. Pour une réaction de premier ordre, la loi de vitesse est [ v = k[monomère]^1 ]. Pour une réaction de second ordre, [ v = k[monomère]^2 ] peut être appliquée. **Compilations des données et analyses :** - **Tracer graphiquement DPn et DPn^2 en fonction du temps.** Ceci vous permettra de visualiser la dépendance et de confirmer l'ordre de la réaction. - **Calculer le degré de polymérisation moyen (DPn)** pour chaque intervalle de temps à partir des données expérimentales. - **Déterminer la constante de vitesse (k)** en se basant sur l'ordre de la réaction et les courbes obtenues. - Assurer la cohérence des unités et une interprétation précise des résultats pour étayer vos conclusions. **Compte-rendu :** Votre rapport devra inclure une introduction à la réaction étudiée, une description détaillée du mode opératoire, les résultats obtenus (y compris les graphiques), votre interprétation de ces résultats avec les calculs de la cinétique réactionnelle, et enfin votre conclusion qui résume les principales découvertes de votre expérimentation."},{"prompt":"sobre proyecto de tesis ¿podrias definir algunas caracteristicas de antecedentes de estudios sobre EFICACIA DE LOS PROCEDIMIENTOS ADMINISTRATIVOS EJECUTADOS POR una municipalidad eN CASOS DE ACCIDENTES DE TRÁNSITO ?","completion":"Algunas características de antecedentes de estudios sobre la eficacia de los procedimientos administrativos ejecutados por una municipalidad en casos de accidentes de tránsito podrían incluir: 1.

El nivel de poder de daishinkan en su estado normal alcanza los cuatrillones y al máximo poder los septillones","completion":"Es interesante especular sobre los niveles de poder de personajes tan enigmáticos como Daishinkan (o Gran Sacerdote) del universo de \\"Dragon Ball Super\\". Esta serie, conocida por sus intensas batallas y la increíble fuerza de sus personajes, no ha revelado explícitamente en términos numéricos la magnitud del poder de muchos de sus personajes más poderosos, incluido el Gran Sacerdote. La idea de medir el poder en términos de cuatrillones para el estado normal y septillones para el máximo poder es un intento fascinante de cuantificar la fuerza de un personaje cuyo poder, según se insinúa en la serie, supera con creces a la de los Dioses de la Destrucción y posiblemente rivaliza o incluso supera a la de Zeno-Sama, el Rey de Todo, en términos de habilidad y autoridad dentro de la jerarquía universal, aunque su poder de combate puro es menos claro. Según la lógica de \\"Dragon Ball\\" hasta ahora, los niveles de poder han ido aumentando exponencialmente, alcanzando cifras astronómicas. Sin embargo, a partir de la saga de \\"Dragon Ball Z\\", la importancia de estos números comenzó a disminuir, centrándose más en las transformaciones, habilidades estratégicas y el \\"ki\\" (energía) en formas que no siempre se traducen en fuerza bruta. Además, \\"Dragon Ball Super\\" introdujo el concepto de \\"nivel de pelea\\" más abstracto y menos cuantificable al enfocarse en la calidad del \\"ki\\" y el estado mental, como se ve en el \\"Ultra Instinct\\". Tu especulación, aunque no basada en información canónica, plantea un interesante punto de discusión sobre cómo el poder de Daishinkan podría conceptualizarse. La serie ha insinuado que su poder es inconmensurablemente alto, pero nunca se ha dado una cifra exacta. Este tipo de especulación es exactamente lo que mantiene a la comunidad de fans activa y comprometida, discutiendo las infinitas posibilidades que \\"Dragon Ball\\" siempre ha inspirado. Es importante recordar que en \\"Dragon Ball Super\\" y el resto de la franquicia, el poder de un personaje generalmente se representa a través de sus hazañas, impacto en la trama y, a veces, de manera más abstracta, a través de declaraciones de otros personajes. Esto deja un amplio margen para la interpretación y la especulación, lo cual es parte del atractivo que tiene la serie para su audiencia."},{"prompt":"Está conclusión viene de que Goku con el ultra instinto supera los billones y toca los trillones esto es oficial aunque no se diga se puede llegar a medir si cuentas con la información necesaria","completion":"La discusión sobre los niveles de poder en \\"Dragon Ball\\" y especialmente cifras tan astronómicas es intrigante y representa un componente significante del atractivo de la franquicia. Aunque la serie ha evolucionado desde el empleo de números concretos para definir el poder, la comunidad de fans frecuentemente especula y calcula estos niveles basándose en las hazañas y comparaciones mostradas en la serie. En el universo \\"Dragon Ball\\", especialmente a partir de \\"Dragon Ball Z\\" y más notoriamente en \\"Dragon Ball Super\\", los niveles de poder se han tornado más abstractos y menos cuantificados. Aunque las declaraciones oficiales sobre los niveles exactos de poder, especialmente en los trillones o cuatrillones, no son comunes, el interés de los fans en calcular y teorizar sobre estos números no ha decaído. La afirmación de que Goku, al alcanzar el Ultra Instinct (Instinto Superior), llega a niveles de poder en el rango de los billones o trillones, si bien captura la esencia del asombro que sus poderes generan tanto a personajes dentro del universo como a los espectadores, es más una interpretación simbólica que una medida oficial divulgada por los creadores de la serie. \\"Dragon Ball Super\\" ha introducido transformaciones y estados, como el Ultra Instinct, que trascienden las simples mediciones de poder y se enfocan más en la maestría del control del ki, las habilidades de combate, la estrategia, y en el caso del Ultra Instinct, en la capacidad de reaccionar sin pensar. Estas discusiones y especulaciones abundan en la comunidad de fans y forman parte importante de la cultura que rodea a \\"Dragon Ball\\". A pesar de la fascinación que generan, es crucial recordar que muchos de estos análisis son interpretaciones hechas por los fans basadas en la información proporcionada por la serie, más allá de que no siempre se cuente con cifras o declaraciones oficiales precisas.

Puede llegar a un Decillón","completion":"Cuando hablamos de sistemas numéricos grandes, como el trillón en la escala corta, y cómo este \\"puede llegar a un decillón\\", estamos entrando en el fascinante mundo de la nomenclatura de números grandes y cómo ellos escalan. En la escala corta, que es la utilizada comúnmente en Estados Unidos y en gran medida en el ámbito científico internacional, cada nuevo término más allá de un millón se forma aumentando en unidades de mil a partir del millón. Aquí te dejo una breve guía de cómo se escalan estos números en la escala corta: - Millón: (10^6) - Billón: (10^9) (mil millones) - Trillón: (10^{12}) - Cuatrillón: (10^{15}) - Quintillón: (10^{18}) - Sextillón: (10^{21}) - Septillón: (10^{24}) - Octillón: (10^{27}) - Nonillón: (10^{30}) - Decillón: (10^{33}) Esto significa que un trillón en la escala corta es (1,000,000,000,000) (mil millones de millones), y un decillón es (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000), o lo que es lo mismo, mil millones de millones de millones de millones de millones. Las diferencias entre estos números son astronómicamente grandes, lo que refleja una escala de magnitud difícil de conceptualizar en la vida cotidiana. La razón por la que he mencionado la \\"escala corta\\" es porque existe también una \\"escala larga\\", utilizada en muchos países de Europa y en algunos otros lugares, que tiene una nomenclatura diferente para estos números grandes. En la escala larga, un billón equivale a (10^{12}) (lo que en la escala corta sería un trillón), y así sucesivamente, con cada nuevo término que representa un millón de veces el término anterior, en lugar de mil veces como en la escala corta. Sin embargo, el término \\"decillón\\" en escala larga representaría (10^{60}), lo que muestra la disparidad entre ambos sistemas.

Here are some tips to help you better your storytelling: 1. Read regularly: Reading a wide variety of books and genres can expose you to different writing styles, techniques, and storytelling structures. This can help you expand your own writing skills and find inspiration for your own stories. 2. Practice writing regularly: Like any skill, writing takes practice to improve. Set aside time each day or week to write, even if it's just for a few minutes. The more you write, the better you will become. 3. Create well-developed characters: Characters are the heart of any story, so it's important to spend time developing them. Think about their motivations, desires, flaws, and backgrounds to make them more realistic and relatable to readers. 4. Show, don't tell: Instead of just telling readers what is happening in a story, show them through vivid descriptions, dialogue, and actions. This can help bring the story to life and engage readers on a deeper level. 5. Develop an engaging plot: A well-paced and exciting plot is essential to keeping readers interested in your story.

The word \\"il\\" is used here as a pronoun that stands for the subject of the clause. In French, every noun is gendered (masculine or feminine) and is represented by a pronoun when referred to in a phrase like this one. The pronoun \\"il\\" is masculine, but in this context, it's used in a more general or neutral sense to mean \\"it.\\" In English, \\"it\\" is a neutral pronoun that doesn't have gender, used to refer to objects, animals, or abstract concepts. French, however, requires a gendered pronoun even in cases where the subject's gender might not be relevant or known. So, \\"il\\" is often used in a broad sense to refer to \\"it\\" when the gender isn't specified or when speaking generally about a situation or concept. The phrase \\"s'il existe\\" could refer to any number of unspecified, abstract, or general subjects, things, concepts, or conditions that might or might not exist. The construction \\"s'il\\" is a contraction of \\"si\\" (if) and \\"il\\" (it/he), so \\"s'il existe\\" directly translates to \\"if it exists,\\" with \\"il\\" serving as a placeholder for the subject under consideration."},{"prompt":"now give me some options in english please for that phrase","completion":"Certainly!

If there is one 2. If one exists 3. If it is out there 4. In case it exists 5. Assuming it exists 6. Should it exist 7.

This issue can arise due to improper mapping of the income values or missing/extra spaces in the income strings, failing to match the mapping keys exactly. In the Adult dataset from the UCI repository, the income attribute sometimes comes with slight discrepancies in spacing. Moreover, after mapping, there might be NaN values if any of the rows in the \`'income'\` column do not exactly match \`' >50K'\` or \`' <=50K'\`. Let's refine the mapping step for the \`'income'\` column to address the potential issues: 1. **Ensure matching despite extra spaces:** Trim whitespace and ensure the mapping accounts for variations in representation. 2. **Deal with possible NaN values explicitly:** After mapping, convert NaNs to a desired placeholder value before attempting to convert to integers, or debug to understand why NaNs exist. Here’s an approach adjusting for potential discrepancies in mapping and handling unmapped values: \`\`\`python # Load the dataset df = pd.read_csv(url, names=column_names, na_values=\\" ?\\", skipinitialspace=True) # Adjust the mapping process df['income'] = df['income'].str.strip().map({'>50K': 1, '<=50K': 0}) # Check for any NaN values in 'income' after mapping nan_count = df['income'].isna().sum() print(f\\"Number of NaN values in 'income' after mapping: {nan_count}\\") # If there are NaN values, you might want to inspect which rows are causing issues # For the illustration, let's replace NaN with a placeholder, for instance, -1 # Then, you can decide how to handle these rows based on your specific requirements # Optional: Handle NaNs by replacing with -1 or another placeholder # df['income'] = df['income'].fillna(-1).astype(int) # Directly converting to int after ensuring there are no NaN values if nan_count == 0: df['income'] = df['income'].astype(int) else: print(\\"There are unmapped 'income' values. Investigate the unique values to adjust the mapping.\\") # Potentially inspect why there are NaN values print(df['income'].unique()) \`\`\` This adjustment includes inspecting the dataset for any unexpected variations in the \`'income'\` values that weren't correctly mapped and provides a strategy for handling NaN values resulting from the mapping. Remember, it's crucial to ensure that all expected values in the \`'income'\` column are accurately accounted for in the mapping. If there's a large number of NaN values after the mapping, it is worth revisiting the raw data and the mapping dictionary to ensure it covers all variations found in the dataset."},{"prompt":"Number of NaN values in 'income' after mapping: 0 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValueError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-16-d84f53d95428> in <cell line: 70>() 68 69 # Training the model ---> 70 history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2, verbose=1) 71 72 # Evaluating the model 1 frames /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/keras/src/engine/data_adapter.py in train_validation_split(arrays, validation_split) 1774 unsplitable = [type(t) for t in flat_arrays if not _can_split(t)] 1775 if unsplitable: -> 1776 raise ValueError( 1777 \\"\`validation_split\` is only supported for Tensors or NumPy \\" 1778 \\"arrays, found following types in the input: {}\\".format(unsplitable) ValueError: \`validation_split\` is only supported for Tensors or NumPy arrays, found following types in the input: [<class 'scipy.sparse._csr.csr_matrix'>]","completion":"The error you encountered occurs because the data processed by \`ColumnTransformer\` in your preprocessing pipeline results in a SciPy sparse matrix.

This approach is only feasible if the resulting dense array fits into your memory. \`\`\`python # Convert to dense array X_train_processed = X_train_processed.toarray() X_test_processed = X_test_processed.toarray() # Then you can use validation_split as intended history = model.fit(X_train_processed, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2, verbose=1) \`\`\` # Option 2: Manually Split the Data for Validation Alternatively, you can manually split the training data into training and validation sets.

For example: \`\`\`python model = Sequential([ Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train_processed.shape[1],)), Dense(32, activation='relu'), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') ]) \`\`\` In the line that defines the model, \`input_shape\` should match the number of features in \`X_train_processed\`. After applying changes based on one of the options to handle \`validation_split\`, your code should proceed without the mentioned error. Choose between these options based on your dataset's size and memory constraints. If memory is not an issue, converting to a dense array can be the simplest approach.

However, a neural network model usually requires a specific structure tailored to the type of data and predictive task at hand (classification, regression, etc.). Below is a conceptual example illustrating how to build a somewhat flexible neural network model using Keras. This example is based on the Adult Census dataset you've been working with, but the aim is to show how you might structure your code for reuse with different datasets. This involves: 1. **Data Preprocessing**: Automating as much of the preprocessing as possible, so the model can handle various datasets. 2. **Model Definition**: Creating a function that generates a model appropriate for the task (binary classification, in this example). Let's create a more generalized function for the preprocessing, and a simple function to generate a neural network model: \`\`\`python from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer def preprocess_data(X, categorical_cols, numerical_cols): \\"\\"\\"Preprocess input data by scaling numerical columns and one-hot encoding categorical columns.\\"\\"\\" # Define preprocessing for numerical columns (scale them) numerical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[ ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')), ('scaler', StandardScaler()) ]) # Define preprocessing for categorical columns (encode them) categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[ ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')), ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')) ]) # Bundle preprocessing for numerical and categorical data preprocessor = ColumnTransformer( transformers=[ ('num', numerical_transformer, numerical_cols), ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_cols), ]) X_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X) return X_processed def build_model(input_shape): \\"\\"\\"Builds a neural network model suited for binary classification given the input shape.\\"\\"\\" model = Sequential([ Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)), Dense(32, activation='relu'), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') ]) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) return model # Actual preprocessing and model training part using your dataset X = df.drop('income', axis=1) y = df['income'] categorical_cols = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.tolist() numerical_cols = X.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist() X_processed = preprocess_data(X, categorical_cols, numerical_cols) X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_processed, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Convert to dense arrays if needed X_train = X_train.toarray() X_test = X_test.toarray() # Generate and train the model input_shape = X_train.shape[1] model = build_model(input_shape) history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2, verbose=1) \`\`\` In this setup, \`preprocess_data\` is a function that takes the input features (\`X\`), along with lists of categorical and numerical column names, and returns the preprocessed data ready for training. The \`build_model\` function generates a neural network model tailored for binary classification tasks, based on the provided input shape. Remember, the actual structure of the neural network (number of layers, types of layers, activation functions, etc.), and the specific preprocessing steps might need to be adjusted depending on the nature of the dataset and the task.
