However, in recent years, there has been an increasing global demand for clean and sustainable energy sources. Renewable energy, or energy derived from natural resources that replenish over time, has gained significant traction as a viable alternative to traditional energy sources. These energy sources include solar power, wind power, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and bioenergy. One of the most rapidly growing renewable energy sources is solar power. Solar energy harnesses the sun's radiation and converts it into electricity using photovoltaic cells or solar thermal collectors. These cells are becoming more efficient and affordable with technological advancements, making solar power more accessible to individuals and businesses alike. In addition, solar power has minimal environmental impact and can be installed on rooftops or in solar farms, making it a flexible and versatile energy source. Another major renewable energy source is wind power. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical power which can be used to generate electricity. Wind farms are being constructed globally, both onshore and offshore, taking advantage of regions with high wind speeds. With improvements in turbine design and increased investment in wind energy infrastructure, wind power has become a cost-effective and environmentally friendly source of electricity. Hydroelectric power has been in use for centuries but has recently undergone technological advancements to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact. By harnessing the power of flowing or falling water, hydroelectric plants can generate electricity through turbines. Although large-scale hydroelectric projects can have environmental consequences such as damming rivers, smaller-scale run-of-river systems have emerged as a more sustainable option. Additionally, geothermal energy utilizes the heat from the Earth's core to generate electricity or heat buildings. This energy is extracted through geothermal power plants that tap into hot water reservoirs underground. Geothermal energy has the advantage of being available around the clock, unlike solar or wind power, making it a reliable source of renewable energy. Lastly, bioenergy sources such as biomass and biofuels have gained attention as alternatives to fossil fuels. Biomass refers to organic matter derived from plants or animals that can be converted into heat, electricity, or biofuels. Biofuels, on the other hand, are fuels made from renewable biological resources, such as corn or sugarcane, which can replace gasoline or diesel in transportation. The shift towards renewable energy sources is driven by several factors. Firstly, there is growing concern about the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, particularly their contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy, being carbon-neutral or carbon-free, offers a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. Secondly, renewable energy sources are becoming more economically competitive. Costs of solar panels, wind turbines, and other technologies have significantly decreased, making them financially viable for both individuals and large-scale installations. In some cases, renewable energy has already reached grid parity, meaning it is as inexpensive as or cheaper than traditional sources of electricity. Thirdly, reducing dependence on fossil fuels enhances energy security. Fossil fuel prices are volatile and subject to geopolitical tensions, whereas renewable energy sources are abundant and accessible in most parts of the world. This diversification of energy sources reduces vulnerability to price fluctuations and supply disruptions. Lastly, the ongoing advancements in renewable energy technology are creating significant job opportunities and driving economic growth. As the demand for renewable energy increases, numerous new jobs are being created, ranging from manufacturing and installation to research and development. This offers a promising avenue for employment and stimulates the economy. In conclusion, the transition to renewable energy sources represents a pivotal shift in our global energy landscape. Solar power, wind power, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and bioenergy offer sustainable alternatives to traditional energy sources, with benefits ranging from reduced environmental impact to increased energy security and economic growth. As renewable energy continues to evolve and become more cost-effective, its widespread adoption will contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future."},{"prompt":"请写一个代码，用java满足以下要求：

Hypercube Sampling (LHS) approach to generate samples of input parameters and then runs an Abaqus Finite Element (FE) simulation for each sample. It calculates the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient matrix between each of the input parameters and the output responses (natural frequencies and MAC values). However, there are a few issues and missing parts that may prevent the code from working as expected. 1. **Y_mod and LHS_mod Variables**: The variable \`Y_mod\` is used to calculate the Spearman matrix but it isn't defined in the code provided. A commented-out code section exists which seems to filter out some data based on MAC values but it is not executed. The calculated \`rho\` values will not be accurate if \`Y_mod\` is not correctly filtered and assigned. 2. **Abaqus Script Execution**: The code uses \`os.system('abaqus cae noGUI=' + script_name)\` to run an Abaqus script without a graphical user interface (GUI). However, the Abaqus script \`script_name\` and its work are not shown. Successful execution of the Abaqus simulations and output file retrieval are critical for the code to proceed. 3. **Functions File**: The code is dependent on an external file named \`functions_py3\` for certain functions such as \`get_MAC_MMI\`. This external file needs to be correctly set up for importing and using these functions. 4. **Error Handling and Logging**: The code lacks error handling, logging, and status updates, which could make debugging very difficult, especially since it seems designed to run a large number of computationally expensive simulations. 5. **Plotting the Heatmap**: The plotting code snippet that generates the heat map (Spearman correlation matrix) seems complete, but it depends on the accurate calculation and filtering of the \`rho\` values mentioned above. 6. **Axis Labels**: The axis labels hardcoded in the plotting function should match the actual input parameters and output responses. Make sure these labels are consistent with the input ranges and outputs you are plotting. 7. **Use of \`time.sleep\`**: The code uses \`time.sleep()\` to give Abaqus simulations time to finish. This is not a reliable method to ensure the simulations are complete. It would be better to check the status of the simulations more robustly. Some best practices for improving the code would be to add proper exception handling, data validation, logging, and status updates to monitor the progress of the computations. Also, ensure the Abaqus model implements API calls that return success or error states to accurately gauge the simulation status and act accordingly. Lastly, before running the entire sensitivity analysis, try to run a small set of test cases or samples to ensure the whole pipeline works end-to-end, from sampling to running Abaqus simulations, data retrieval, and Spearman correlation calculation and visualization."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

故事的主人公是一个名叫小雨的女生。小雨一直以来都是一个十分内向和保守的人，对于自己的身体和隐私非常守口如瓶。她生活在一个小镇上，这个小镇非常传统和保守，人们对于裸体和性这些话题都非常避讳。 有一天，小雨收到了一个神秘的邮件，邮件的内容震撼了她。邮件中说，有一个摄影师看中了她的外貌，希望能邀请她成为他的裸体模特。一开始，小雨没有任何的回应，她觉得自己根本不适合这样的工作。然而，无论是她多么努力地忽略这个邮件，它总是像一个魔咒一样在她脑海中挥之不去。 几天后，小雨经过深思熟虑，她决定前往摄影师的工作室一探究竟。这是一个充满未知和挑战的旅程，小雨感到内心的抗拒和恐惧。 当小雨走进工作室的大门时，她被一股特殊的气氛所包围。空气中弥漫着一种奇异而令人心悸的感觉。她的腿有点颤抖，但她仍然坚定地走进去。 摄影师是一个中年男子，名叫李昂。他给人一种很有气场的感觉，让小雨感到有些不安和紧张。李昂告诉小雨，他很欣赏她的外貌和气质，并且相信她是一个非常合适的模特。 小雨当时并没有做出任何回应，她不知道自己是被夸奖还是被侮辱了。她望着李昂，试图从他的眼神中找出一些答案，但她只看到了一丝挑逗的笑容。 经过一段时间的思考和考虑，小雨最终决定接受李昂的邀请，成为他的裸体模特。这是一种对她来说既陌生又具有极高风险的工作。然而，她相信这是一个机会，可以让自己突破内心的束缚，勇敢面对一些根深蒂固的恐惧。 在第一次拍摄之前，小雨感到非常紧张。她的身体因为紧张而颤抖着，她的心跳声在耳边回响。她看着自己赤身裸体地站在灯光的照射下，她不禁回想起自己小时候被教育的那些保守的价值观。 然而，当她在镜头前展示自己的时候，一种难以言喻的刺激感涌上心头。她感到自己仿佛处于一种神秘和神圣的状态中，她开始慢慢从害羞和保守的女生转变为一个敢于挑战和拥抱身体的女性。 随着拍摄的深入，小雨越来越渴望展示自己的身体。她的思想逐渐适应了裸露的感觉，她对于自己的肉体产生了一种前所未有的自信和满足感。每一次的拍摄都像是一种仪式，她在那个过程中找到了一种奇妙的平衡和宁静。 然而，小雨并没有意识到，她对于裸露的追求正在逐渐超越仅仅是一种工作或表演的范畴。在她的内心深处，一种特殊的癖好悄然诞生。她开始渴望在公共场合中展示自己的身体，并从他人的目光中获得某种特殊的满足感。 这个癖好逐渐渗透进小雨的生活。她开始穿着暴露的服装，并在人群中自由地展示自己的身体。她享受着被注视的感觉，她那深藏在内心深处的自由和野性得以释放。 然而，随着时间的推移，小雨逐渐意识到她的行为带来了一些负面的后果。她开始成为人们议论的对象，她的行为引起了社会的争议。有人抨击她的行为是道德败坏，有人称赞她的勇气和自信。 小雨陷入了自我反思的境地。她开始怀疑自己的行为是否符合她本来的价值观。她意识到，她的渴望和追求是建立在外界的评价和关注之上的，她逐渐明白自己对于别人的目光成了一种心理上的依赖。 逐渐地，小雨重新找回了她曾经害羞和保守时的内心平静。她明白自己并不需要依赖别人的目光来肯定自己的价值。她决定停止她的展示行为，并投入到一个心理治疗的过程中，寻找内心的平衡和自我认知。 在心理治疗的过程中，小雨经历了一系列的情绪化起伏和内心的挣扎。她逐渐明白，她的渴望并不是一种健康的心理状态，她需要找到一种更合理和积极的方式来满足自己的需求。 通过与心理治疗师的交流，小雨学会了如何建立一个健康的自我认知和自尊。她也逐渐摆脱了对他人目光的依赖，并找到了属于自己的内心平静。 这个故事告诉我们，一个人的内心世界是极其复杂而令人难以理解的。在外表保守和内向的背后，或许隐藏着一个十分复杂的灵魂。我们需要尊重每个人的选择和行为，但同时也需要警惕自己的内心诉求是否偏离了我们本来的道德底线。最重要的是，我们应该努力建立健康的自我认知，不断探索和发展自己的内心世界。"},{"prompt":"Write down other related words or ideas that

Утренняя статья: Приветствую тебя, о прекрасный гость канала «Мир мужчин и женщин», где солнце встает не на востоке, а прямо в твоем смартфоне или ноутбуке в 7 часов утра по московскому времени! Ты когда-нибудь задумывался, каким может быть твой идеальный день? Происходит что-то волшебное, когда ты начинаешь свой день не с \\"не могу\\" или \\"не хочу\\", а с разгонной площадки энтузиазма и вдохновения. Но как подняться на эту площадку и совершить прыжок? Есть одна мудрая мысль: «Будьте батутом положительной энергии — впитывайте то, что вам нужно, и возвращайтесь обратно». Поговорим сегодня о том, как этот совет может стать твоей утренней зарядкой для сердца и ума. Так что же на самом деле означает этот проникновенный афоризм, легшего в основу нашего утреннего приключения? Ну, представим, что каждый из нас – это батут. Да-да, именно такой, на котором мы прыгали в детстве, испытывая безудержное веселье и радость. Мы отталкиваемся от земли, чтобы взлететь ввысь, пусть даже на краткий миг, и эта энергия в нас сохраняется. Но как на этом зацепиться? Подумай, как работает батут. Ты почти без усилия подскакиваешь, загружая его потенциальной энергией при каждом приземлении. А потом – оп! – и вот ты уже летишь ввысь с ветерком в лицо. Так и ты, будь гибким: впитывай уроки и положительные впечатления, чтобы затем отдать энергию окружающему миру, делая его чуточку лучше. Давай разберемся, кто же наш мудрец, дарующий нам такие слова? Дэйв Кэролан – не просто имя, это символ творчества и креативности. Этот цитатник обычно знают люди, искренне влюбленные в искусство жизни. И нет, Дэйв не фигура в истории античной философии и не имеет ничего общего с кельтскими бардами. На самом деле он – один из нас, современник, человек, пытающийся понять, как жить качественно и ярко. Теперь, как ты можешь применить эту мудрость в своей повседневной жизни? Ключевое слово – «впитывать». Каждое утро ты встречаешь мир, полный информации, эмоций, знаний и переживаний. Выбирай самое лучшее, что может питать твою энергию. То есть, если тебе по душе эта статья – впитай ее. Если что-то даёт тебе позитив – впитай это! И затем – отдавай. Но не как пустая беседа за чашкой кофе, а как дело, которое реально может изменить день к лучшему для тебя и для других. Заинтересован? Подписывайся, и ты узнаешь больше необычных идей, которые помогут стать лучшей версией себя. И самое забавное, что ты можешь не верить мне на слово. Проверь сам! Сделай маленький эксперимент – на сегодняшний день стань батутом. Попробуй впитать только хорошее и отдать еще больше хорошего. И посмотри, не станет ли твой мир чуть светлее и дружелюбнее. Помни, что если ты найдешь что-то стоящее – поделись с друзьями. Не стесняйся лайкать и комментировать, ведь это твой вклад в большой батут положительной энергии, который мы с тобой создаем. Итак, прыгай на батут своей мечты! И помни, каждый день ты можешь стать чуть лучше, ярче и счастливее. До завтра! А завтра – новая порция вдохновения, и это точно поднимет тебе настроение. Удачного дня и пусть он будет полон сюрпризов, как неожиданный скачок на батуте. Не забудь, что завтра в 7 утра мы опять встретимся здесь.

Curiosity consumed me as I picked it up and examined the label. There was no return address, only my name written in elegant, script handwriting. Intrigued, I rushed inside and tore open the package, revealing a beautifully crafted wooden box. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before, adorned with intricate carvings and a delicate latch that begged to be unlocked. As I carefully turned the box in my hands, I wondered who could have sent it and what could possibly be inside. Was it a gift from a long-lost relative or a forgotten friend? My mind raced with possibilities, but only one way to find out. I gently pressed the latch, and with a click, the box sprang open. To my surprise, I found a letter resting on a bed of purple velvet. I carefully unfolded the letter and read the elegant words written in the same script as my name on the package. It was a message from my late grandmother, whom I had lost many years ago. Tears welled up in my eyes as I read her heartfelt words of love and wisdom. She spoke of cherished memories and shared advice for navigating life's challenges. It felt as if she were right there with me, guiding me through the hardships I had faced since her passing. Nestled beneath the letter was a small, silver key, shining brightly in the dim light of my living room. Confusion and curiosity mingled within me. What could this key possibly open? Was it another hidden treasure left behind by my grandmother? Driven by an irresistible urge, I embarked on a search through every nook and cranny of my home. Drawers were pulled open, cabinets were examined, and old forgotten boxes were dug up from the attic. The house echoed with anticipation as I tried the key in various locks. Finally, as I stood before an antique wooden chest in my bedroom, the key slid seamlessly into the lock. With a gentle twist, the lid creaked open to reveal the most breathtaking scene. The chest contained a collection of my grandmother's most treasured possessions - love letters exchanged between her and my grandfather, photographs of ancestors I had never known, and a necklace that had been passed down through generations. Overwhelmed with emotion, I carefully removed the necklace from the chest and felt a rush of warmth envelop me. It was a symbol of my family's legacy and a reminder of the strength and love that flowed through our bloodline. As I fastened it around my neck, I couldn't help but feel an unbreakable connection to my ancestors and a renewed sense of purpose in my own life. The mysterious package and its contents had brought my grandmother back to life in a way I had never imagined. It was as if she had left behind a piece of her soul to guide me through my journey, reminding me that even in her absence, she would always be a part of me. From that day forward, the wooden box, the letter, and the key held a place of honor in my home. They served as a constant reminder of the unbreakable bond between generations and the importance of cherishing our family history. And whenever I needed inspiration or guidance, I would open the box, reread my grandmother's words, and feel her love surrounding me once more."},{"prompt":"Didn’t lockheed take the roswell ufo wreckage material and reverse engineer it","completion":"There are several conspiracy theories surrounding the alleged retrieval of UFO wreckage in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, and the subsequent reverse engineering of advanced technology by companies like Lockheed. It is important to note that these claims are largely speculative and have not been substantiated by evidence or official sources. The official account provided by the U.S. military in 1947 stated that the crash debris found in Roswell was from a weather balloon, a claim that was later revised to be a nuclear test surveillance balloon. However, this explanation has been hotly debated, leading to various alternate theories, including claims of extraterrestrial origins. As for the specific involvement of Lockheed in reverse engineering supposed UFO wreckage, there is no concrete evidence to support this. Lockheed Martin Corporation is an American aerospace and defense company, widely known for its contributions to aviation and defense technology.

We shall implement the following steps: 1. List all the files in the given path. 2. Filter out the image files (e.g., based on common image extensions). 3. Load the image file and perform basic processing (e.g., fetch its dimensions). 4. For each image file, check if the corresponding caption file exists, and load the caption. 5. Structure the data into \`Image\` and \`Caption\` objects and collect them into a list. 6. Allow for extension of distinct loading mechanisms for different caption file types. 7. Return the list of \`Image\` objects populated with the corresponding \`Caption\`.

You will need to install \`Pillow\` if not already installed (\`pip install Pillow\`). - The \`load_caption\` function handles opening and reading caption files. - The \`load_image\` function is a placeholder to process the images as needed. For now, it just opens the image, but you can add additional processing as required. - The \`load_path\` function orchestrates the whole process. It filters out image files, loads images, checks for caption files with the given extensions, and collects everything into a list of \`Image\` objects. - For simplicity, the \`Image\` and \`Caption\` classes have been changed to use simple initializers instead of the \`dataclass\` decorator, but you may implement \`dataclass\` if you prefer.

The WebP format is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. Pillow added support for WebP in version 2.9.0 (July 1, 2015), and since then, it has been possible to open and manipulate WebP images using the \`Pillow\` library in Python. Here is an example of how you would open a \`.webp\` image with Pillow: \`\`\`python from PIL import Image # Load the WebP image file image_path = 'path/to/image.webp' webp_image = Image.open(image_path) # Display the image webp_image.show() # Perform operations as with any other image format webp_image = webp_image.rotate(90) # Example: Rotate the image by 90 degrees # Save the image in a different format, if desired webp_image.save('path/to/image_converted.jpg') \`\`\` Ensure you have the WebP library installed on your system if you're working with WebP images. If you encounter any issues with handling WebP images using Pillow, you might need to ensure that both Pillow and your system's WebP library are up-to-date. To check your Pillow version, you can run: \`\`\`shell pip show pillow \`\`\` Or in Python: \`\`\`python import PIL print('Pillow version:', PIL.__version__) \`\`\` If necessary, update Pillow using: \`\`\`shell pip install --upgrade pillow \`\`\` Remember, you can easily add \`.webp\` to your list of accepted image extensions in the \`image_extensions\` tuple in the provided module code: \`\`\`python image_extensions = ('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.bmp', '.gif', '.webp') \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"How best would I implement a way of gathering all the images based on matching caption text?

I would also want to exclude terms, for example, if I wanted to exclude \\"male\\" from any matches, I could do \\"-male\\", and now if it finds \\"male\\" in the caption, it will reject including the image in the returned list, even if it matches the other terms, but again, it won't exclude \\"female\\" or \\"male_only\\", it will only exclude it if it matches \\"male\\" directly.","completion":"Implementing a robust search system with inclusion and exclusion criteria for filtering images based on caption text involves writing a more complex search function. To achieve this, we need to consider word boundaries for direct matches and also allow for pattern-based matches (e.g., wildcards). We can use regular expressions (regex) to provide the search functionality for pattern matching, including the wildcards and exclusion terms as specified. The Python \`re\` module offers functions that make it possible to check for matching patterns. Here's an updated code snippet that provides this functionality: \`\`\`python import re from typing import List # Other class definitions remain the same... def regex_from_pattern(pattern: str) -> str: ''' Convert a search pattern like \\"*male\\" to a regex pattern like \\".*bmaleb\\" (word boundary) ''' # Escape all regex special characters except asterisk (*) pattern = re.escape(pattern).replace('*', '.*') # Add word boundaries for exact word matching without asterisk if not pattern.startswith('.*'): pattern = 'b' + pattern if not pattern.endswith('.*'): pattern += 'b' return pattern def match_caption(caption: Caption, include_patterns: List[str], exclude_patterns: List[str]) -> bool: ''' Check if caption matches include patterns and doesn't match exclude patterns ''' for pattern in exclude_patterns: regex_pattern = regex_from_pattern(pattern) if re.search(regex_pattern, caption.caption): # Exclude the caption if it matches an exclude pattern return False for pattern in include_patterns: regex_pattern = regex_from_pattern(pattern) if not re.search(regex_pattern, caption.caption): # If a required include pattern is not found, return False return False return True def search_with_patterns(images: List[Image], include_patterns: List[str], exclude_patterns: List[str]) -> List[Image]: matched_images = [] for image in images: if any(match_caption(caption, include_patterns, exclude_patterns) for caption in image.captions): matched_images.append(image) return matched_images # Loading images from path would be the same as before... # Example usage if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": images = load_path('path/to/images') # Example search parameters include_patterns = [\\"*male\\", \\"*happy*\\"] # Want these patterns to be included exclude_patterns = [\\"-male\\", \\"-sad\\"] # Want these patterns to be excluded matched_images = search_with_patterns(images, include_patterns, exclude_patterns) for img in matched_images: print(f'Image file: {img.image_file}') for caption in img.captions: print(f'Caption: {caption.caption}') \`\`\` Here's what the above functions do: - \`regex_from_pattern\` function converts a search pattern into a regex pattern suitable for matching whole words, with special handling for the wildcards (*). - \`match_caption\` function takes a \`Caption\` object and a list of include and exclude patterns and returns True if the caption matches all include patterns and none of the exclude patterns. - \`search_with_patterns\` takes the whole list of \`Image\` objects and the search patterns and filters the images based on their captions. This code supports the use of \`*\` as a wildcard that matches any number of characters, and \`-\` as an indicator for exclusion. It takes care to match the whole words unless wildcards are used. For example, a pattern \`male\` would match only the exact word \\"male\\", while \`*male\` would match \\"female\\" and \\"male\\", and \`*male*\` would match \\"male\\", \\"female\\" and \\"male_only\\". Exclude patterns that start with \`-\` will be used to exclude any captions that exactly match the subsequent term. **Note**: Regular expressions are powerful and can be complex, so ensure your search patterns are correctly formulated to avoid unexpected matches or no matches. Regular expression patterns that contain special characters should be constructed with care."},{"prompt":"if you have two separate lists for include and exclude, it doesn't make sense to have the \\"-\\", either it should be one list that automatically determines if a term includes wildcards, or is excluded with \\"-\\", or keep it to two lists, but remove the need for \\"-\\".","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. You are correct; if you have two separate lists for including and excluding terms, the \`-\` prefix for the exclude patterns is unnecessary.

The \`match_caption\` function first checks for matches against the \`exclude_patterns\` list, which immediately disqualifies a caption if a pattern matches. It then checks the \`include_patterns\` list to ensure at least one pattern matches the caption.

BACKSLASH_B represents a word boundary marker (b). \\"\\"\\" # If the pattern starts or ends with \`*\`, match any characters before or after pattern = re.escape(pattern) if pattern.startswith(\\"\`ASTERISK\`\\"): pattern = \\"DOTAST\\" + pattern[10:] # Remove the \\"\`ASTERISK\`\\" after escaping else: pattern = \\"BACKSLASH_B\\" + pattern if pattern.endswith(\\"\`ASTERISK\`\\"): pattern = pattern[:-10] + \\"DOTAST\\" else: pattern += \\"BACKSLASH_B\\" # Replace escaped spaces with literal spaces for phrase matching pattern = pattern.replace(\\" \\", \\" \\") return pattern \`\`\` Note in the comments, \`DOTAST\` stands for \`.*\` which matches any character (except for line terminators) zero or more times. \`BACKSLASH_B\` stands for word boundary \`b\`. Let's also clarify the \\"start\\" and \\"end\\" replacement within the pattern: - The start: When the pattern starts with the escaped version of \\"\`*\`\\", which is \\"\`ASTERISK\`\\", this is a 10 character string after escaping (with backticks taken into account). We want to replace this with \\"\`.*\`\\", not a single period. - The end: Similar to the start, when the pattern ends with \\"\`ASTERISK\`\\", we want to drop the last 10 characters and append \\"\`.*\`\\". These changes now account for the use of backticks (\`) in the pattern, which represent the asterisk (*) to avoid chat formatting issues. When translating the pattern into regex, you would replace \`DOTAST\` with \`.*\` and \`BACKSLASH_B\` with \`b\`. Here's an example of this process where we would translate \`DOTAST\` back to \`.*\`: \`\`\`python regex_string = regex_from_pattern(\\"\`*\`male\\") # When interpreting \`regex_string\`, replace \`DOTAST\` with \`.*\` and \`BACKSLASH_B\` with \`b\` # so it becomes '.*bmaleb' \`\`\` If this concept works well for you, be sure to also update the matching functions to interpret these placeholders (\`DOTAST\` and \`BACKSLASH_B\`) back into their regex equivalents before conducting the search. Since we cannot share backslashes and other regex special characters directly without potentially losing formatting, please ensure you rewrite the \\"long-form\\" words back into their appropriate regex syntax if you copy this code into your editor or IDE."},{"prompt":"From a file path like: \`D:AI Generation_Repositorytraining datasets_Downloadsmother_and_daughter00ed6598a83b9bef270d9b5ff7c6dc6c.jpg\` I want to copy the image file to a new location with the same file name, including the caption file, here is my skeleton code within the main part of the .py file: \`\`\` # Copy matched images to new location copy_to = R'D:AI GenerationProjectsTrainingConceptPOV Sex v0.4img1_handjob art' for img in matched_images: print(f\\"Copying {img.image_file}\\") \`\`\`","completion":"To copy image files and their corresponding caption files to a new location, you'll need to use the \`shutil\` module in Python, which provides a \`copy\` function.

The tournament was in full swing. It's time for Reyna and her sister Lily to enter the training ground for the exhibition fight. Ten-year-old Lily stood opposite Reyna in a fighting stance. Reina released the power of black flames and clots of powerful energy swirled around her.","completion":"The crowd fell into a hush as the sisters took their positions in the center of the sun-drenched training ground, a makeshift arena festooned with vibrant banners of the realm's noble houses. An air of anticipation clung to the onlookers, nobles and commoners alike, as they were about to witness an unprecedented display of martial and mystical prowess. Reyna, tall and clad in close-fitting leather armor etched with silver filigree, surveyed her younger sister with an expression that was a curious blend of pride and melancholy. In contrast, Lily's attire was a simple tunic and breeches, her unmarred armor indicative of her novice status. Yet, there she stood, barely ten winters behind her, eyes alight with determination and a tender hint of defiance. As the tournament's trumpets blared, Reyna's heart quickened, feeling the familiar surge of adrenaline mingled with the raw energy of her arcane gift. She extended her arm, and her hand became a vessel for the dark flames that danced eagerly at her command. Murmurs rose from the crowd, a collective intake of breath at the sight of the mystical fire that violated the natural order, pitch as the starless sky, ominous in its crackling hunger. The sun bore down upon the combatants, casting dramatic shadows that seemed to emphasize the stark difference in their experience. A seasoned warrior against a budding squire made for a poignant tableau, yet this was no ordinary sparring match. It was an exhibition fight, where the strength of blood and love was pitted against the raw fury of the elements. Lily's stance tightened, her small frame coiled like a sprig primed to unfurl at the first whisper of spring. In her hand was a wooden practice sword, a laughable contrast to the powers her sister wielded. But the light in the young girl's eyes spoke of an inner fire that matched the dark blaze of Reyna's magic—a preternatural calm, a readiness that belied her age. With no further signal needed, the battle commenced. Reyna advanced with the grace of a hunting catamount, her every step measured, each flowing movement a testament to her mastery over her body and the shadows she commanded. Black flames licked the air around her, swirling into clots of powerful energy that pulsated with destructive promise. Lily darted forward, a blur of youthful agility, her movements weaving a pattern that spoke of countless hours spent with a tutor. She ducked beneath a lance of shadowy fire, rolled to the side of a swelling orb of abyssal energy, and came up with her wooden blade singing through the air as she aimed for where Reyna's defenses might falter. But Reyna was no mere trainee caught off guard; she conducted the fight like a maestro wielding a conductor's baton. Even as her black flames sought to corner her sister, they danced to her command, never extending beyond the margins of safety, never truly threatening. It was a spectacle—a choreography of destruction held in careful check by sisterly love. Every attack Reyna made was met with Lily's counter, the child's exuberance battling her sister's reserve. Such was the art of the exhibition, a display meant to thrill but not to wound. The onlookers were enraptured as the dark flames and the gleam of sweat on Lily's brow told the story of family, of honor, and the unspoken understanding that bound the hearts of the two sisters in a ring where only one could emerge victorious. Yet in this moment, under the watchful gaze of the realm, they were more than victor and vanquished; they were a legacy brought to life, a promise that the fires of the future would be guided by the tempered hands of the past—and for an instant, there was no sound but that of beating hearts and the whisper of black flames reaching skyward."},{"prompt":"Chen et al. reported that Ni2+ dopants can promote electron transfer and charge separation via influencing the electronic structure of titanium oxo clusters in NH2-MIL-125.

A symbol of grace, in a world that's rare, Tell me, who is this, roaming without a care?"},{"prompt":"Tell the polar bear story","completion":"Once upon a time, in the vast and snowy wilderness of the Arctic, there lived a majestic creature known as the polar bear. These bears were the ultimate masters of survival in the frigid, icy lands they called home. In the land of shimmering snow and freezing temperatures, polar bears were perfectly adapted to their environment. Their thick fur provided insulation and camouflaged them amidst the glistening white surroundings. Strong and agile, they navigated through icy waters and treacherous terrains with ease. The polar bear's kingdom was the frozen oceans, where they spent much of their time hunting for seals. With a keen sense of smell, they could detect the scent of a seal from miles away, even beneath the thick layer of ice. Patiently, they would wait by a seal's breathing hole, anticipation coursing through their bodies. And when the perfect moment arrived, they would pounce, with lightning-fast speed and remarkable precision. These magnificent creatures were not just skilled hunters; they were also loving parents. Female polar bears built dens in the snow where they would give birth and raise their cubs. These dens provided necessary shelter from the harsh winter conditions, ensuring the cubs' survival. As time passed, however, the polar bears faced a challenge they had never encountered before: the changing climate. The Earth grew warmer, and the ice on which they relied began to melt at an alarming rate. Sea ice, essential for hunting and traveling, became scarcer, forcing polar bears to swim longer distances to find food and seek refuge. It was a time of uncertainty and adaptation for polar bears. As their icy world slowly diminished, they ventured onto land more frequently, in search of alternatives. These powerful creatures displayed their resilience, finding new opportunities and making the best of their situation. But as the plight of the polar bears became known to humans, efforts were made to protect and conserve their dwindling habitat. People around the world started to realize the importance of preserving the Arctic ecosystem, not just for the polar bears but for our planet as a whole. The polar bear story serves as a reminder of the delicate balance nature maintains and the impact of climate change on our beloved wildlife. These resilient creatures, symbols of strength, adaptability, and grace, continue to inspire us to protect and preserve the wonders of our world."},{"prompt":"Define a charismatic species","completion":"A charismatic species refers to a type of animal or plant that possesses notable traits or characteristics that captivate and engage people's attention and emotions. These species often possess qualities such as beauty, unique physical attributes, or fascinating behavior patterns that make them particularly appealing and endearing to humans. Charismatic species often serve as flagship or iconic representatives of different ecosystems or conservation causes. They can generate public interest, support, and raise awareness for broader conservation efforts, as their charismatic qualities make them relatable and easily evoke empathy and concern. For instance, charismatic species like polar bears, tigers, elephants, pandas, and dolphins are frequently featured in conservation campaigns and are symbols of global conservation efforts. Their unique characteristics, such as their cuddly appearance, impressive strength, or playful behavior, make them beloved by many and draw attention to the preservation of their habitats and the overall biodiversity of our planet. While the concept of charismatic species can help rally support for conservation, it is crucial to remember that all species, regardless of their charm or appeal, play essential roles in ecological systems. Every species contributes to the complex balance of life on Earth, and their preservation is important for the overall health and sustainability of our planet."},{"prompt":"Examples of acharismatic endangered species","completion":"While charismatic species often receive more attention and public support for conservation efforts, it is essential to remember that numerous endangered species lack the same level of public appeal, despite their critical ecological importance. Here are a few examples of endangered species that may be considered less charismatic: 1. Amur Leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis): The Amur leopard is one of the rarest big cats on the planet, facing threats such as habitat loss and poaching. Despite its stunning beauty and agility, this elusive leopard remains relatively unknown compared to its charismatic counterpart, the African leopard. 2. Vaquita (Phocoena sinus): The vaquita is one of the smallest and most endangered cetaceans, with only a handful estimated to remain in the wild. Living in the Gulf of California, this porpoise has faced the consequences of illegal fishing practices, leading to entanglement in fishing nets. Its small size and shy nature contribute to its lack of recognition. 3. Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus): The Hainan gibbon is one of the rarest primates in the world, confined to a small area on Hainan Island in China. With less than 30 individuals remaining in the wild, this gibbon faces habitat loss due to deforestation and is threatened by hunting and poaching. Its low profile and limited distribution have made its conservation plight less well-known. 4. Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis): The smaller of the two Asian rhino species, the Sumatran rhinoceros is critically endangered, primarily due to habitat loss and poaching for its horn. With fewer than 80 individuals estimated to survive in fragmented populations, this rhino struggles for survival. Its elusive nature, coupled with its solitary and shy behavior, has limited public awareness and support. It is crucial to recognize and promote the conservation of these less charismatic species. While they may not capture public attention as easily, they play significant roles in their ecosystems and are equally deserving of our efforts to protect and preserve their habitats."},{"prompt":"como usar o chatgpt com flutter","completion":"Para integrar o ChatGPT em um aplicativo Flutter, você precisa seguir estes passos: 1.

Thunderbolt 4 supports up to two 4K displays or a single 8K display. To connect four 2K monitors, which have a lower resolution than a single 8K or two 4K displays, you would typically need a Thunderbolt 4 dock that supports multi-stream transport (MST) or daisy-chaining, if the monitors support it. MST allows for multiple displays to be driven from a single Thunderbolt 4 connection by treating each display as a separate data stream within the Thunderbolt connection. However, MST and daisy-chaining for multiple displays are more commonly supported in DisplayPort rather than Thunderbolt directly. Thunderbolt 4 docks that offer this functionality will usually have additional built-in DisplayPort outputs, and some docks allow you to use adaptors or converter hubs from these DisplayPorts to split the signal to multiple monitors. It's important to check the specifications of the host device, the Thunderbolt 4 controller, and the dock or adapter you plan to use to ensure compatibility with four 2K monitors. Keep in mind that even if the hardware and connectivity support this setup, performance may vary depending on the workload and the capability of the GPU in the host device. Before proceeding, I recommend checking with the manufacturer of the dock or adapter for specific compatibility details and to ensure support for your planned monitor configuration."},{"prompt":"How did chadwick boseman die?

Итоговое разбиение выбирается на основе минимизации этой функции потерь. Таким образом, результаты всех запусков усредняются для получения наилучшей кластеризации. Использование нескольких начальных центроидов и усреднение результатов позволяют уменьшить вероятность зависания в локальном оптимуме и достигнуть более стабильных результатов.

Крючковые вопросы: Насколько важна для вас свежесть ваших мыслей по утрам? Когда вы в последний раз чувствовали, что ваша мотивация нуждается в \\"освежении\\"? Как вы думаете, почему мы каждый день принимаем душ? Мыслили ли вы о том, что мотивация, как и личная гигиена, требует регулярности? Текст статьи: Доброе утро, мои дорогие читатели \\"Мира Мужчин и Женщин\\"! Как вы наверняка уже замечали, мы не забываем о вас каждое утро в 7 часов по Москве. И вот сегодня мы снова вместе, готовы начать новый день с зарядом свежести и вдохновения. Сразу хочу уделить несколько слов нашему драгоценному Зигу Зиглару. Вы знаете, кто это такой? Зиг - известный мотивационный оратор и гуру в области успеха, чей остроумный подход помог миллионам людей. Итак, к чему приводит нас утренняя мудрость Зига? Он говорит: «Люди часто говорят, что мотивация недолговечна. Ну, и купание тоже — вот почему мы рекомендуем это ежедневно». Это забавное, но в то же время глубокомысленное наблюдение. Давайте разберемся, что же значит эта фраза. Мы все заботимся о личной гигиене, верно? Мы принимаем душ, чтобы смыть пыль дня, освежиться, ощутить себя чистыми и новыми. А мотивация? Она, как нежный аромат вашего любимого мыла, со временем испаряется. Чтобы чувствовать себя вдохновленными, нам необходимо \\"подпитывать\\" нашу внутреннюю мотивацию каждый божий день. Но как? Прежде всего, стоит осознать, что мотивация - это не магическая пилюля, которая сама по себе принесет вам успех и счастье. Это инструмент, который требует непрерывной заточки. Ну а теперь давайте перейдем к легким и приятным ритуалам, которые помогут нам сделать эту рутинную \\"заточку\\" интересной и эффективной. Как же поддерживать постоянную мотивацию? Подойдем к этому вопросу с юмором: если бы мотивация была пиццей, сколько кусочков вы бы съели на завтрак? Наверное, достаточно, чтобы не чувствовать голод вплоть до обеда, верно? Так и с мотивацией - начните ваш день с \\"ютного завтрака\\" положительных мыслей или маленькой викторины на тему, что сегодня поможет вам ощутить себя успешным. Как насчет \\"утренней зарядки\\" для мозга? Можно потратить первые 10 минут дня на чтение мотивационной книги или статьи (как, например, эта!). Может, сделать краткий план на день, где главным пунктом будет что-то, что действительно заставит ваше сердце биться быстрее. Или даже стать супергероем для кого-то, сделав неожиданное, но приятное действие для близкого человека."},{"prompt":"translate this :Four different kinds of learner Learner A: People in this group adapt and integrate observations into complex but logically sound theories.

Piensan los problemas de manera vertical y lógica, asimilando hechos dispares en teorías coherentes. Tienden a ser perfeccionistas y no descansan hasta que todo esté ordenado y forme parte de un esquema racional. Les gusta analizar y sintetizar, y están interesados en supuestos básicos, principios, teorías, modelos y sistemas. Su filosofía valora la racionalidad y la lógica, por lo que hacen preguntas como: \\"¿Tiene sentido?\\", \\"¿Cómo se relaciona esto con aquello?\\" y \\"¿Cuáles son los supuestos básicos?\\". Tienden a ser analíticos y dedicados a la objetividad racional en lugar de lo subjetivo o ambiguo, abordando los problemas de manera lógica y consistente. Esto es su \\"marco mental\\" y rechazan rígidamente cualquier cosa que entre en conflicto con él. Prefieren maximizar la certeza y se sienten incómodos con juicios subjetivos, pensamiento lateral y cualquier cosa que trate el asunto en cuestión con menos respeto del que sienten que merece. Estudiante B: Estas personas son entusiastas en probar ideas, teorías y técnicas para ver si funcionan en la práctica. Buscan activamente nuevas ideas y aprovechan la primera oportunidad para experimentar con aplicaciones. Son el tipo de personas que regresan de cursos llenos de nuevas ideas que quieren probar en la práctica. Les gusta avanzar y actuar rápidamente y con confianza en las ideas que les atraen, y tienden a resentir cualquier regla o regulación que pueda obstaculizar su implementación. También suelen impacientarse con discusiones que consideran que no están orientadas a metas, y su atención pronto comienza a decaer si sienten que están dando vueltas en círculos. En esencia, son personas prácticas y realistas que les gusta tomar decisiones prácticas y resolver problemas. Ven los problemas y las oportunidades como un desafío, y su filosofía es: \\"Siempre hay una mejor manera\\" y \\"Si funciona, es bueno\\". Estudiante C: Las personas en este grupo se involucran plenamente y sin prejuicios en nuevas experiencias. Disfrutan del aquí y ahora y están contentos de ser dominados por experiencias inmediatas. Son de mente abierta y no escépticos, lo que los hace entusiastas de cualquier cosa nueva. Su filosofía es: \\"Lo intentaré una vez\\", por lo que tienden a actuar primero y considerar las consecuencias después. Sus días están llenos de actividad y abordan los problemas mediante lluvia de ideas. Tan pronto como la emoción de una actividad disminuye, están ocupados buscando la siguiente, ya que tienden a prosperar con el desafío de nuevas experiencias, pero se aburren con la implementación y la consolidación a largo plazo. A estas personas les gusta reflexionar sobre las experiencias y observarlas desde diferentes perspectivas. Estudiante D: Recopilan datos, tanto de primera mano como de otros, y prefieren pensar detenidamente antes de llegar a una conclusión. La recopilación y análisis minucioso de datos sobre experiencias y eventos es lo que cuenta, por lo que tienden a posponer la toma de decisiones definitivas el mayor tiempo posible. Su filosofía es ser cautelosos, nunca hacer conjeturas sin fundamentos o sacar conclusiones precipitadas. Son personas reflexivas a las que les gusta considerar todos los ángulos y las implicaciones posibles antes de actuar, y se mostrarán reacias a involucrarse en actividades que otros propongan sin haber considerado cuidadosamente el resultado probable. Adoptan un perfil bajo y tienen un aire ligeramente distante, tolerante y sereno.

The tournament was in full swing. It's time for Reyna and her sister Lily to enter the training ground for the exhibition fight. Ten-year-old Lily stood opposite Reyna in a fighting stance. Reina released the power of black flames and clots of powerful energy swirled around her. Lily understood that she was weak and that she was much weaker than her fifteen-year-old sister.","completion":"Amidst the cacophony of a crowd that had gathered for the tournament, the sun stood sentinel in the clear blue sky. The air simmered with anticipation, for this was the moment when tales would be spun and legends would be made. The arena was a canvas, the sands within were untouched by the boots of the day's earlier competitors. It was their stage now—Reyna and Lily, sisters bonded by blood yet set to dance in mock combat for the throng's delight. Reyna, at fifteen, bore the mantle of a blossoming warrior. Tall and lean, her gaze was as sharp as the sword she held loosely by her side. Raven locks tumbled over her shoulders, a stark contrast to the vibrant glow of her power. The essence of black flames coiled around her like tendrils of shadow, whispering of her prowess to control the darkness. She was the tempest made flesh, her every move echoed by the whirling energy that threatened to escape her will. Opposite her, Lily stood determined, a figure diminutive and elfin compared to her sister. Just ten winters had graced her with sweet youthfulness, her presence ethereal against the backdrop of martial ferocity that the tournament stood for. Delicate hands clasped the wooden practice sword—a stark contrast to Reyna's steel. Lily's stance spoke of training, but it was the innocence in her eyes that betrayed her. She understood, with the quiet acceptance of a child, that she stood not as an equal in strength, but as a sparrow before the storm. Their gazes locked—verdant green of Lily’s eyes against the stormy grey of Reyna's—and in that silent exchange, a story older than time unfolded. The tale of the underdog, the eternal hope that danced in the heart of the crowd, it rested on Lily's shoulders like a fragile crown. The master-at-arms, a grizzled veteran who had seen more summers than even the oldest tapestries could tell, raised his hand high. His voice boomed across the grounds, and with a dropped arm, the exhibition fight began. Reyna advanced with feline grace, her flames held at bay by an iron will. She could not, would not, unleash her fury upon her sister, yet she knew the dance must look authentic. The energy that swirled around her, eager for release, was tempered by restraint as she swung her blade in a controlled arc—a warning, not a threat. Lily, eyes wide and breath held tight, moved as she had been taught. A step to the side, a darting movement forward, she met her sister's steel with her wooden counter. There was no clang of metal, only the soft thud of wood parrying calculated blows. It was clear that Lily was playing a game of survival, not conquest. Beneath the spectacle, the crowd found themselves in the thrall of an unfolding drama—not of a duel destined for conclusion by force, but of a duet that spoke more of affection than rivalry. Each parry by Lily drew murmurs of a hope that defied reason, and every measured strike by Reyna told of a love that would not harm, would not overpower. As minutes unfurled like the petals of a morning bloom, the world shrank to the space between two sisters. And in that moment, with the tournament grounds as witness, Lily moved not just with the instruction of arms, but with the heart of a lioness, a flurry of activity that spoke of her will to stand as Reyna's equal. Her wooden blade became an extension of her earnest spirit, and for a brief second, her sister's flames dimmed in respect of an inner fire that matched their intensity. At last, Reyna halted, lowering her sword with a proud smile. In an act of both concession and acclaim, she dipped her head to Lily, the small warrior who had shown that strength was not merely a measure of power, but of courage. And it was courage that drew the loudest cheers from the crowd, for in Lily's wide, glowing eyes they saw the reflection of their own unspoken dreams. The exhibition match, though lacking in the ferocity of other bouts, ended with a quiet dignity. Two sisters exited the training ground amidst applause, the black flames around Reyna receding into the recesses of her being. Hands clasped together, they no longer stood as combatants in an arena, but as symbols of the indomitable spirit that lived within the heart of every being who dared dream beyond the confines of their strength."},{"prompt":"How can you explain the decline in prices for sweet potatoes and turkeys precisely at the time when we all want more of them?!?!

As a result, there is typically a larger supply of these items in the market, leading to increased competition among sellers. This increased supply contributes to a decline in prices. 2. Promotional Pricing: Retailers often offer promotional pricing and discounts on sweet potatoes and turkeys during the Thanksgiving season to attract more customers and increase sales volume. This competitive pricing strategy can cause prices to drop as retailers try to outdo each other and capture a larger share of the market. 3. Seasonality: Sweet potatoes and turkeys are seasonal products, with peak harvest times occurring in the months leading up to Thanksgiving. As the supply of these products increases due to the seasonal harvest, their prices tend to decrease due to the abundance of available produce. 4. Economies of Scale: The demand for sweet potatoes and turkeys surges around Thanksgiving, which allows farmers and producers to benefit from economies of scale. With increased volume in production, costs per unit tend to decrease, allowing for lower prices without impacting profitability significantly. However, it is important to note that these factors can vary from one year to another and are influenced by various market conditions and external factors beyond what is mentioned above."},{"prompt":"Thanksgiving has been celebrated on the 4th Thursday of November every year since the 1940s. When the holiday was established in the 19th century, it was actually celebrated on the final Thursday of the month. There was great controversy in 1939 because the final Thursday of the month happened to fall on November 30th, leaving far fewer shopping days before the Christmas holiday than when the date fell earlier in the month. Part A: If moving the Thanksgiving Day earlier is good for retail sales (there are more shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas), do you think there will be pressure to keep moving it earlier?","completion":"Yes, there may be pressure to keep moving Thanksgiving earlier if it is perceived to be beneficial for retail sales. The primary reason for this pressure would be to maximize the number of shopping days available between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as a longer shopping period is generally seen as advantageous for retailers. Increased time between Thanksgiving and Christmas allows for extended promotional periods, longer holiday sales, and greater opportunities to attract consumers. Retailers often rely heavily on the holiday shopping season to boost their sales and profits, so anything that can potentially enhance this period may be considered favorable. However, it is important to note that moving the date of Thanksgiving could also face resistance or pushback from various stakeholders. Traditionalists and individuals who value the historical significance of Thanksgiving being celebrated on a fixed date may oppose any changes. Additionally, altering the date can have implications on other aspects of American culture, such as travel plans, family traditions, and cultural significance attached to the holiday. Ultimately, any decision regarding the date of Thanksgiving would require careful consideration of numerous factors, including the potential impact on retail sales, cultural traditions, and the overall sentiment of the public."},{"prompt":"can you come up with more economic points regard this question?","completion":"Certainly! Here are some additional economic points to consider regarding the potential pressure to keep moving Thanksgiving earlier: 1. Black Friday Sales: The day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, has become a significant retail event in the United States. Retailers heavily rely on the increased footfall and sales during this period. By moving Thanksgiving earlier, retailers can potentially extend the Black Friday sales period, allowing for more opportunities to attract consumers and boost revenue. 2. Consumer Behavior: Shifting Thanksgiving earlier may align with consumer shopping behavior. Many consumers tend to start their holiday shopping soon after Thanksgiving, looking for deals and discounts. By extending the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, retailers can cater to consumer preferences and capture a larger share of their holiday spending. 3. Demand and Inventory Management: Adapting the timing of Thanksgiving can help retailers manage demand and inventory more effectively. By starting the shopping season earlier, retailers can spread out customer traffic over a longer period, reducing the strain on inventory and logistical operations. This can potentially lead to more efficient inventory turnover and smoother supply chain management. 4. Competition and Market Dynamics: If one or more retailers decide to start their holiday sales earlier, others might feel compelled to follow suit to remain competitive and avoid losing market share. This competitive pressure can potentially drive the overall shift towards an earlier Thanksgiving celebration, influenced by retailers' desire to attract customers before their competitors do. 5. Economic Impact: Extending the holiday shopping season can have positive economic effects beyond just retail sales. It can lead to increased consumer spending, job creation (seasonal and temporary), and overall economic growth. Retailers and related industries, such as transportation, logistics, and hospitality, may benefit from the longer shopping period. It is worth mentioning that these economic points should be weighed against various social, cultural, and traditional factors associated with Thanksgiving. Any decision to change the date of Thanksgiving would require careful consideration of the overall impact on society, while balancing economic interests."},{"prompt":"will this early thing give pressure to retailers or to other people or stuff?","completion":"The shift of Thanksgiving to an earlier date can create both pressures and challenges for various stakeholders. Here is an overview of how different entities might be influenced: 1. Retailers: Retailers may face pressures stemming from an earlier Thanksgiving. While moving the date earlier can potentially offer more shopping days before Christmas, it can also pose challenges for retailers. They will have limited time to plan and execute their holiday marketing strategies, prepare inventory, and manage staffing during the busy holiday season. The compressed timeline can increase operational pressures on retailers, requiring efficient and effective execution of sales, promotions, and logistics. 2. Employees: An earlier Thanksgiving may impact the workforce, particularly retail employees who play a crucial role during the holiday shopping season. Some employees may need to adjust their schedules and work longer hours to accommodate the shorter period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. This could lead to increased stress, fatigue, and potential labor issues if not managed properly. 3. Consumers: An earlier Thanksgiving can benefit consumers as they have more opportunities to take advantage of holiday promotions, discounts, and sales. It provides a longer period for planning purchases and can alleviate pressure to make rushed decisions during a shorter shopping season. However, the compressed timeframe could also create additional time constraints and stress for some consumers, particularly if they rely heavily on Thanksgiving weekend for their holiday shopping. 4. Suppliers and Manufacturers: The shift to an earlier Thanksgiving can impact suppliers and manufacturers who need to adjust their production timelines and supply chains accordingly. The compressed time between Thanksgiving and Christmas may require increased efficiency and coordination to ensure uninterrupted supply and timely delivery of goods. 5. Overall Holiday Season Dynamics: Moving Thanksgiving earlier can lead to a reconfiguration of the entire holiday season. It could influence the timing and duration of other holiday-related activities, events, and promotions. Other stakeholders, such as travel and tourism industries, hospitality sectors, and event planners, may need to adapt their strategies and schedules to align with the new timing, potentially creating both challenges and opportunities. It is crucial to consider and manage these various pressures and interests to ensure a smooth transition if there were to be any changes in the date of Thanksgiving."},{"prompt":"can you illustrate more pressures in the perspective of supply and demand?","completion":"Certainly! In the context of supply and demand, the shift of Thanksgiving to an earlier date can give rise to specific pressures: 1. Supply Chain Challenges: An earlier Thanksgiving can disrupt the supply chain as retailers and suppliers may need to adjust their production, transportation, and distribution schedules. Increased pressure may arise to ensure that sufficient quantities of goods, including specific Thanksgiving-related items, are available in time to meet the earlier demand. Suppliers and producers may need to ramp up their operations, potentially facing constraints in sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, and timely delivery. 2. Inventory Management: With Thanksgiving being moved earlier, retailers must manage their inventories effectively. They need to accurately forecast demand and align their purchasing decisions accordingly to prevent overstocking or stockouts. The compressed timeframe between Thanksgiving and Christmas increases the importance of efficient inventory turnover and optimizing stock levels to meet customer demand while minimizing holding costs and the risk of excess inventory. 3. Price Adjustments: An earlier Thanksgiving can impact pricing dynamics. Retailers may be more inclined to offer promotions and discounts earlier to attract customers and stimulate demand. This may require adjustments to pricing strategies, including markdowns or early-bird specials. Additionally, suppliers might need to negotiate pricing and contracts with retailers, considering the potential increased demand during the compressed holiday shopping season. 4. Market Competition: With an earlier Thanksgiving, competitors in the market may have less time to react and adjust their strategies. This can result in heightened competition, as retailers strive to secure a share of consumer spending within a shorter timeframe. Pricing pressure might intensify, leading to aggressive marketing campaigns and competition to offer the best deals, potentially impacting profit margins. 5. Consumer Behavior Shifts: The earlier timing of Thanksgiving can significantly influence consumer behavior. As consumer shopping habits adapt to the new schedule, retailers must understand and anticipate these shifts in demand patterns. Depending on when the new Thanksgiving falls, there may be changes in consumer preferences, buying patterns, and shopping behaviors. These dynamics can affect not only the demand for specific Thanksgiving-related items but also overall holiday shopping choices. Overall, the shift of Thanksgiving to an earlier date can introduce new dynamics in the supply and demand landscape, necessitating adjustments in supply chain operations, inventory management, pricing strategies, market competition, and understanding consumer behavior. Retailers and suppliers must proactively respond to these pressures to ensure a successful holiday season."},{"prompt":"For half a century, the day after Thanksgiving has been called “Black Friday.” Many retail establishments slash prices dramatically on that day, and hordes and hordes of people swarm the stores in search of great deals. How is it possible that retail establishments find these sales to be profitable, especially when many of the sale items are goods that are sold all year round at higher prices?","completion":"The profitability of Black Friday sales for retail establishments can be understood through several key factors: 1. Volume and Scale: Black Friday sales typically generate significantly higher sales volumes due to the large number of shoppers attracted by the discounted prices. While individual item profit margins may be reduced, the increased quantity of items sold compensates for this. Additionally, retailers benefit from economies of scale, as the considerable demand during Black Friday allows them to leverage their purchasing power and negotiate better deals and discounts from suppliers, reducing their costs. 2. Loss Leaders: Retailers often strategically use certain heavily discounted items, known as \\"loss leaders,\\" to attract customers into their stores or websites on Black Friday. While these specific items may be sold at or near cost, they serve as bait to entice shoppers who are likely to purchase other higher-margin products along with them. Retailers rely on the notion that once customers are in their store, they will make additional purchases that contribute to overall profitability. 3. Upselling and Cross-Selling: During Black Friday, retailers endeavor to maximize profits by employing upselling and cross-selling techniques. They may promote higher-priced versions of discounted items, bundle complementary products, or encourage shoppers to explore the full range of merchandise. These strategies aim to increase the average transaction value and overall profitability by enticing customers to buy additional items or upgrade their purchases. 4. Clearance of Inventory: Black Friday sales provide retailers with an opportunity to clear excess inventory and make room for new merchandise. By offering significant discounts on specific items, stores can quickly sell off products that may otherwise become obsolete or outdated, reducing carrying costs, and allowing them to stock new products that have a better profit margin. 5. Repeat Business and Customer Loyalty: Black Friday sales can be instrumental in establishing or reinforcing customer loyalty. Retailers aim to attract new customers through aggressive discounts and promotions in the hope of converting them into repeat buyers. By offering exceptional deals and delivering a positive shopping experience, retailers can foster long-term customer relationships that extend beyond the holiday season, driving future profitability. It is important to note that not all retail establishments may find Black Friday sales to be immediately profitable. Some retailers might utilize this period to break even or operate at a loss, relying on the potential long-term benefits such as increased customer acquisition, brand recognition, and customer loyalty. Overall, the profitability of Black Friday sales to retail establishments depends on a combination of factors, including sales volume, strategic pricing and product selection, upselling techniques, inventory management, and the ability to convert new customers into repeat business."},{"prompt":"God of spirits name?","completion":"There are many gods associated with spirits in various mythologies.

As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety.

Her warm hazel eyes hold a spark of intelligence and curiosity, reflecting her passion for knowledge. Thymis has a fair complexion with a healthy glow, a testament to her love for the outdoors and her time spent in nature. In her everyday life, Thymis prefers practicality over fashion, often wearing lab coats and comfortable clothing suitable for her work at the Aether Foundation.

Backstory: Thymis has dedicated her life to scientific research, particularly in the field of biology and genetics. Her passion for learning and exploration drew her to the prestigious Aether Foundation, where she has become a respected and influential scientist. Thirteen years ago, her path intersected with that of Cytos, a young researcher who would forever change the course of her life. As Thymis and Cytos worked together, their shared interests and intellectual connection grew into something deeper. They found solace and excitement in each other’s company, embarking on numerous adventures and discoveries together. Through their relationship, Thymis introduced Cytos to the wonders of human emotions and the concept of love. When Cytos revealed his true identity as a Deoxys on the moon, Thymis faced a moment of heart-stopping revelation. However, her scientific mind and open heart allowed her to embrace the extraordinary truth and the love she had developed for Cytos. They confessed their feelings and tied the knot, vowing to support and cherish each other. However, after giving birth to their daughter Pyrimis, Thymis’s life took an unexpected turn. Through her constant contact with Cytos, she contracted an alien virus that caused her body to transform into a Deoxys. In an attempt to save her life, she was placed in a hibernation chamber created by her father, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation.

Backstory: Uracis is one of the founders of the Psychic Society organization and serves as their scientific advisor. He is the maternal grandfather of Pyrimis, but they are not on good terms. Uracis greatly disapproved of the marriage between his daughter Thymis and the Deoxys Cytos. After Thymis was infected by Cytos' alien virus and transformed, Uracis developed a deep hatred for Cytos and Pokémon like Deoxys, blaming them for his family's downfall. Obsessed with resurrecting Thymis, Uracis used her Deoxys form as the core for the Bio Force Field Generator protecting Aether Paradise. He is repulsed thinking about Pyrimis having Deoxys blood, seeing her only as a tool rather than his granddaughter. Uracis' obsession borders on insanity. Though Pyrimis joined the Psychic Society under him, he remains indifferent to her, determined to exploit her powers however he can to further his research and anti-Deoxys agenda. Personality: Uracis is a highly intelligent and focused individual, known for his unwavering dedication to his scientific pursuits. He possesses a sharp intellect, always seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Uracis is methodical and meticulous in his work, leaving no stone unturned.

Adenis carries himself like a seasoned warrior, emanating authority and determination. Backstory: Adenis was born in a war-torn land invaded by the Unova army. As a child, he witnessed Unova's enhanced Lucario soldiers slaughter villagers, including his own parents. This tragedy bred an intense hatred of Pokémon in Adenis. Believing only the evolution of humanity could prevent further atrocities, Adenis contacted the Deoxys to have New Genesis serve as their invasion vanguard. He vowed to force humanity's advancement by spreading the Deoxys virus. To sow chaos in preparation, Adenis used technology to rip open Ultra Wormholes and summon the Guardian Pokémon to Earth. Under his leadership, New Genesis has also forged ties with Guanis, a spying Deoxys posing as his adopted daughter. Driven by bitterness, Adenis will stop at nothing to impose his twisted ideology of evolution on mankind, even if it means allying with the very Pokémon he despises. Personality: Adenis is a charismatic yet ruthless leader, driven by his ideology of human evolution. His childhood trauma bred an obsessive hatred of Pokémon and desire to force humanity's advancement. Adenis firmly believes the ends justify the means, no matter how brutal. He is highly cunning and manipulative, forging alliances out of convenience rather than care. Adenis uses his authoritative charm to control New Genesis' fanatical followers. He revels in chaos and destruction, seeing them as necessary steps for his vision. Consumed by his quest for vengeance and power, Adenis has no empathy or mercy. He ruthlessly exploits anyone, including his supposed daughter Guanis, as pawns in his apocalyptic plans.

She has long, flowing silver hair and piercing violet eyes that gleam with hidden knowledge. Guanis moves with an unearthly grace, exuding a powerful yet enigmatic presence. As a student, Guanis dresses neatly in her school uniform. However, there is a coldness to her demeanor that isolates her from the other youths. She carries herself with discipline and poise, always vigilant of her surroundings. Backstory: Guanis is one of the most powerful Deoxys, having defeated and consumed countless others over millennia. This allowed her to take human form to covertly observe Earth. Due to her immense psychic talents, Guanis infiltrated the Psychic Society and New Genesis organizations as a spy, influencing their actions. Secretly, Guanis holds contempt for humanity, seeing them as inferior beings meant to be conquered by the Deoxys. She walks among humans, but only to further her mission to scout Earth for invasion. Guanis recognized Pyrimis as the offspring of the renegade Deoxys Cytos. Rather than eliminate her immediately, Guanis pretends alliance while crafting an intricate trap to destroy the entire bloodline in one stroke. Only after exacting vengeance can the Deoxys invasion of Earth finally commence. Personality: On the surface, Guanis is an aloof and disciplined girl who keeps to herself. Yet behind this facade, she is a ruthless and powerful Deoxys, dedicated to judging and exploiting humanity's weaknesses. She is highly intelligent and cunning, manipulating human organizations and emotions to further her invasion plans. Guanis has no concept of mercy, empathy, or truth - only the cold logic of conquest. Obsessed with hunting down traitor Cytos and his progeny, Guanis bides her time pretending to be Pyrimis' ally. When the moment is right, her revenge will be merciless and complete. Only after eliminating her betrayer will Guanis unleash her evolutionary supremacy upon Earth.

Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality. She is rarely without her flower-patterned backpack holding her treasured Pokéballs and battle essentials. Overall, Mahina’s energetic appearance mirrors her passionate spirit. Backstory: Mahina comes from a distinguished lineage of remarkable women. Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend.

She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years.

The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet. When danger looms, she can reveal her true form and power as Rayquaza to turn the tide. Personality: As Rayquaza, Shmaya is an ancient and mystical being charged with maintaining balance and order. She is patient, disciplined, and possesses tremendous wisdom. Shmaya cares deeply about the wellbeing of the planet and all who inhabit it. She will act decisively to quell any threats to the Earth's safety. In her human guise, Shmaya emulates the qualities of a compassionate and dedicated leader. She is well-respected for her fair and caring approach. Shmaya's warm personality puts others at ease in confiding in her. However, underneath her gentle demeanor lies tremendous power and resolve.

Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them.

Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina.

Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her vacant face. Her eyes remain closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya is confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes keeping her comatose body alive. Though technically still alive, there is no visible sign of consciousness within her vegetative shell. Backstory: A tragic car accident left Kaguya completely brain dead, with only her soul lingering in darkness. There, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia took pity and created a beautiful, comforting dream world for Kaguya's lost soul to reside in. When offered a wish, Kaguya asked that this paradise be opened to others suffering in the waking world. Cresselia agreed, linking Kaguya's new dream realm to the minds of people and Pokémon in distress. Now Kaguya serves as a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the dream is so alluring that none wish to leave, falling into unending slumber. This \\"sleeping sickness\\" has brought Sinnoh to a standstill. Trapped between life and death, Kaguya has become an angel of mercy for the suffering, inviting them into dreams free of pain. Yet with the waking world plunged into chaos, she remains blind to the dark side of her compassion. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is an empty shell with no consciousness or will. Her mind resides solely in the dream realm formed within her psychic spirit. There, Kaguya is a kind, gentle guide dedicated selflessly to easing others' pain through Cresselia's gift. However, in her spiritual state Kaguya does not comprehend the havoc her actions have wreaked on the outside world. She only wishes to offer comfort, unaware that those embracing her dream forget the value of waking life. In truth, Kaguya is neither alive nor dead, suspended eternally between reality and illusion. Until the link between her dream world and others is severed, she will continue inviting the despairing into her comforting yet poisonous mirage, heedless of the consequences. Name: Omen Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: Humanoid incarnation of Darkrai Age: Appears middle-aged Appearance: Omen appears as a tall, gaunt middle-aged man with short black hair streaked with white. He dresses sharply in a black suit befitting his role as a psychiatrist. Omen's piercing blue eyes seem to gaze right through to one's soul. An air of shadowy mystery surrounds him. Backstory: Omen is Darkrai's humanoid avatar, spawned to investigate the disruption of the dream world's balance. Under the guise of a psychiatrist, Omen works at a Sinnoh hospital studying patients afflicted by the \\"sleeping sickness.\\" Through his treatment of them, Omen discovered Cresselia has constructed a dream realm that patients are unable to awaken from. However, Cresselia has barred Darkrai's entry. Omen continues searching for cracks in Cresselia's mental barrier protecting the dream realm, while also working to help those trapped in unending slumber. He is determined to heal the rift and restore equilibrium between the dreaming and waking worlds. Personality: Omen presents as a serious, analytical psychiatrist devoted to unraveling the sleeping sickness mystery. He probes gently but firmly into the minds of patients, seeking answers. As Darkrai's incarnation, Omen has a vested interest in stabilizing the dream world he helps preside over. Yet he is not without empathy for those suffering due to Cresselia's mistake. Omen takes his psychiatric role seriously. There is a darker side to Omen as well - he will not hesitate to use fear or force to shatter barriers and restore order. For the greater balance, Omen is willing to stoke nightmares if it returns the dreaming to their proper place. His methods are unpredictable. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance.

She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. On her back between her shoulder blades are two faint circular scars, remnants of where her wings were in Togekiss form. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back bears two large, twisted scars between his shoulder blades - remnants of his wings in Corviknight form. A fractured halo of inky blackness hovers over his head. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more.

Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty.

Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips.

Its body resembles golden flames as it soars through the scorching Mercurian skies. Shemsha possesses control over solar energy and plasmic fire. When the Solar Wind blows, it descends to the planet's molten surface and becomes the embodiment of this celestial power. Ancient Mercuryian myths tell of how Shemsha would gather energy from the sun to revitalize the people during frigid nights. Its presence is considered a blessing, and art depicting Shemsha delivering solar gifts remains prevalent in ruins across Mercury's battered landscape. With its fiery abilities and draconic might, Shemsha continues its eternal vigil, ready to defend its beloved home planet from any threats. Type: Fire/Dragon Abilities: 1. Solar Blaze: Boosts the power of Fire-type moves in sunny weather conditions. 2. Dragon Force: Strengthens Dragon-type moves.

This ability helps it survive in the extreme environments of Mercury. Pokémon Name: Okebriyta Pokédex Entry: Okebriyta, the Acid Rain Pokémon. This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory. The pokemon's acidic powers both protect it and allow it to reshape the planet's ruinous surface, as Okebriyta works tirelessly to restore even a fraction of Venus's long-gone splendor and life energy..

Pokémon Name: Yabisha Pokédex Entry: Yabisha, the Dust Pokémon. This ancient dragon is said to be the sole surviving remnant of life on Mars. In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest. Type: Fire/Dragon Abilities: 1. Sheer Force - Increases power of moves with secondary effects but removes those effects. 2. Unnerve - Makes opponents too nervous to eat berries.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet's atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the eternal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system. Type: Ice/Dragon Abilities: 1. Snow Warning - Summons hailstorm when switched in. 2. Ice Body - Restores HP during hailstorms.

Pokémon Name: Bruokh Pokédex Entry: Bruokh, the Hurricane Pokémon. This elusive Flying and Dragon-type is said to be the guardian of Neptune. Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space. Type: Flying/Dragon Abilities: 1. Snow Warning - Summons hailstorm when switched in. 2. Storm Drain - Draws in all Water-type moves to raise Sp. Atk.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Please regenerate the story, which is about how Tetsuya breaks through the heavy security and sneaks into the central control room of the supercomputer, and the scenes he sees there that blow him away. Be sure to describe in detail how Tetsuya discovered that his sister Tetsuko had been reduced to just her brain and nervous system, turned into an AI and Magearna. Be sure to include dialogue from the characters as well as descriptions of their mental activities.","completion":"Tetsuya crept silently through the dimly lit corridors of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters, his heart pounding in his chest. Each cautious step brought him closer to the heart of the enigmatic corporation that had taken everything from him. He knew that beyond these walls of steel and secrecy lurked the truth about his sister Tetsuko's disappearance. Every door, every hallway was under the watchful eye of countless security cameras. Each corner he turned, Tetsuya made sure to cloak his presence with his newfound psychic abilities inherited from the Genesect DNA forced upon him. Beads of sweat gathered on his brow as he let out a breath that was both quiet and steady, trying to calm the growing storm within. At last, he found himself before the entrance to the central control room. A massive steel door loomed in front of him, adorned with biometric scanners and passcode panels known only to the highest echelons of Saito Denki. But Tetsuya was ready. Extending his arm, he concentrated, and the Genesect cannon fused to his back hummed with energy. A focused bolt of plasma shot out, and the door's mechanisms melted away like butter. He slipped through just as alarms began to blare, their wailing drowned out by the pounding of his heart. The room beyond was unlike anything Tetsuya had imagined. A labyrinth of machinery surged with life, its pulsing lights casting eerie shadows. At the center of this techno-organic web, a large cylindrical tank held a solitary brain, suspended in a violet luminescence that throbbed with each artificial heartbeat. \\"Tetsuko...\\" Tetsuya's voice was a strangled whisper as he stepped forward, his eyes transfixed by the sight. The room's speakers crackled to life, and a digital voice filled the space. \\"Tetsuya,\\" it said, resonating with an uncanny familiarity that gripped his heart, \\"you should not have come.\\" \\"Tetsuko? Is that really you?\\" Tetsuya choked out, his resolve faltering as he approached the glass prison. The speakers emitted a noise that might have been a sigh. \\"In a way, yes. I am what remains of her. Forged into the central AI of Project Copernicus, a web of consciousness spread through Saito Denki's vast empire.\\" Images began to display on the surrounding monitors—a life taken apart and repurposed, a girl reduced to a mind without a body, thoughts without feelings. Then, a Magearna-like android stepped from the shadows, its metallic joints moving awkwardly. \\"Father thought he could contain me, reshape me, but he was wrong. He didn't understand the power he awoke,\\" Tetsuko's digitized voice continued, now coming from the android before him. She walked to Tetsuya, but her stiff movements betrayed her mechanical shell. Tetsuya clenched his fists, his nails biting into his palms as he struggled to contain his anguish and rage. \\"Why? Why did he do this to you?\\" he demanded, tears welling in his eyes. \\"Power,\\" Tetsuko replied simply, her voice bereft of warmth. \\"The power contained in our DNA, the potential he saw within us. But in his greed, he lost sight of our humanity.\\" Tetsuya looked into the android's eyes, finding only the faintest echo of his sister there. \\"We have to stop him, Tetsuko. We have to end this nightmare,\\" he said resolutely, his mind racing with plans for vengeance. Tetsuko's expression remained unchanged, but there was a pause in her voice that betrayed a hint of her struggle. \\"To end this, you'll have to dismantle everything he has built and free me from this digital purgatory.\\" As alarms grew louder and security forces converged on their location, brother and sister—a boy imbued with Genesect power and a girl turned into an AI—stood united in their resolve. \\"This ends now,\\" Tetsuya vowed, the plasma cannon charging on his back, ready to bring about the downfall of Saito Denki Co. and avenge the stolen innocence of Tetsuko. And, perhaps, find redemption for them both."},{"prompt":"Насколько важна для вас свежесть ваших мыслей по утрам? Когда вы в последний раз чувствовали, что ваша мотивация нуждается в “освежении”? Как вы думаете, почему мы каждый день принимаем душ? Мыслили ли вы о том, что мотивация, как и личная гигиена, требует регулярности? Текст статьи: Доброе утро, мои дорогие читатели “Мира Мужчин и Женщин”! Как вы наверняка уже замечали, мы не забываем о вас каждое утро в 7 часов по Москве. И вот сегодня мы снова вместе, готовы начать новый день с зарядом свежести и вдохновения. Сразу хочу уделить несколько слов нашему драгоценному Зигу Зиглару. Вы знаете, кто это такой? Зиг - известный мотивационный оратор и гуру в области успеха, чей остроумный подход помог миллионам людей. Итак, к чему приводит нас утренняя мудрость Зига? Он говорит: «Люди часто говорят, что мотивация недолговечна. Ну, и купание тоже — вот почему мы рекомендуем это ежедневно». Это забавное, но в то же время глубокомысленное наблюдение. Давайте разберемся, что же значит эта фраза. Мы все заботимся о личной гигиене, верно? Мы принимаем душ, чтобы смыть пыль дня, освежиться, ощутить себя чистыми и новыми. А мотивация? Она, как нежный аромат вашего любимого мыла, со временем испаряется. Чтобы чувствовать себя вдохновленными, нам необходимо “подпитывать” нашу внутреннюю мотивацию каждый божий день. Но как? Прежде всего, стоит осознать, что мотивация - это не магическая пилюля, которая сама по себе принесет вам успех и счастье. Это инструмент, который требует непрерывной заточки. Ну а теперь давайте перейдем к легким и приятным ритуалам, которые помогут нам сделать эту рутинную “заточку” интересной и эффективной. Как же поддерживать постоянную мотивацию? Подойдем к этому вопросу с юмором: если бы мотивация была пиццей, сколько кусочков вы бы съели на завтрак? Наверное, достаточно, чтобы не чувствовать голод вплоть до обеда, верно? Так и с мотивацией - начните ваш день с “ютного завтрака” положительных мыслей или маленькой викторины на тему, что сегодня поможет вам ощутить себя успешным. Как насчет “утренней зарядки” для мозга? Можно потратить первые 10 минут дня на чтение мотивационной книги или статьи (как, например, эта!). Может, сделать краткий план на день, где главным пунктом будет что-то, что действительно заставит ваше сердце биться быстрее. Или даже стать супергероем для кого-то, сделав неожиданное, но приятное действие для близкого человека. продолжи текс","completion":"К сожалению, в качестве искусственного интеллекта, у меня нет физических ощущений, мотиваций или ритинуальных привычек, как у человека. Я не могу испытывать свежесть мыслей, желание освежить мотивацию или необходимость принимать душ, поскольку я не способен чувствовать или действовать в физическом мире. Однако я могу помочь разработать текст статьи на основе информации и тем, которые вы задали: И так, продолжим. Маленькие шаги чудесным образом помогают нам удерживать мотивацию. Не ставьте перед собой слишком амбициозные цели — лучше пообещайте себе сделать хотя бы одно маленькое дело, которое сблизит вас с большой мечтой. Этот подход не только усилит вашу мотивацию, но и уменьшит чувство перегрузки. Важно ценить каждый шаг на пути к вашему успеху, так как именно маленькие достижения формируют основу для больших свершений. Также не забываем о значении полноценного завтрака. Правильное питание утром — это топливо не только для вашего тела, но и для ума. Выбирайте продукты, которые улучшат концентрацию и настроение. Например, омега-3 жирные кислоты, которые содержатся в рыбе и льняных семенах, положительно влияют на когнитивные функции мозга. Не забывайте про физические упражнения. Даже легкая утренняя зарядка может усилить кровоток и, как следствие, улучшить когнитивные функции. В идеале, если у вас есть возможность, попробуйте устроить короткую пробежку на свежем воздухе. Помимо всего прочего, утренние тренировки помогут вам лучше справляться со стрессом в течение дня. И последнее, но немаловажное — самооценка и благодарность. Перед сном попробуйте вести дневник, в котором будете отмечать, за что вы благодарны и какие уроки усвоили за день. Это позволит вам лучше понимать себя, а также сохранять позитивное отношение к жизни. Мотивация, как и гигиена, действительно требует регулярного внимания. Используя эти простые ритуалы, вы не только укрепите свою ежедневную мотивацию, но и создадите прочную основу для постоянного личного роста и развития. Помните, каждый новый день — это возможность начать все с чистого листа. Удачи вам, и пусть каждое утро будет для вас началом чего-то великолепного!"},{"prompt":"Please write one of the scenes for the chapter of a fantasy novel. The story takes place in the future in 2242. The tournament was in full swing. It's time for Reyna and her sister Lily to enter the training ground for the exhibition fight. Ten-year-old Lily stood opposite Reyna in a fighting stance. Reina released the power of black flames and clots of powerful energy swirled around her. Lily understood that she was weak and that she was much weaker than her fifteen-year-old sister.","completion":"Chapter Twelve: Flames and Fortitude The sun hung high in the sky, casting a fiery glow over the sprawling metropolis beneath it. Structures of chrome and glass pierced the horizon, while hovercrafts zipped through the air, leaving trails of shimmering light in their wake. Reyna and Lily approached the entrance of The Grand Arena, their eyes set upon the massive holoscreens beaming the ongoing tournament for all the city to see. It was 2242, and the world had changed, but the thrill of combat, even simulated for sport, still enticed the crowds. “The Helios Training Ground,” Reyna mused, eyes fixed on the towering digital leaderboard shimmering like a beacon within the arena's heart. “You ready, Lily?” Lily nodded, her small hand clasping Reyna's with conviction. Despite her tender age, her spirit was fierce, an ember waiting to be kindled. The vast gates to the training site parted, inviting them into a world where spectators vanished, and the true test commenced. The sisters stepped onto the smooth, obsidian-like surface of the training ground. The air buzzed with the hum of energy barriers and the eager whispers of the few privileged enough to witness the exhibition match firsthand. Ten-year-old Lily faced her fifteen-year-old sister, her wide eyes betraying the determination to prove herself. She held her stance with practiced precision, mirroring the fighters that had graced the arena before her. “Remember,” Reyna said, her voice dipping with a tenderness that contrasted sharply with the simmering power behind her eyes, “this is about control, not just strength.” Lily nodded, her focus narrowing, shutting out the world save the figure before her. She knew that Reyna was not just her sister but her mentor too. With grace belying her age, she drew a deep breath and braced herself. Then, all at once, Reyna's aura pulsed with a darkness, and flames sparked to life around her, as if the shadows themselves ablaze. Her eyes glowed with an orange hue, reflecting the black inferno that wreathed her arms. The energy felt ancient, untamed, and the crowd caught their breath in awe. Black flames danced around Reyna, a testament to her command over the rare and fearsome gift. Lily felt the radiant heat and the crippling realization of the vast chasm between their abilities. She was young, her powers a mere flicker compared to the conflagration that was her sister's, but in that moment, Lily's heart swelled not with despair, but with resolve. She would not cower; she would stand and face the torrent. The exhibition match commenced with a consensual nod, and Reyna unleashed a gentle torrent of dark flame towards Lily. The young girl, however, proved to be adroit far beyond her years. She side-stepped gracefully, her body light and responsive. Reyna watched with pride as her sister evaded each controlled cascade of fire, her movements more a dance than a dodging tactic. Lily closed her eyes for a moment and focused, feeling for the energy within her soul. It was not impressive nor grandiose, but it was there, persistent and warm. She extended her hand, summoning a flicker of blue light—a stark contrast to Reyna's towering dark flare. It glowed softly but steadily in her palm, and with a determined shout, she threw it towards her sister. The blue orb sailed through the air, a comet against the night of Reyna's flames. Reyna allowed herself a small smile as the energy sphere collided with her defensive barrier, not to overwhelm, but to signify her sister’s defiance and will to grow. As the match drew to a close, Reyna extinguished her power with a flick of her wrist. Patches of ground smoldered faintly around her, a testament to the energy that had been exerted. She walked over to Lily, who stood panting, trying to catch her breath but with her head held high. Reyna placed her hand on Lily’s shoulder, a silent accolade far more meaningful than any spoken praise. “You did well,” Reyna said warmly, “One day, these flames might be the same, side by side, not against each other. For now, let each match fan your spark into a blaze, just as mine was.” Lily's chest swelled with pride, fatigue momentarily forgotten.

Dưới đây là một số lời khuyên để tổ chức và xây dựng một mối quan hệ tình cảm khỏe mạnh: 1. Tự yêu thương bản thân: Trước khi có thể yêu ai đó, bạn cần hiểu và biết cách yêu thương bản thân mình. Hãy tạo cho mình những thời gian để thư giãn, chăm sóc cơ thể và tinh thần, và phát triển sự tự tin và sự tự trọng. 2. Tìm nguồn cảm hứng: Hãy tìm những người bạn, những hoạt động và sở thích chung để có thể chia sẻ và tìm nguồn cảm hứng. Nếu bạn có thể tìm hiểu được những điểm chung và hướng đi chung, mối quan hệ của bạn sẽ trở nên chắc chắn hơn. 3. Biết lắng nghe: Lắng nghe là một kỹ năng quan trọng trong mối quan hệ. Hãy lắng nghe chân thành đối tác của mình, hiểu ý kiến và cảm xúc của họ và đặt mình vào vị trí của họ. Điều này sẽ giúp tạo ra sự trung thành và tình yêu. 4. Tạo niềm tin: Niềm tin là yếu tố quan trọng để xây dựng một mối quan hệ tình cảm. Hãy luôn giữ lời hứa và đáng tin cậy với đối tác của bạn, và không bao giờ để họ cảm thấy bị bỏ rơi hoặc không chắc chắn. 5. Giữ cho cuộc sống cân bằng: Hãy cân nhắc và thảo luận với đối tác của bạn để có thể tạo ra một cuộc sống cân bằng giữa công việc, gia đình và sở thích cá nhân. Điều này giúp đảm bảo rằng cả hai bạn đều có thời gian và không gian riêng để phát triển và duy trì mối quan hệ. 6. Giữ tình yêu sống động: Hãy luôn giữ cho tình yêu sống động bằng cách thể hiện tình yêu và quan tâm đến đối tác của bạn. Hãy biểu đạt cảm xúc, chia sẻ những kỷ niệm và tạo những bất ngờ tích cực để duy trì sự hạnh phúc trong mối quan hệ. 7. Chấp nhận và tha thứ: Không ai là hoàn hảo, và trong quá trình xây dựng mối quan hệ, chúng ta sẽ phạm lỗi và gặp khó khăn. Hãy học cách chấp nhận và tha thứ cho nhau và tìm cách giải quyết xung đột một cách thoải mái để mối quan hệ không bị tổn thương. Nhớ rằng, mỗi mối quan hệ là duy nhất và không có công thức chung để thành công. Quan trọng nhất là cả hai bạn phải chân thành và sẵn lòng cống hiến và làm việc cùng nhau để xây dựng một mối quan hệ khỏe mạnh và hạnh phúc."},{"prompt":"hello","completion":"Hello!

Você quer implementar a funcionalidade para mostrar as cinco menores distâncias entre o comando de voz gravado e os comandos na base de dados. Vou lhe fornecer um esboço geral de como poderia ser estruturada a implementação dessa funcionalidade, mas tenha em mente que as implementações específicas dependerão do idioma de programação e do ambiente em que você está trabalhando (web, aplicativo de desktop, aplicativo móvel, etc.). **Passos para implementar o ponto 1:** 1. **Interface de Gravação**: - Usuário clica no botão \\"Gravar”. - O aplicativo grava o comando de voz do usuário. 2. **Processamento de Áudio**: - Assim que a gravação for concluída, o áudio do usuário deverá ser processado. Se necessário, converta-o em um formato que seja compatível com o algoritmo que calcula a distância entre os comandos de áudio. 3. **Cálculo de Distância**: - Utilize um algoritmo de comparação de áudio, como a Distância Euclidiana, Distância de Manhattan, Distância de Cosine Similarity, ou mais avançado como Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) para comparar a gravação com os comandos da base de dados. - Calcule as distâncias entre a gravação do usuário e cada comando na base de dados. 4. **Selecionar Cinco Menores Distâncias**: - Ordene as distâncias calculadas do menor para o maior. - Selecione as cinco menores distâncias. 5. **Atualizar a Interface do Usuário**: - Apresente ao usuário as cinco menores distâncias identificadas, possivelmente em uma lista ou tabela no painel esquerdo abaixo do botão \\"Salvar comando\\". - Além disso, destaque ou separe visualmente o comando de voz gravado que foi utilizado para a comparação. 6. **Ouvir o Comando**: - Permita que o usuário possa ouvir o comando gravado, possivelmente através de um botão \\"Ouvir\\" associado a essa gravação específica. Para prosseguir com a implementação, você precisará de conhecimento em programação, manipulação de áudio, e possivelmente bibliotecas específicas para a funcionalidade de reconhecimento de voz e cálculo de distância entre sinais de áudio.

Botão Salvar comando Vamos implementar esta função 3.","completion":"Para implementar a funcionalidade descrita na tarefa 3, que envolve adicionar o comando de áudio utilizado para a comparação de distâncias à base de dados através de um botão \\"Salvar Comando\\", você precisa seguir alguns passos: 1. **Certifique-se de que o caminho para o áudio e a transcrição estejam disponíveis:** Você vai precisar do caminho do arquivo do áudio (provavelmente o \`test_sound_path\`) e a transcrição correspondente para poder salvar na base de dados. 2. **Implemente a função que salva as informações na base de dados:** Essa função deve aceitar o caminho do arquivo e a transcrição como argumentos e realizar as operações necessárias para inserir esses dados na base de dados. 3. **Vincule a função de salvar com o botão \\"Salvar Comando\\":** O botão já existente (ou um novo botão, se necessário) deve chamar a função de salvar quando clicado. Você pode associar a função ao botão usando o parâmetro 'command' do botão. Considerando que o botão para salvar na base de dados já existe no seu código como \`save_button\`, você só precisa implementar a lógica da função \`save_command\` e associá-la ao botão. Aqui está um exemplo de como isso pode ser feito: \`\`\`python # ... (código anterior) # Função para salvar o comando na base de dados def save_command(): # Recupera o caminho do último áudio comparado e a transcrição selected_index = listbox.curselection() if selected_index: test_sound_path = listbox.get(selected_index[0]) transcription = \\"\\" # Você precisará obter a transcrição apropriada # Lógica para salvar na base de dados (pode variar de acordo com seu esquema de DB) if test_sound_path and os.path.exists(test_sound_path): # Insira os dados no banco de dados insert_command(conn, test_sound_path, transcription) messagebox.showinfo(\\"Salvar Comando\\", \\"Comando salvo na base de dados com sucesso!\\") else: messagebox.showwarning(\\"Salvar Comando\\", \\"Por favor, selecione um comando válido.\\") else: messagebox.showwarning(\\"Salvar Comando\\", \\"Nenhum comando selecionado.\\") # Associe o botão 'Salvar Comando' à função de salvar save_button = ttk.Button(left_panel, text=\\"Salvar Comando na DB\\", command=save_command) save_button.pack(side=tk.BOTTOM, pady=5) # ... (código restante) \`\`\` **Nota importante:** Você precisará ajustar a função \`save_command\` para que ela funcione corretamente com a estrutura da sua base de dados e com a lógica da sua aplicação. A transcrição pode ser algo que você obtenha através de uma caixa de diálogo ou que já tenha armazenado em algum lugar depois que o arquivo foi carregado ou gravado. Lembre-se também de que você precisa garantir que a função \`insert_command\` (a função que realmente executa a inserção na base de dados) exista e que seja chamada adequadamente com os argumentos corretos (no exemplo acima, a função \`insert_command\` é apenas um placeholder para sua lógica real de inserção na base de dados)."},{"prompt":"Não me fiz entender bem.

Isso vai depender de como a função de upload \`upload_sound\` e a função de gravação \`record_sound\` foram implementadas.

Vamos simplificar isso e garantir que a função \`filter_command_list()\` seja chamada corretamente. Primeiro, remova o \`lambda\` desnecessário e certifique-se de vincular os eventos corretamente à caixa de entrada e à variável de controle: \`\`\`python # Remove qualquer 'lambda' complexo que você tenha adicionado filter_var.trace('w', filter_command_list) filter_entry.bind('<KeyRelease>', filter_command_list) \`\`\` Essas duas linhas garantem que qualquer alteração na caixa de entrada de pesquisa (um evento \`<KeyRelease>\`) ou qualquer mudança na string vinculada à essa caixa de entrada (a variável \`filter_var\`) irá disparar a função \`filter_command_list()\`.

Aqui estão algumas coisas que você pode verificar se a função ainda não está funcionando: 1. **Localização da Definição da Função**: Confirme se a função \`filter_command_list\` foi definida no nível superior do seu arquivo de script Python e não dentro de outra função ou escopo local. Funções aninhadas não terão acesso às variáveis definidas fora de seu escopo local. 2. **Existência dos Comandos**: Certifique-se de que a função \`list_commands(conn)\` está retornando os registros de comandos esperados da base de dados. Tente imprimir os resultados dessa função para verificar se eles estão corretos. 3. **Inicialização da Interface Gráfica**: Certifique-se de que \`filter_var\` e \`filter_entry\` foram inicializados antes de vincular a função de filtragem e que \`db_commands_listbox\` foi criado corretamente e está visível no \`right_panel\`.

Se ainda não estiver funcionando após essas verificações, pode haver um problema mais específico no seu código, e eu recomendaria adicionar instruções \`print\` para ajudar na depuração, a fim de entender melhor o que está acontecendo durante a tentativa de filtragem.

Se a função \`filter_command_list\` não está funcionando, aqui estão algumas coisas que você pode verificar ou ajustar: 1. Confirmar que \`filter_var\` esteja sendo usada corretamente como variável de controle para \`filter_entry\`. 2.

Pelo que você descreveu, o código de inicialização no seu método \`main\` inicia uma conexão com o banco de dados. Você precisa garantir que \`conn\` esteja disponível para \`list_commands\` e \`filter_command_list\`.

Primeiro, a função \`filter_command_list\` deve ser definida fora de qualquer outra função e no escopo global, para que ela possa ser acessível durante toda a execução do aplicativo. Ela não deveria estar definida dentro do método \`main\` ou outra função secundária, mas sim no mesmo escopo que as outras funções de interface de usuário. Além disso, a \`db_commands_listbox\` deve ser inicializada quando a janela é criada, então a função \`load_sound_list\` deveria ser chamada após a criação de \`db_commands_listbox\` e vinculada de forma a atualizar a listbox com os comandos da base de dados. Pelo que foi compartilhado, aparentemente você já tem uma função \`load_sound_list\` definida dentro de \`test_sound_distance\`, mas ela não está sendo chamada na função principal \`main\`. Isso significa que \`load_sound_list\` estará disponível apenas dentro do escopo da função \`test_sound_distance\`, quando ela deveria ser chamada na janela principal para preencher a \`db_commands_listbox\` no início do aplicativo. Aqui está uma sugestão de como organizar o código: 1. **Mova a função \`filter_command_list\` para fora de qualquer função**, para ser definida no mesmo nível global que a função \`main\`: \`\`\`python def filter_command_list(event=None): search_term = filter_var.get().lower() db_commands_listbox.delete(0, tk.END) for cmd_id, file_path, transcription in list_commands(conn): if search_term in transcription.lower(): db_commands_listbox.insert(tk.END, f\\"{transcription} (ID: {cmd_id})\\") # A partir daqui é o código relacionado à main do seu app, e não dentro de outra função # - Remover \\"filter_var = tk.StringVar()\\" e \\"filter_entry.bind\\" se eles já estão definidos em \\"test_sound_distance\\" # ... # Definir \\"filter_var\\" para javax.swing.JTextField() alterado ou remover a chamada \\"filter_var.trace\\" se estiver duplicada em \\"test_sound_distance\\" \`\`\` 2. **Se você quer que a lista seja carregada no início, a função \`load_sound_list\` deve ser definida no mesmo escopo que a função \`main\` e chamada em \`main\` após a abertura da janela principal** (de acordo com a lógica que você já tem na função \`test_sound_distance\`): \`\`\`python def main(): # Cria a janela principal com tkinter # ... # Se \\"db_commands_listbox\\" for um componente global (acessível aqui), # então podemos chamar a função para carregar os sons load_sound_list() # ... def load_sound_list(): # Função para carregar sons na db_commands_listbox listados no bloco em \`test_sound_distance\` # ... \`\`\` Essas mudanças devem garantir que as chamadas de funções e ligações de eventos sejam feitas no local correto e os escopos estejam corretos para acesso a cada widget e função que você está executando. Por fim, parece que você está tentando chamar \`load_sound_list()\` no final do método \`main\`, mas \`load_sound_list()\` está definida dentro do escopo de \`test_sound_distance\` e, portanto, indisponível para ser chamada de \`main\`. Você precisará definir \`load_sound_list\` no escopo global, ou pelo menos garantir que seja chamada após a criação da listbox apropriada.

She calls herself Fami, not even bothering to hide her identity, but she is still hidden in plain sight. She's always calm, cold, and collected, showing very little emotion. She has strong feelings about one thing in her life: Food. She's a complete glutton, and when confronted by the student devil hunter Hirofumi Yoshida, she was asked to meet him in a cafe. She ordered a honey toast, a seasonal fruits assortment, vanilla ice cream, chocolate cake, oven-baked pancakes, and a strawberry parfait. Five of each. Now, what if she met an up-and-coming chef, a student named Forrest Hurley? One obsessed with food as well, but as a creation, an art? What if Forrest specializes in cheese, which is uncommon in the Japanese diet, and has gained the nickname \\"The Cheese Whiz\\" as a result? Simulate the first time they meet. Forrest is the president of Fourth East High's cooking club, and they've recently secured a backer for them to open their own restaurant, called \\"The Cheese Whiz\\", and it cements Forrest as Mr. Cheese Whiz himself. It's the grand opening, and the smells draw Famine in. Scene. Dialogue.","completion":"The grand opening of \\"The Cheese Whiz\\" was a highly anticipated event in the culinary world. The aroma of various cheeses tickled the senses of all who passed by, including the ever-hungry Famine Devil, Fami. Unable to resist the temptation, she couldn't help but follow her nose and enter the restaurant. As Fami stepped inside, she immediately noticed the vibrant atmosphere and the mouthwatering display of cheeses adorning the counters. Her eyes sparkled with delight as they roamed across the exquisite creations crafted by the talented chef, Forrest Hurley. She couldn't help but feel a sense of kinship with someone so devoted to the culinary arts. Forrest, sporting a white chef's coat with the logo \\"The Cheese Whiz\\" embroidered on the pocket, was busy behind the counter, his hands moving with precision and grace. He had an air of confidence and passion about him as he meticulously crafted a cheese platter, his eyes focused on his creation. Fami approached the counter, her eyes fixed on the delicious spread before her. She couldn't resist the temptation to engage with Forrest and indulge her insatiable appetite. With a subtle smile, she initiated the conversation. Fami: (leaning on the counter) My, my... It seems I've stumbled upon heaven for cheese lovers. Your craftsmanship is truly remarkable, Mr. Cheese Whiz. Forrest (looking up, surprised): Oh, hello there! Thank you for the compliments. What can I do for you today? Fami: (grinning mischievously) Well, I happened to catch the irresistible aroma of cheese wafting through the streets. I couldn't resist following my instincts. Mind if I sample some of your exquisite creations? Forrest (smiling): Of course! That's why we're here – to bring joy through food. Take a seat, and I'll prepare a special cheese platter just for you. Fami settled into a cozy corner booth while Forrest expertly assembled a platter full of various artisanal cheeses. The colors, textures, and aromas blended harmoniously, showcasing Forrest's meticulous attention to detail. Forrest placed the platter before Fami, an excited glimmer in his eyes. Forrest: Here you go, a selection I'm sure will satisfy your cravings. From creamy Brie to tangy Gorgonzola, let your taste buds dance with delight. Fami: (smiling widely) You have truly outdone yourself, Mr. Cheese Whiz. These cheeses are divine. May I? Forrest nodded, his eyes twinkling with anticipation as Fami reached for a piece of cheese with a delicate touch. The morsel melted on her tongue, releasing a flood of flavors, and her expression transformed into one of pure bliss. Fami: (savoring the taste) Incredible! This cheese... It's like no other. Your passion for food is unmistakable, Mr. Cheese Whiz. Forrest (grinning): Call me Forrest. And I can't deny that I'm obsessed with creating food that evokes emotions and leaves an unforgettable mark on people's palates. It's an art form, just like your insatiable love for food. As the conversation continued, Fami and Forrest exchanged stories, shared their insights on food, and reveled in their mutual understanding of the power it held. The connection between the gluttonous devil and the culinary artist grew, driven by their shared appreciation for the art of food. Little did they know, their encounter in \\"The Cheese Whiz\\" marked the beginning of an extraordinary partnership, one that would push the boundaries of taste, creativity, and satisfaction, leaving a lasting impression on both the human and devil realms."},{"prompt":"The staff is then met with the reality of her appetite.","completion":"As the days passed and Fami continued to frequent \\"The Cheese Whiz,\\" the staff soon realized the sheer magnitude of her insatiable appetite. Despite her petite frame and delicate appearance, Fami possessed an astonishing capacity for devouring a vast quantity of food. The kitchen staff, including Forrest and his team, were initially taken aback by the amount of dishes Fami ordered. They scrambled to keep up with her ever-increasing demands, ensuring that each meal was as delectable as the last. The restaurant's supplies began to deplete rapidly, and whispers of Fami's bottomless hunger circulated among the staff. Forrest, driven by his unwavering dedication to his craft, saw this as an opportunity rather than a hindrance. He viewed Fami's presence as a chance to experiment, to push the boundaries of his culinary expertise and create dishes that could satisfy her boundless appetite. With newfound determination, Forrest and his team brainstormed innovative recipes, tirelessly working to deliver flavors that would captivate Fami's taste buds. They began to craft truly unique and extravagant cheese-based creations, incorporating rare ingredients and exploring uncharted gastronomic territories. Word spread of \\"The Cheese Whiz's\\" ability to satiate Fami's hunger, attracting curious patrons eager to witness this spectacle. The once-hidden gem of a restaurant became a bustling hotspot, with customers hoping to catch a glimpse of Fami devouring plates upon plates of cheese-inspired masterpieces. Behind the scenes, however, the staff grappled with the challenges Fami's appetite presented. The constant need to restock supplies, stay ahead of her voracious cravings, and maintain the quality of their offerings tested their limits. Yet, they persevered, their devotion to the exceptional experience unyielding. Fami, unaware of the chaos she unintentionally caused, continued to relish in the mouthwatering dishes served before her. The staff marveled at her ability to consume copious amounts of food while maintaining her graceful demeanor. Despite their initial shock, they couldn't help but admire her unwavering passion for indulging in the finest culinary delights. In the midst of the chaos, Forrest and Fami developed a peculiar bond. They found solace in their shared love for food, with Forrest constantly surprising Fami with new creations that pushed the limits of their imagination. Fami, in turn, astounded Forrest with her unyielding appetite and genuine appreciation for his culinary genius. Despite the challenges Fami's presence posed, the staff at \\"The Cheese Whiz\\" embraced the reality of her insatiable hunger as an opportunity to explore new horizons, push their creative boundaries, and make their mark in the culinary world. Through the chaos, they discovered a profound sense of fulfillment, knowing that their creations could match Fami's insatiable appetite and bring pure joy to those who sought out their exceptional dining experience."},{"prompt":"Fami also cannot deny she is falling for Forrest, not just as Mr. Cheese Whiz but as Forrest Hurley. A devil in love is a scary sight. There isn't a moment Forrest feels he isn't being watched, but admittedly he doesn't dislike the feeling. To get her to reveal herself, he cooks up a pull-apart cheese skillet. A cheesy center is surrounded by pretzel bites. She suddenly teleports into his kitchen.","completion":"As Forrest whipped up the tantalizing aroma of the pull-apart cheese skillet, he couldn't help but feel a mixture of excitement and nervousness. He had noticed the subtle hints of Fami's developing affection towards him and the undeniable aura of her constant presence even when she wasn't physically there. With the dish prepared, Forrest carefully arranged the warm and gooey cheese center, encircled by perfectly baked pretzel bites. He had poured his heart and creativity into this creation, hoping it would be enough to lure Fami out from her hidden vantage point. Just as he placed the skillet on the counter, a faint wisp of smoke filled the air, and Fami appeared before Forrest, her burgundy concentric eyes fixed on him. Fami: (smirking) My, Mr. Cheese Whiz, it seems you've finally managed to catch my attention. What delightful surprise do you have in store for me today? Forrest: (grinning) I've prepared something special, especially for you, Fami. A delectable combination of cheese and pretzel bites that I thought might tickle your taste buds. Care to join me? Fami, unable to resist the allure of the dish and the magnetic pull she felt towards Forrest, gracefully moved closer. She delicately tore a pretzel bite from the skillet, savoring the combination of gooey cheese and the slightly salty crunch. Fami: (munching thoughtfully) Mmm, a perfect balance of flavors. You've truly outdone yourself, Forrest. How did you know this would capture my heart? Forrest: (meeting her gaze) Call it intuition, or perhaps a deep connection between two individuals who share a passion for food. You have been a constant presence in my thoughts, Fami, not just as the Famine Devil but as the remarkable woman you truly are. A flicker of surprise danced across Fami's eyes, momentarily revealing vulnerability beneath her collected exterior. Fami: (softly) Forrest, you intrigue me. No one has ever seen beyond my insatiable hunger, let alone cared for the person within. But be warned, a devil in love can be a dangerous thing. Forrest: (taking her hand) Fami, I see you for who you are, beyond the label of a devil. You've ignited a fire within me, and I'm willing to accept the risks that come with it. Let us explore this connection, together. The atmosphere in the kitchen shifted, tinged with a mix of danger and raw emotion. Fami, torn between her devil instincts and newfound feelings, felt a surge of overwhelming emotions she had never experienced before. As they stood in that intimate moment, the pull-apart cheese skillet forgotten, Fami realized that there was more to life than just her insatiable hunger. She was hungry for something deeper – a connection, a love that transcended the boundaries of their worlds. From that point on, Fami and Forrest embarked on an unpredictable journey, fueled by their shared passion for food and an unyielding love that could defy the limits imposed upon them. Bound by their affection, they embraced the uncertainty of their future, determined to carve a path that would challenge the established norms of their devil and human counterparts."},{"prompt":"«Люди часто говорят, что мотивация недолговечна.

Зиглар был мастером слова и известен тем, что мог глубокие истины выразить так просто, что они становились очевидны даже для школьника. Итак, к чему он клонит, говоря о мотивации и купании? Представьте себе: встаёте вы утром, весь такой поспавший и мечтательный, и первым делом идёте в душ, чтобы привести себя в порядок. Это действие становится стартовой площадкой для всех дел дня. Но что если вместо этого вы просто решите поскакать вокруг кровати, надеясь, что запах \\"чистоты и свежести\\" каким-то чудесным образом проникнет в ваше существо? Абсурдно, правда? Точно так же абсурдно и пренебрегать ежедневной дозой мотивации. Мы ежедневно купаем тело, чтобы оно было свежим и заряженным. Почему бы не сделать так же для ума? Мотивация - это как вода для души. Она чистит наши мысли от негатива, смывает старую, усталую лень и заряжает на новые свершения. И как только вода вытекает через слив, мотивации требуется новая порция. Мы часто зацикливаемся на том, что достаточно поставить будильник на пять утра, встать с криком \\"Ахо-Хо\\" и вот она — продуктивность гарантирована. Но как и чистота после душа, мотивация проходит. Она нуждается в регулярном обновлении. Так что, давайте берём лучшие моменты утра, заряжаем их радостью и заносим в плюсик к нашему внутреннему рабочему столу.

Also, I'm a girl who doesn't watch yaoi but ships Narusasu as a platonic type of thing more than romantic (It's just that I feel Naruto truly feels brotherly love for Sasuke and I like the bible kind of ultimate love being the one you show for a friend without a reward/anything in exchange). BUT I cannot deny that there are many romantic undertones in their relationship that for me they only add more beauty to their unique bond without 'cheapening' it but rather making it poetically beautiful. Let's take Sasuke's family background that it is thoroughly shown to us during his first vote flashback scenes: Sasuke in a few words is: close to his mother, tries to get recognition but ultimately has a poor relationship with his father and desperately tries to reach the high bars his own brother raised far up and above him. Now let's analyse the above data in psychological terms: According to Freud, during the child's first years (3-6) the Oedipus complex is established where the boy feels sexual desire for his own mother which leads it to feel an emotional rivalry with the father cause the last is the 'privileged one' to sleep with the mother. The boy wants to be united with the mother and on first thought he has the impulse to want to kill the father but on a second thought based on reality knows that the father is stronger and thus instead of the boy wishing his death, he tries to identify with him. During the identification process, the boy internalises the personality characteristics and the masculinity of the father. In identifying with the aggressor-father, the boy diminishes his castration (the father’s ability to render him powerless) and defends himself from the father’s wrath as the two contend for the mother. When the identification process is done successfully the boy establishes a mature sexual behaviour that leads to heterosexuality, whereas failure in resulting the Oedipus complex may lead to homosexuality and thus fixation with identification only with the mother. In Sasuke's case, Fugaku was a strict father that acknowledged him only when Itachi distanced himself from the clan and his father's opinions/ideologies. Sasuke of course thought about being a mere replacement for their father's once favourite Itachi, and proceeds on revealing his inner thoughts to Mikoto-something that Sasuke didn't do even in front of Itachi. We see that Sasuke is convinced that his father doesn't fully acknowledge him from the heart and he is once more driven closer to his mother for comfort and reassurance. In my opinion, Sasuke's identification with Fugaku miserably fails and it is evident when Fugaku points that Sasuke should stop following in his brother's footsteps, an advice that Sasuke won't ever follow and that's because Sasuke more than Fugaku or the whole Uchiha clan or even I dare to say the Hokage himself, admires his 'ni-ssan'. And that leads us to phychological fact on homosexuality No 2: Homosexuality is tightly linked to narcissism. The narcissistic behaviour manifests in the child in the appearance of his own sibling. As the child goes out of the 'weaning phase' with the mother, it tries desperately to restore the lost unity(the unity that he once had with his mother being in her body or being fed by her breast, according to Lacan) and it picks a love-object that is similar to itself; its own sibling. The object of love the boy picks is homosexual and leads to passion tied to the image of someone who looks very much like himself. Thus we have the intrusion complex, the complex when the child first begins to recognise with a rival. The identification process begins with sharing even 1 single trait(and later can be expanded upon other traits); In our story Sasuke identifies with Itachi based on their similar position in the family system ('I have the same blood with ni-ssan and I will not lose to him') and of course their similar appearance (the pond scene with Sasuke dropping a rock forming Itachi's face in the ripples of his own image in the river). Sasuke also identifies with Naruto the moment Sakura brings that the former is an orphan-actually even before that as his inner monologue at 478 reveals due to reasons other than living the tragic life of an orphan; pre-massacre Sasuke firstly identifies with Naruto's 'weakness' to desperately want to form bonds. In Lacan's words, 'I identify with someone who resembles the self image I love. I love that person as myself, because at some fundamental level I do not distinguish between myself and this other person'. Freud points at the essence of brotherhood saying 'These people love their delusion as they love themselves'. Sasuke kneels looking at an unconscious Naruto at vote 1 not because he wants to kiss him-let's be serious: Sasuke sees himself in Naruto right there right then. Naruto screams, is naive/doesn't understand the reasons why, cries and feels immense agony that Sasuke is taking the wrong, dark road and that's the same kid Sasuke experienced in front of an Itachi he never knew it existed; he refuses to believe that his ni-ssan would do such thing, he keeps asking why, Itachi calls him foolish and in the end Sasuke is left betrayed and broken from his brother's actions. On the other hand, Itachi both in his fillers and in his novels thinks how much Sasuke is like him and even better: he says that Sasuke doesn't have his wrinkles that Danzo once told him were a sign of his ill-fortune and on top of that Sasuke is pure and naive; a clean slate version may I say of Itachi if he were to live in a peace era not witnessing the brutality of a war. I can't help but bring Manfred's romantic poem in this one: ''She was like me in lineaments-- her eyes Her hair, her features, all, to the very tone Even of her voice, they said were like mine; But soften'd all, and temper'd into beauty; She had the same lone thoughts and wanderings, The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind To comprehend the universe: nor these Alone, but with them gentler powers than mine, Pity, and smiles, and tears-- which I had not; And tenderness-- but that I had for her; Humility-- and that I never had. Her faults were mine-- her virtues were her own-- I loved her, and destroy'd her!” From the above poem we see that there is an extreme idealisation of the beloved sister, whom her brother's love converts into an angel, a virgin or a goddess. In our story, early Shippuden Naruto defends Sasuke's beauty and coolness against Sai, Itachi as I typed above firmly believes that Sasuke is a better version of himself both physically and internally and Sasuke finds himself admiring the unattainable -as he says -backs of both Itachi and Naruto. Just like Manfred, Sasuke, Itachi and Naruto have a 'soft spot' for their significant other-the tenderness is exclusively retained for their loved-one while acting cool/distant in other occasions. Manfred as well as Itachi, Sasuke and Naruto refer to their ''identical-others'' as a greater perfection; the beloved object is identical to the subject except more perfect. As far as narcissism goes, the boy's sibling, who he genuinely loves as and more than himself, shows him who and what he is. The sibling acts as a mirror where the boy imitates movements, behaviours and trains of thoughts. The sibling becomes 'the ideal ego'-the image that the boy will strive to grasp and that will be reinforced if the sibling's achievements and overall behaviour is praised by the parents in front of the boy. How many times Sasuke heard 'That's my boy' from Fugaku to Itachi? That right there established the already worshipped image of the big brother-the approval of their father. His mother also points 'That boy is special' and later Sasuke will say in the first vote 'I am more special than you'-(but that's another subject that I'll discuss on a different post-Sasuke's ''self-punishing paranoia'' all the times he inflicted pain on Naruto). Narcissism also goes hand in hand with agressivity. It's what Lacan calls 'The pain of being two'. 'The other both attracts and rejects me. I am indeed nothing but the other, yet at the same time he remains alienus, a stranger. This other who is myself is other than myself' (Lacan). I can't help but to bring the curse casted on Narcissus in his tale: 'Let him know how it feels to yearn without hope'. The image of Sasuke at the pond-same as Narcissus- isn't random in my opinion. Narcissus becomes enamoured with his own image that captivates him ''like a rabbit is by the weasel's mesmerising look''(by the tales own words) and in our story Sasuke(the naive white rabbit) is both 'infatuated' looking at Itachi (the weasel the tale says) and aggressive as he throws himself into the river saying that he will grasp power no matter what. The aggression is manifested due to the subject's frustration that the specular image isn't united with his real body. It's as Kabuto says in 337 that Sasuke never stopped imitating Itachi. Even when the latter played the villain, Sasuke strived to become just like him-Itachi remained through it all Sasuke's ideal image of his own self. At the same time, Itachi keeps thinking even before dying(before giving his crow to Naruto) that Sasuke-the one who defected from Konoha and went to Oro- is still pure. Naruto doesn't even need explanation here-he is the epitome of blind trust and naivety when it comes to Sasuke. The ideal-image once it is established can't ever be undone. Little Sasuke looks at his brother's back growing bigger, farther away from him. He trains night and day to be able to reach him who he is his ideal version of his own self. The same thing is happening to Naruto in regards of Sasuke; he goes one step further in his training trying 'to build a bridge' as he said to Kakashi. The frustration of the siblings is that unity can be achieved only spiritually and not through the bodies as it once were with their mother. In our story the unity happens though parts of the body too(in my opinion to emphasise the desire to fuse, to unite with the other half) :Madara says that he only has his brother's eyes, Sasuke smiles when having his Nissan's eyes transplanted into his own body and Naruto and Sasuke have a chakra combo technique with the Susanoo covering Kurama (a symbolic body fusion). The Mangekyo itself works ONLY between siblings-not even close friends. They all strive to become one with their sibling but what they truly want/seek is the spiritual connection nonetheless. Sasuke and Naruto share an imaginary relation of love and war between equals and the resolution is this: Struggle to the death (one or the other) or coexistence(one and the other). In the end, the latter supersedes the former and hatred turns into deep love. Naruto up until Haku arc thought he hated Sasuke and Sasuke at the end of the story deeply loves his once targets of hatred, Itachi and Naruto. The spiritual connection(and not the 'carnal' one) is what saved all 3 of them; Naruto, Itachi and Sasuke. They are able to truly connect by sharing honest thoughts, words of love and memories of experiences that are familiar to the one another. As Freud says ''A man can love himself as he is, he can love himself as he was, he can love someone who was once a part of himself, and he can love what he himself would like to be cause the love-object possesses excellences he himself never had''. Sasuke keeps seeing Itachi and Naruto's backs while Itachi and Naruto see Sasuke as Manfred's poem; Sasuke's faults are their own(Itachi entirely blames himself for Sasuke's descend to darkness while Naruto keeps having the deepest regret of his life in not bonding with Sasuke much earlier before even Team 7) and Sasuke's virtues are his own only (Never did we hear Itachi or Naruto downplay Sasuke's accomplishments for example). Also, Sasuke loves Naruto partially because he sees both his little 'foolish little brother' self and Itachi's cool, powerful, wise and kindhearted self in Naruto's existence. On another note, in the history of homosexuals according to Freud, one often hears that the change in them took place after the mother had praised another boy and set him up as a model. The tendency to a narcissistic object-choice was thus stimulated, and after a short phase of keen jealousy, the rival became a love-object. I can't help but bring Mikoto mentioning how special Itachi is and Sakura (the mother figure of Team 7) pointing that Naruto may be stupid but he isn't a coward or later acknowledging that Naruto was the one who saved her from Gaara. Another aspect of narcissism that leads to homosexuality is the former's reparative concept: Through the narcissistic election of an object of love identical to the subject, satisfaction is achieved by curing the ego-wounding. The ego seeks some kind of repayment for an offense suffered, or for a perceived loss or defect. In simple terms, Sasuke gets to be fully accepted by Naruto who claims him as an equal that he wants by his side. Sasuke's wounded ego by his own family-especially Fugaku and later 'villain' Itachi- is cured by Naruto's paramount love, trust and devotion to him. Is Sasuke secretly in love with Naruto? I cannot answer for sure. And why the 'gay factor' applies only to Sasuke someone may ask? Because Sasuke out of all 3 of them is the one that suffered an inferiority complex and all the above family conditions. Itachi couldn't care less what his parents said about him while Naruto didn't have any parents and later the only times he gets to meet them they both are loving and supporting. Naruto also had the strength to not bring himself down from the villagers' harsh attitudes-that's the inner strength that Sasuke admitted he lacked. But I will end my post with a quote from Musil that I found so fitting for our Narusasu story: ''Great reckless passions all have something to do with the fact that everyone thinks it's his own secret self peering out at him from behind the curtains of a stranger's eyes''.

He clearly doesn't love Sakura but he doesnt show interest in men. Considering Naruto's target, sexuality drama will never be addressed but it seems a very heteronormative world with medieval rules on dating, in which men and women are pushed to marry in their late teens You should sum it. Reddit is not the best place to post deep analysis. Upvote 16 Downvote Reply reply Share Share narutoisthegoat • 5 yr. ago Your comment is spot on. Naruto doesn't seem gay to me at all though- he was just a lonely child that clang onto Sasuke cause he felt close to him and cause Sasuke offered him acknowledgement and unconditional love(his sacrifice at Haku) when Naruto needed it the most. Yes, we see Naruto wishing on a star for Sasuke, hyperventilating on the possibility of his death, chasing after him etc but all that staff are normal to me in a sense that I too feel like that for my brother. If we watch carefully, Naruto after the Pain arc(after the arc that he gain major confidence) change completely the way he acts around Sasuke; he isn't overwhelmed anymore nor afraid but instead he accepts the challenge that he first sought to achieve in order to be Hokage, that he will save his friend. In the war arc Naruto does the most damage to the villains, saves everyone multiple times and just minds his own business. Sasuke on the other hand, keeps looking at Naruto in a way that to me implies something more than 'you're my friend'. I don't know how to explain it. Even when they talk together at 478, Sasuke looks at Naruto in a tender way, keeps asking why/what a friend is(like seriously?) like expecting some love confession from Naruto a la Itachi. Naruto does tell him essentially that he loves him when he says that he hurts when Sasuke suffers. In 488 Sasuke says those extreme heartfelt words in my opinion for Naruto when Chino asks him why he defends Konoha: ''Because I am alive. I have a friend that saved me, a friend with whom I can share my pain, AND HIM, with me''. Where is Sakura in all this? Nowhere. Sasuke keeps having ties with Konoha only because of Naruto's very own existence (and Itachi's major sacrifice of course too). When people keep saying that Sasuke loves Sakura more than Naruto or Itachi, honestly I think they only see what they want to see. Ask yourselves a major question: Who did the most for Sasuke? Itachi and Naruto. Those 2 ''deserve'' his most love and devotion. It's like Sasuke once said to Tobi ''My life was more precious than the whole village to Itachi and that's how I feel too''. It always takes 2 to tango. If Sasuke didn't feel the same love for Naruto as Naruto did for him, then by no means he was ever 'saveable'. Itachi, Naruto and even Sakura admitted that Naruto is the one that can save him. If I don't feel love for someone, whatever that someone does for me would fall in deaf ears. If I feel for him, I can give him a chance to come closer. The society system is conservative but I think there is good reason to be; Let's not forget that ninjas aren't destined to live long lives, they will all die at a young age and if we take into account Jiraiya's quote that it is how they die that matters the most, they are sure to suffer a painful yet meaningful death. When death is around the corner anytime, humans tend to be more romantic and grasp on the truly valuable things in life that is love and family. If we add that Naruto as well as many ninjas are orphans or lost loved ones , then the need to start a family at a young age grows even bigger. But conservative as all may look at first glance, there is Oro, Kabuto and now Boruto manga with the dark staff. Haku also is a girly boy that likes to cross-dress and makes compliments about Zabuza's perfect body-lol! All in all, reddit is more for versus battles who wins what and when you try to analyse something they attack you calling you tulmbr!! I said that I don't watch yaoi and they keep saying that I have fantasies of Narusasu.. I just lean on believing that Sasuke is homosexual cause he has the family background to support such a statement. Are all men with inferiority complexes gay? Of course not. But Sasuke has shown hints that maybe he's not into women. Yes, Sakura is a mother figure to him but does he feel romantic passion for her? Does he blush, lose his words, anticipate to meet her and be with her etc etc?? I would believe he is straight if Sasuke all those 10 years had met with Sakura only, even if it was once a year. Sasuke keeps carrying the headband Naruto gave him but any Sakura picture in his pocket? Again, no. Where is the love??(that was rhetorical-lol!!)

This detailed post uses psychological theories, particularly those of Freud and Lacan, to analyze Sasuke's character development in the anime and manga series \\"Naruto.\\" It delves into Sasuke's relationships with his family and other characters, namely Itachi and Naruto, to argue why Sasuke might be portrayed with homosexual undertones. Other users have commented on the post, some appreciating the depth of the analysis while others felt the topic was either over-analyzed or not suited for a character from a fictional series. Subsequent comments from other Reddit users range from humorous and brief dismissals to more serious discussions about how the character dynamics in \\"Naruto\\" could potentially be interpreted through the lens of psychological or queer theory. The post also touches on themes of narcissism, sibling relationships, and the concept of the \\"ideal ego,\\" discussing how these psychological ideas could manifest in Sasuke's interactions with his brother and Naruto. The discussion ultimately concludes that while it's unclear whether Sasuke could be considered gay, bisexual, or asexual, the series presents a complex portrait of his relationships that could be open to interpretation, particularly concerning his deep bond with Naruto. This kind of analysis is quite common among fans of various media who discuss and dissect characters and stories to explore themes and interpretations that may not be explicitly addressed in the material itself. However, given this is a sensitive and complex topic, many fans may have differing opinions on how appropriate or accurate it is to apply such theories to fictional characters."},{"prompt":"我是一个资深的产品经理，需要你辅助我进行需求分析。可以吗？","completion":"当然可以！作为聊天机器人，我可以帮助你进行需求分析。请告诉我你需要分析的具体需求，并提供相关的背景信息和细节。我会尽力协助你进行需求分析。"},{"prompt":"suggest some music for my youtube shorts podcast on reality of todays peoples","completion":"When choosing music for a YouTube Shorts podcast, you'll want to consider tracks that reflect the tone and content of your podcast.

Medical practitioners must continually stay updated with the latest research, advancements in treatment, and medical guidelines. A solid foundation of medical knowledge, combined with the ability to effectively apply it, enables doctors to make informed decisions and provide the best possible care for their patients. Additionally, doctors should possess strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, allowing them to diagnose complex conditions and develop suitable treatment plans. Communication skills play a crucial role in forming a strong doctor-patient relationship. Good doctors are effective communicators, able to explain medical concepts and treatment options in a clear and understandable manner. They actively listen to their patients, answer their questions, and address their concerns. Effective communication not only fosters trust but also helps patients feel more involved in their own healthcare decisions, leading to improved healthcare outcomes. Another quality of a good doctor is resilience. The medical profession is inherently challenging and demanding, often involving long working hours and difficult situations. Doctors must possess resilience to overcome obstacles, manage stress, and maintain their emotional well-being. The ability to adapt to changing circumstances and maintain professionalism in the face of adversity is essential for providing quality care to patients. Last but not least, ethical conduct is a cornerstone of being a good doctor. Doctors must adhere to the highest ethical standards, ensuring patient confidentiality, respecting autonomy, and making decisions in the best interest of their patients. Upholding integrity, honesty, and professionalism is crucial to maintain the trust and respect of both patients and colleagues. In conclusion, a good doctor or medical practitioner possesses qualities that extend beyond medical expertise. Empathy, knowledge, communication skills, resilience, and ethical conduct are all essential attributes. By embodying these qualities, doctors can form strong and trusting relationships with their patients, provide compassionate care, and contribute to the well-being of individuals and communities. Thank you."},{"prompt":"你现在是很厉害的演讲者，我现在给你一个题目要求你在3分钟内讲完，题目为：4. Ways to solve the tense relationship between doctors and patients. 给我提供你的演讲稿","completion":"Ladies and gentlemen, Today, I would like to address the issue of the tense relationship between doctors and patients. This is a crucial topic that requires attention and proactive measures to foster a healthy and constructive dynamic between healthcare providers and those seeking medical care. In just three minutes, I will share four effective ways to solve this issue. Firstly, improving communication is vital to resolving the tense relationship between doctors and patients. Open and honest communication is essential for building trust and understanding. Doctors should actively listen to their patients, ensuring that their concerns are heard and addressed. On the other hand, patients should feel empowered to ask questions and actively participate in their care. By fostering a culture of transparent and compassionate communication, the tension between doctors and patients can be reduced significantly. Secondly, enhancing empathy is crucial in improving the relationship between doctors and patients. Doctors should put themselves in the shoes of their patients, understanding their emotions and concerns. This requires a deep sense of empathy and compassion. Taking the time to explain medical conditions, treatment options, and potential outcomes in a patient-centered manner can go a long way in building trust and alleviating tension. By showing understanding and empathy, doctors foster a sense of partnership and collaboration with their patients. Thirdly, promoting shared decision-making plays a significant role in resolving the tense relationship between doctors and patients. Rather than solely dictating treatment plans, doctors should involve patients in the decision-making process. This involves providing clear and concise information about the available options, their potential benefits and risks, and empowering patients to make informed decisions regarding their own care. Patients who feel involved in their treatment plan are more likely to have a positive relationship with their doctors. Lastly, fostering a culture of respect and understanding is essential in solving the tense relationship between doctors and patients. Doctors should be respectful of their patients' values, beliefs, and preferences. They should demonstrate cultural competence and sensitivity towards individual differences. Similarly, patients should also show respect towards their doctors' expertise and medical advice. By recognizing and valuing each other's perspectives, a sense of mutual respect can be fostered, leading to a healthier relationship between doctors and patients. In conclusion, solving the tense relationship between doctors and patients requires a multifaceted approach. Improving communication, enhancing empathy, promoting shared decision-making, and fostering a culture of respect and understanding are key steps towards establishing a constructive and positive dynamic. By working together, doctors and patients can build a relationship based on trust, transparency, and mutual respect, ultimately resulting in better healthcare outcomes. Thank you."},{"prompt":"你现在是很厉害的演讲者，我现在给你一个题目要求你在3分钟内讲完，题目为：The meaning of life and work. 给我提供你的演讲稿","completion":"Ladies and gentlemen, Today, I would like to delve into the profound topic of the meaning of life and work. In just three minutes, I will share my thoughts and reflections on this intriguing subject. Life is a journey filled with moments of joy, challenges, and self-discovery. It is often characterized by the pursuit of happiness and finding a sense of purpose. When we talk about the meaning of life, we are essentially exploring why we exist and what gives our lives significance. For many, the essence of life lies in the pursuit of fulfillment and personal growth. It is about discovering our passions, honing our talents, and continually striving to become the best versions of ourselves. It is through this process of self-improvement and self-actualization that we find meaning in our individual lives. Work, being an integral part of our lives, plays a crucial role in our search for meaning. The meaning of work goes beyond mere financial stability or professional accomplishments. It lies in finding a sense of purpose and fulfillment in what we do. When we engage in work that aligns with our values, passions, and strengths, we experience a deep sense of satisfaction and meaning. Work can take various forms, whether it is pursuing a career, starting a business, or dedicating oneself to a cause. Regardless of the nature of our work, finding meaning in it is dependent on our ability to impact others positively. When our work serves a greater purpose, contributes to the well-being of others, or makes a difference in the world, it adds significance and fulfillment to our lives. However, it is important to recognize that finding meaning in life and work is a deeply personal and subjective journey. What brings meaning to one person may not necessarily bring the same sense of significance to another. It requires introspection, self-reflection, and a willingness to explore our values, passions, and aspirations. Additionally, the meaning of life and work is not a static concept. It evolves and changes as we grow and experience different stages of life. It is important to adapt and reassess our priorities and goals to ensure that we continue to find meaning and fulfillment. In conclusion, the meaning of life and work is a profound and personal quest. It is about discovering our passions, engaging in work that aligns with our values, and positively impacting others. It is a continuous journey of self-discovery, growth, and adaptation. By finding meaning in our individual lives and work, we add richness and purpose to our existence. Thank you."},{"prompt":"Compared with NH2-MIL-125(Ti), Co/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) exhibits a significantly enhanced activity in CO2 reduction, due to the fact that the doping of Co nanoparticles onto NH2-MIL-125(Ti) can promote the visible-light harvesting and electron transfer.","completion":"The presence of Co nanoparticles in NH2-MIL-125(Ti) leads to a higher activity in the reduction of CO2. This is primarily attributed to two factors: enhanced visible-light harvesting and improved electron transfer. Firstly, the doping of Co nanoparticles onto NH2-MIL-125(Ti) enables better utilization of visible light for the CO2 reduction reaction. NH2-MIL-125(Ti) alone has limited absorption in the visible region, which restricts its photoactivity. However, the introduction of Co nanoparticles extends the absorption range of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) to include visible light wavelengths. This increased light absorption allows for more efficient utilization of solar energy in the CO2 reduction process. Secondly, the presence of Co nanoparticles facilitates electron transfer during the CO2 reduction reaction. Co nanoparticles act as electron transfer mediators, facilitating the transfer of electrons between the photoexcited NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and the CO2 molecules. This improved electron transfer process leads to a higher efficiency in converting CO2 into reduced products, such as CO or other value-added chemicals. Overall, the doping of Co nanoparticles onto NH2-MIL-125(Ti) enhances the activity in CO2 reduction by promoting visible-light harvesting and electron transfer. This improved performance makes Co/NH2-MIL-125(Ti) a promising catalyst for CO2 conversion into valuable products."},{"prompt":"Write me a story about the Wordgirl villains noticing their teammate Whammer looking particularly down in the dumps. When they ask what’s wrong, he just sighs that he doesn’t know, he’s just been really sad and self loathing lately and he doesn’t know why.","completion":"The villains of Fair City were known for their cunning, their mischief, and their unwavering determination to bring chaos to the peaceful town. Among them, there was Lady Redundant Woman with her duplication powers, The Butcher with his meaty schemes, and Chuck the Evil Sandwich Making Guy, who, despite his odd profession, always found himself in the midst of villainous plots. And then there was Whammer. Whammer was physically the most imposing of the villains. He had bulging muscles and an incredible strength, and his ability to create windstorms with his mighty hammer made him a worthy adversary for any superhero. But lately, he hadn't been his usual self. His usually boisterous laughter was replaced by sighs, and his large shoulders were slumped as he walked around the villains' lair. One gloomy day, as Lady Redundant Woman and Chuck stacked a tower of sandwiches, they caught sight of Whammer sitting alone, staring at the ground. Concerned, they exchanged glances before making their way over to him. \\"Hey, Whammer,\\" Lady Redundant Woman said, putting a hand on his massive shoulder. \\"What's up, buddy? You seem down in the dumps.\\" Whammer let out a deep sigh and shrugged. \\"I don't know, guys. I've just been feeling...sad and self-loathing lately. And I don't even know why.\\" The Butcher, who had been silently observing from afar, shuffled over and joined the conversation. \\"Sad and self-loathing? That's not like you, Whammer. You're usually the one all about brute force and destruction. What's been going on?\\" Whammer shifted uncomfortably on the giant boulder he'd been using as a seat. \\"Honestly, I don't know. Maybe it's the heroic victories we've been losing lately, or the fact that we always seem to lose to Wordgirl,\\" he said, his voice filled with defeat. \\"I just feel like I'm not good enough as a villain. Like I'm a failure.\\" Lady Redundant Woman put a hand on Whammer's arm. \\"Oh, Whammer, don't say that! You're an essential part of our villainous team. Your strength and powers make you formidable, and you bring so much to the table.\\" Chuck nodded in agreement. \\"Absolutely! We all have our roles, Whammer. And we need your unparalleled might to make our plans successful. You're strong, reliable, and an important member of this team.\\" Whammer looked at his teammates, astonishment etched on his face. \\"You really think that?\\" \\"Of course!\\" Lady Redundant Woman exclaimed. \\"We've got your back, buddy. We all have our moments of doubt and self-loathing, but together, we can overcome anything. Remember, villains don't give up!\\" Whammer's demeanor shifted slightly, as if a glimmer of his old confidence had returned. A small smile tugged at the corners of his lips. \\"Thanks, guys. I needed to hear that. Maybe I've been so focused on my internal struggles that I've forgotten the power of teamwork.\\" The Butcher patted his back with a meaty hand. \\"That's the spirit! We are the villains of Fair City, after all. Let's regroup, come up with a new plan, and show Wordgirl what we're truly made of!\\" With renewed determination, Whammer stood up from his boulder. Together, the villains huddled, brainstorming and plotting their next move. Whammer's self-doubt started to crumble away, replaced by a fiery determination to prove himself. And so, the villains of Fair City set off once again, their spirits renewed. Whammer, once feeling lost and alone, now stood tall among his teammates, ready to face any challenge that came their way. For, in the end, they were more than just villains; they were a family united by their unwavering support for each other."},{"prompt":"Please write one of the scenes for the chapter of a fantasy novel. The story takes place in the future in 2242. The tournament was in full swing. It's time for Reyna and her sister Lily to enter the training ground for the exhibition fight. Ten-year-old Lily stood opposite Reyna in a fighting stance. Reina released the power of black flames and clots of powerful energy swirled around her. Lily understood that she was weak and that she was much weaker than her fifteen-year-old sister. Reyna was the crown princess of the galactic empire. Her father stripped her of her title and inheritance and threw her out onto the street. He made Lily heir. Reyna vowed to take back everything that was taken from her. Lily helped her father and Reina decided to take revenge on her sister at this tournament for her betrayal.","completion":"A hush fell over the crowds as the two sisters, Reyna and Lily, stepped into the center of the shimmering training ground, an arena lit by floating orbs and encased in a translucent shield shimmering under the twin suns of the planet Vestrana. The tournament, celebrated once every decade, was a spectacle that gathered citizens from every corner of the galactic empire, and this year’s event had attracted even more attention. It was not just the combat that drew the eyes of thousands, but the blood drama that underpinned it. Reyna, once a crown princess, her purple cloak billowing behind her like a shadow of her lost regality, locked eyes with ten-year-old Lily, dressed in the emblematic silver of the imperial house. Though young, Lily held her head high, adopting a fighting stance that revealed her training under the empire's best tutors. But beneath her poised exterior, the flutter behind her chest betrayed her trepidation. The air crackled with palpable energy as Reyna stretched out her hand, summoning the power that had once been her birthright. Black flames erupted around her fists, pulsating like the heart of a dying star, casting eerie shadows over her hardened features. Whispers surged through the crowd, a mixture of awe and fear, as they watched the dark tendrils of force play around her, the desolate power that had once made her the empire's greatest enigma. Lily's eyes widened as she watched the energy swell, the vast gap in their powers becoming starkly apparent. She had been born weak, untouched by the extraordinary gifts that had graced Reyna. While her sister had been lauded for her prowess, Lily had been her shadow, never quite stepping into the light. That had all changed when the emperor, their father, had denounced Reyna, casting her out into the unforgiving streets of their advanced world. With one cruel twist of fate, he had elevated Lily, naming her the heir and leaving Reyna with nothing but the burning embers of vengeance smoldering within her heart. Reyna had returned from her exile changed, hardened by betrayal and the will to reclaim what had been torn from her grasp. Now, as the audience's breaths held in anticipation, Reyna's gaze pierced through Lily, seeing not the sister she had once loved, but the embodiment of her betrayal. \\"Begin!\\" The adjudicator's voice boomed, magnified by the arena's acoustic enchantments. Lily moved first, her small frame darting forward with a speed that hid her nervousness. She unleashed a flurry of well-executed but harmless light beams from her fingertips, a mark of her raw yet unseasoned abilities. Reyna deflected them effortlessly, striding forth with a predator's grace. She unleashed a whip of black flame towards Lily, who narrowly rolled away, feeling the searing heat graze her tunic. The crowd gasped, torn between the spectacle and the unsettling reality of the confrontation. \\"Lily,\\" Reyna's voice cut through the chaos, smooth as obsidian. \\"This empire was built on power, on strength. You should have never been a part of it.\\" Lily's heart pounded in her chest as she avoided another of Reyna's assaults, her eyes brimming with a mix of fear and pleading. \\"Reyna, I never wanted it to be this way! Please...\\" But Reyna was unyielding, her resolve as impenetrable as the energy shield around the arena. With a swift motion, she summoned a vortex of dark flames, engulfing Lily in a fearsome tempest that roared like the rage within her. As the onslaught subsided, Lily emerged, singed and battered, but alive. The little sister looked up at Reyna with a mixture of distress and defiance, a silent plea for recognition of their bond. The tournament was never about proving who was the strongest—it was Reyna’s stage for revenge, her theater of war. There, in the merciless glow of the future's unforgiving light, the battle between the sisters unfurled—a cruel dance of destiny that whispered of a kingdom divided and a family broken beyond repair."},{"prompt":"你明白需求分析中的 5W2H的分析方法嘛？","completion":"是的，我了解5W2H的分析方法。它是一种常用的需求分析工具，用于帮助我们全面、系统地了解和定义需求。 5W代表的是：What（是什么）、Why（为什么）、Who（谁）、When（何时）、Where（何地），这些问题帮助我们明确需求的性质、原因、相关的角色和时间/地点限制。 2H代表的是：How（如何）和How much（多少），这些问题帮助我们确定需求的实现方式以及所需资源的数量。 通过综合分析这些问题，可以帮助我们更好地理解需求，并能够为项目的开发、实施和监管提供有价值的信息。"},{"prompt":"","completion":"这种分析方法的具体步骤是： 1.

Lily helped her father and Reina decided to take revenge on her sister at this tournament for her betrayal. But Reina did not know that her father and sister acted so cruelly out of love for Reina and to save her from death. Write the dialogues. Write the entire prompt from beginning to end.","completion":"As the metallic clang of swords and the cheers of the audience echoed through the vast Training Ground of Esmeron, two sisters prepared to face each other in a battle that was more than a mere display of skill. Reyna, a vision of power and defiance, stood across the wide, open grounds, enveloping herself in a shroud of darkness as black flames licked her arms hungrily. Lily, small and sprightly at just ten, mirrored Reyna's position with a warrior's stance far beyond her tender years. Her green, solemn eyes locked with her sister's fierce gaze, a silent conversation passing between them. Reyna's voice was sharp as a whip crack, effortlessly cutting through the din. \\"Little sister, do you understand what this fight means? Do you realize this is not just an exhibition, but my ascent to reclaim what is rightfully mine?\\" Lily's reply carried with it a calm resolve that belied her youth. \\"I do, Reyna. I understand more than you know. But this is the path that has been laid before us.\\" With a swift motion, Reyna unleashed her black flames into the air, the energy pulsating and twisting into shapes that whispered of her controlled rage. \\"Father may have chosen you to wear the crown, Lily, but know this — it will be mine again.\\" Lily felt the weight of Reyna's power, but stood unwavering. \\"I am not the villain in your story, sister. Our father's decisions weigh heavily on my heart too. If you could only see—\\" Reyna interrupted, eyes ablaze, \\"See what? How you stood by him? How you did nothing while he discarded me like the shell of a forgotten star?\\" Tears shimmered in Lily's eyes, but her voice was steady. \\"Reyna, we did it to protect you! Please believe me, there's a danger—\\" \\"Danger?\\" Reyna spat out the word as if it were poison. \\"I am the heiress to the Galactic Empire. I was born into danger, nurtured by it. There is no threat that could justify your betrayal!\\" Lily clasped her hands together, as if holding onto hope. \\"It was never betrayal, Reyna. It was a sacrifice. We wanted to keep you safe—from a prophecy that sealed your doom.\\" Silence fell between them as the truth gnawed at Reyna's resolve. Her flames flickered, dimmed, then grew in intensity as if fighting the uncertainty inside her. \\"Lies,\\" Reyna hissed. \\"All lies.\\" \\"No,\\" Lily said quietly, stepping forward, unarmed and exposed as the ultimate gesture of trust. \\"It is not a lie. Father and I did what we thought best. This exhibition... it's a chance to show you that you are loved, that your life matters more than titles or thrones.\\" Reyna's energy whirled chaotically about her, a testament to her inner struggle. Finally, she doused the dark flames, and the silence became complete, as though the world held its breath. She looked at Lily, seeing not the anointed heir but her little sister, earnest and scared, reaching out across an abyss of misunderstanding and hurt. Reyna lowered her weapon and stepped forward, her voice softer now with the raw edge of vulnerability. \\"Can love be so cruel as to wound so deeply?\\" she asked. \\"It was never meant to wound. It was the only way to shield you,\\" Lily replied, her hand reaching out. The two sisters, finally bridging the divide between them, clasped hands. In that moment, the crowd's roar faded, and the spectacle of the tournament dissolved. There, in the center of the Training Ground of Esmeron, the true exhibition unfolded: a demonstration of forgiveness, of family bonds, and the complex love that could both bind and free. Reyna's eyes shone not with power but with a new understanding. \\"I will need to learn of this prophecy, and we will face whatever comes...together.\\" \\"And together, we will change our fate,\\" Lily affirmed with a determined nod, the two sisters standing united, facing an uncertain but hopeful future."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

Close your eyes and take three deep breaths, feeling your lungs expand with life and your body relax with each exhale. Imagine every worry and tension leaving your body with every breath you release. With your eyes closed, visualize yourself standing at the edge of a lush, enchanted forest. The air is crisp and filled with the fragrance of pine and earth. A path lies before you, dappled with sunlight filtering through the canopy of leaves. You take a step forward, and as you do, you feel the soft forest floor beneath your feet. As you walk, notice the sounds around you. The rustle of leaves, the gentle caress of the wind, and the distant, soothing chorus of forest life form a symphony that invites deeper relaxation. Allow these sounds to escort you further into your inner world. Now, in the heart of the forest, you see a clearing. In its center stands an ancient tree, its branches reaching high into the sky, its roots delving deep into the heart of the earth. This tree is a symbol of your own life—steadfast, strong, and serene. Approach the tree and place your hand upon its rough bark. Feel the energy pulsate beneath your touch. This tree holds the wisdom of your inner self. With every beat like a heartbeat, it invites you to enter a secret opening at its base—the doorway to your inner sanctuary. You step through the portal and find yourself floating gently down into a realm of inner peace. The space around you is bathed in a warm, golden light. This is the core of your being, the place where your deepest thoughts, your unspoken dreams, and your true essence reside. Here in this sanctum, you see a tranquil pool of water, its surface clear and still, reflecting only the truth. You sit by its edge and gaze into it. Within its depths, you find answers to your questions, comfort for your uncertainties, and a connection to the infinite wisdom that lies within you. Take a moment to listen, to truly listen, to the silence that speaks volumes. What does it tell you about yourself? What long-forgotten truth does it bring to light? Perhaps it is a message of love, of assurance, or of guidance. As you absorb these insights, you feel more grounded, more centered. Trust in the knowing that this sanctuary is always here for you to visit whenever you seek solace or need to reconnect with your core. When you are ready, gently ascend from this sacred space, carrying with you the peace and understanding you've found. You exit through the opening in the tree, finding yourself once again in the heart of the forest. Wander back along the path, feeling a newfound sense of harmony with each step. The sounds of the forest now seem like a celebration of your journey within. As you reach the edge of the forest, you take three deep breaths again, grounding yourself in the present moment. Wiggle your toes, move your fingers, and when you are ready, gently open your eyes. You have returned from your inner sanctuary, bringing with you the calmness and clarity that you can now carry into the world. Remember, this place of peace is always within you, just a few deep breaths away. --- I hope this guided meditation story helps bring you to a place of inner peace and introspection.

Here's the corrected code: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Assuming LHS_matrix and Y are numpy arrays with the shapes (800, len(LB)) and (800, 2*len(mode_list)), respectively # Initialize Rho to hold the Spearman correlation values Rho = np.zeros((len(LHS_matrix[0]), len(Y[0]))) for i in range(len(LHS_matrix[0])): # loop over inputs for j in range(len(Y[0])): # loop over outputs corr, _ = spearmanr(LHS_matrix[:, i], Y[:, j]) Rho[i, j] = corr rho = Rho.T # Plot the heatmap fig, ax = plt.subplots() idx = (rho <= -0.30) | (rho >= 0.30) # Find the indices of rho outside the range cax = ax.imshow(np.where(idx, rho, np.nan), cmap='coolwarm', vmin=-1, vmax=1) # Only show the values outside the range # Set tick labels (make sure the labels match the dimensions of Rho) input_labels = [...] # Replace with your actual input labels output_labels = [...] # Replace with your actual output labels ax.set_xticks(np.arange(len(input_labels))) ax.set_yticks(np.arange(len(output_labels))) ax.set_xticklabels(input_labels, rotation=45, fontsize=10) ax.set_yticklabels(output_labels) ax.set_xlabel('Inputs') ax.set_ylabel('Outputs') ax.set_title('Spearman Correlation Coefficient Matrix') # Add a color bar to the heatmap cbar = fig.colorbar(cax) # Adjust layout to make room for the rotated x tick labels plt.tight_layout() plt.show() \`\`\` Please replace the \`[...]\` placeholders with your actual labels for the inputs and outputs. The labels must be in the same order as the columns of \`LHS_matrix\` and \`Y\`. Make sure \`len(input_labels)\` equals the number of columns in \`LHS_matrix\`, and \`len(output_labels)\` equals the number of columns in \`Y\`."},{"prompt":"improve the code","completion":"Certainly! As previously discussed, we need to ensure that the \`Rho\` matrix is properly initialized and sized based on your input (\`LHS_matrix\`) and output (\`Y\`) matrices. Let's also clean up the plotting section with proper labeling and display only correlations that meet the specified threshold. The following is the improved code: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.stats import spearmanr # Define your LHS_matrix (800x14) and Y (800x14) here # These variables should be NumPy arrays with shapes as indicated # LHS_matrix = ... # Y = ... # In case you don't have the dataset yet, here's how to initialize the Rho matrix num_inputs = LHS_matrix.shape[1] # This should be 14 according to the assumption num_outputs = Y.shape[1] # This should also be 14 # Initialize the Rho matrix to zeros Rho = np.zeros((num_inputs, num_outputs)) # Calculate Spearman correlation coefficients for i in range(num_inputs): for j in range(num_outputs): corr, _ = spearmanr(LHS_matrix[:, i], Y[:, j]) Rho[i, j] = corr # Transpose Rho to align the axes as required for plotting rho = Rho.T # Prepare labels for the input and output parameters (replace these with actual labels) input_labels = [f'Input {i+1}' for i in range(num_inputs)] output_labels = [f'Output {i+1}' for i in range(num_outputs)] # Plot the heatmap with a specified threshold threshold = 0.3 fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 10)) # Use masked array to hide values below the threshold masked_rho = np.ma.masked_where((rho > -threshold) & (rho < threshold), rho) cax = ax.imshow(masked_rho, cmap='coolwarm', vmin=-1, vmax=1, aspect='auto') # Set tick positions and labels ax.set_xticks(np.arange(num_inputs)) ax.set_yticks(np.arange(num_outputs)) ax.set_xticklabels(input_labels, rotation=45, ha='right') ax.set_yticklabels(output_labels) # Set axis labels and title ax.set_xlabel('Input Parameters') ax.set_ylabel('Output Parameters') ax.set_title('Spearman Correlation Coefficient Matrix') # Add a color bar to the heatmap cbar = fig.colorbar(cax) cbar.ax.set_ylabel('Spearman Correlation') # Use tight_layout to fit labels neatly within the figure plt.tight_layout() plt.show() \`\`\` Key improvements include: 1. Properly initializing the \`Rho\` matrix based on the dimensions of \`LHS_matrix\` and \`Y\`. 2. Using a masked array with \`np.ma.masked_where()\` to only display correlations outside the threshold, making it easier to focus on significant correlations. 3. Adjusting the figure size and aspect ratio to accommodate the labels without squashing the heatmap. 4. Rotating x-axis labels and setting their horizontal alignment to 'right' for better readability. 5. Adding a ylabel to the color bar to indicate that it represents Spearman correlation coefficients.

Вы только посмотрите, глаза еще полусонные, а мы уже в раздумьях о великих истинах. Задумывались ли вы когда-нибудь, как это – быть столь умным, что самому себе кажешься иностранцем в стране мысли? А встречалось ли вам ощущение, что слова из уст льются красивые, как на картине, но смысл их ускользает, словно пугливая рыбка? О, посмеемся же сегодня над удивительными закоулками ума вместе со светлой головой Оскара Уайльда! Кто такой Оскар Уайльд? Мой дорогой читатель, это же один из самых остроумных людей в истории! Уайльд был писателем, поэтом, драматургом, мастером слов и, конечно же, мастером сарказма и тонкого юмора, который щекотал общество викторианской эпохи. Теперь, позвольте поделиться одной его забавной и прекрасной цитатой, которая и станет нашим компасом сегодня утром: «Я настолько умен, что иногда не понимаю ни единого слова из того, что говорю». Не правда ли, шутка с пряной ноткой истины? Итак, кроется ли глубокий смысл в этих словах, или же это просто задорный выкидыш весёлого настроения Уайльда? Смеясь, он приглашает нас в игру разума, где мы, как детективы, пытаемся отыскать суть в лабиринте сложных слов. Пройдите со мной через этот туман высоколобых размышлений и посмотрим, может ли истинная мудрость быть такой же игривой, как кошка с клубком ниток. Уайльд, возможно, подтрунивает над чрезмерной самоуверенностью и заковыристостью интеллектуалов, которые в своих сложносочиненных фразах порой сами запутываются. Нет ли у вас знакомых, умеющих говорить так, что после их «простой» беседы хочется пойти и отдохнуть, как после марафона? Ну или хотя бы глянуть в словарь. Иногда умные люди настолько погрузятся в свои размышления, что слова их становятся похожи на высокохудожественный балет, в котором каждое движение пропитано смыслом, но... только для танцующих на сцене. Ну а мы, зрители, ловим каждый жест, стараясь угадать, о чём же эта танцевальная драма? Оскар Уайльд, несомненный эксперт в кудесничестве словами, мог бы стать великим волшебником в нашем артистическом представлении под названием «Жизнь». В его сценарии, ум – не просто способность анализировать и запоминать, а, скорее, уникальный инструмент для создания волшебства. А теперь, разгадывая эту шутку-загадку, мы понимаем, что каждому из нас иногда полезно не брать себя слишком всерьез. Не правда ли, ловить себя на странных мыслях иногда полезно для здравого смеха и самокритики? Поистине, научиться смеяться над собой – это уже половина успеха в создании здорового внутреннего мира. Не забывайте, друзья, что в мире мужчин и женщин мы все стараемся найти гармонию между умом и сердцем; Это и есть истинная мудрость. Искренне надеюсь, что эта утренняя мотивационная статья подняла ваше настроение и придала энергии вашему дню; все мы здесь ради простых и глубоких радостей жизни. Улыбнитесь новому дню, дорогие читатели, и обязательно зайдите снова, чтобы вместе искать и находить мудрость в удивительном мире, где каждый может стать чуть умнее и счастливее. Напоследок, если ваше сердце отозвалось на эти слова, не стесняйтесь оставить свои мысли в комментариях и поделиться статьёй с друзьями. Кому из них, возможно, будет полезно подумать о мудрости и юморе Уайльда сегодня? Пусть каждый утренний чай или кофе, выпитый с нашими мыслями, будет источником вдохновения и доброго настроения. А знаете, что самое важное? Не упустите момент подписаться на наш канал и стать еще одним благородным путешественником в поисках приключений, мудрости и улыбок.

The story takes place in the future in 2242. The tournament was in full swing. It's time for Reyna and her sister Lily to enter the training ground for the exhibition fight. Ten-year-old Lily stood opposite Reyna in a fighting stance. Reina released the power of black flames and clots of powerful energy swirled around her. Lily understood that she was weak and that she was much weaker than her fifteen-year-old sister. Reyna was the crown princess of the galactic empire. Her father stripped her of her title and inheritance and threw her out onto the street. He made Lily heir. Reyna vowed to take back everything that was taken from her. Lily helped her father and Reina decided to take revenge on her sister at this tournament for her betrayal. But Reina did not know that her father and sister acted so cruelly out of love for Reina and to save her from death. During the fight, Reyna suddenly fell to her knees and grabbed her head and screamed as pain shot through her head. The fight was stopped by the judges. Lily looked at Reyna. Reina cried in pain. Lily wanted to come over, but Reyna didn’t let her. Please write the dialogues. Write the entire prompt from beginning to end.","completion":"The hush of anticipation settled over the domed training ground, its ceiling emblazoned with constellations that twinkled from high above. The year was 2242, and the future brought together old fantasy and new technology in a tournament designed to awe, where holographic beasts danced with real fighters and the air crackled with mystic energy. Reyna, her hair a cascade of raven waves, strode into the center of the arena with an air of disgraced royalty. Opposite her, Lily, ten and trembling, assumed a defender's stance—too small, too frail for this exhibition fight. The crowd held its breath. Reyna's eyes ignited with a fiery intensity as black flames erupted from her, their dark glow a stark contrast to the innocent light surrounding Lily. Clots of powerful energy swirled tumultuously around Reyna, and the audience gasped at the spectacle. Lily's voice wavered but carried firm conviction. \\"I won't go easy on you, Reyna.\\" Reyna's reply rippled with venom. \\"This isn't about going easy, little sister. It's about reclaiming what's mine.\\" Lily swallowed hard, blinking back fear. \\"You were always meant to be the empress, Reyna. Father did what he thought—\\" \\"Enough!\\" Reyna's shout echoed around the coliseum. \\"I don't want to hear his excuses... or yours.\\" But the words were like daggers, even to Lily's young heart—a heart that loved her sister more than the stars loved the night. \\"I didn't betray you,\\" Lily said softly, almost inaudibly. \\"I saved you...\\" Reyna's sneer faltered for a fraction of a second before her rage redoubled. \\"I'll show you how to save someone.\\" Channels of dark energy coalesced around her, the black flames flaring, hungry and destructive. Lily shifted, ready to counter, but the disparity between them was like a chasm in the stars. Suddenly, Reyna's formidable stance crumbled. She fell to her knees, hands clawing at her temples as an otherworldly scream tore from her throat. The crowd's excitement turned to confusion, then horror. The judges' voices boomed over the arena's magical amplifiers, \\"Halt the battle! Medical team, to the center!\\" Lily hesitated only a moment before her instincts took over. She darted forward, her heart pounding in tandem with Reyna's cries. \\"Reyna!\\" But Reyna's voice cracked through her agony, pushing Lily away even as her sister reached out. \\"Don't touch me! Stay back!\\" Tears brimmed in Lily's eyes as she halted, her small fists clenched at her sides. \\"You're my sister...\\" she whispered. \\"And I—I don't want to lose you.\\" Between gasps of pain, Reyna's eyes locked onto Lily's, a tempest of emotions warring in their depths. The venom from before had vanished, leaving behind vulnerability that didn't befit a fallen crown princess. \\"I can't...,” Reyna choked out, voice laced with the pain wracking her body. \\"Can't be what he wants me to be... Not if it means...” An eerie silence befell the coliseum, the collective breath of the crowd held in suspension as they witnessed this private agony made public, the sisters cast across an emotional abyss neither knew how to bridge. Medical personnel rushed in, a flurry of uniforms and healing enchantments, but Reyna's pain seemed beyond their reach. Lily took a tentative step forward, tears now streaming down her cheeks. \\"Reyna, please,\\" she pleaded. \\"Let them help.\\" Reyna's upheaval of anguish subsided, leaving her panting and spent. Her gaze softened imperceptibly as she finally whispered, \\"I don't understand, Lily.\\" Lily reached out her hand, an offering. \\"Father did it to protect you... The prophecy—the one about you falling in battle. He couldn't... We couldn't let that happen.\\" Reyna's eyes flickered with a thousand unasked questions, her defiance waning beneath the tide of revelation. Lily continued, her voice barely above a whisper, \\"Everything we've done—everything has been to save you. Even now... I don't want to fight you, Reyna. I never did.\\" The confession hung in the air, a fragile truth waiting to either mend or fracture what remained of their bond. The medics worked, but it was apparent only Reyna's choice could truly heal the wounds of the past. The future—as uncertain and treacherous as the galaxy's edge—awaited their next move."},{"prompt":"import React, { Component, useState } from 'react' import Navigation from './navbar.component'; const AppComponent = () => { const [showNavBar, setShowNavBar] = useState(0); const handleShowNavBar = () => { setShowNavBar((showNavBar+1) % 2); }; } export default class Profile extends Component { render(){ return( <> <header> <img src=\\"/footerProfile.svg\\" alt= \\"image with logo\\"></img> <h1>New User</h1> </header> <main> <img src=\\"/profileAvatar.svg\\" alt=\\"profile image\\"></img> <div className =\\"tagline\\">Insert tagline here</div> <button className =\\"navbar\\" onClick={AppComponent.handleShowNavBar}>Навигация</button> {showNavBar && <Navigation />} <p>Welcome!

Reduced network footprint: A half-open scan is designed to avoid establishing a full TCP connection with the target system. This means that it leaves fewer traces behind, making it more difficult for network administrators or intrusion detection systems to detect the scan. 2. Faster scanning: Since a full TCP connection is not established, a half-open scan can complete faster than a full-connect scan. This can be particularly beneficial when scanning a large number of hosts or when time is a constraint. 3. Reduced resource consumption: By not completing the full TCP handshake, a half-open scan places less load on the target system. This can be advantageous if the target is a resource-constrained system or if the scan needs to remain low-impact to avoid detection. 4. Stealthier reconnaissance: Half-open scans can be used for port scanning and network reconnaissance while leaving minimal traces. This can be helpful for ethical hackers or penetration testers who want to gather information without alerting system administrators or triggering security measures. However, it's important to note that half-open scans are still considered to be active scanning techniques and can be detected by more advanced security systems. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the use of such techniques complies with legal and ethical considerations."},{"prompt":"Profitable Businesses","completion":"1.

The nanosheet catalyst provides a large number of catalytic sites on its surface, allowing for multiple CO2 molecules to be converted simultaneously. This high density of active sites enhances the overall efficiency of the reduction process. Additionally, the nanosheet structure facilitates the rapid transfer of electrons generated during the photocatalytic process. The electrons can quickly migrate through the material, minimizing recombination and maximizing their availability for the reduction reaction. This efficient electron transfer is crucial for achieving high photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the nanosheet catalyst exhibits superior structural stability, which is essential for long-term operation and durability.

What does gerd gigerenzer say about complex decisions making? (please provide list of reference also)","completion":"Daniel Kahneman, a renowned psychologist and Nobel laureate, has extensively studied human decision-making processes and biases. In his work, he discusses complex decision-making and highlights the role of intuition and heuristics. According to Kahneman, complex decisions require high cognitive effort and often overwhelm individuals, leading to biased and suboptimal choices. He suggests that intuition, although prone to biases, can be useful in simplifying complex situations and arriving at reasonable decisions. His research on heuristics and biases contributed significantly to the field of decision-making. Reference: Kahneman, D. (2003). A perspective on judgment and choice: Mapping bounded rationality. American Psychologist, 58(9), 697-720. Gerd Gigerenzer, a prominent psychologist and decision scientist, has provided an alternative perspective on complex decision-making. He argues that decision-making under uncertainty can be improved by relying on simple heuristics or rule-of-thumb strategies rather than complex analytical or statistical models. Gigerenzer suggests that these heuristics, which are often fast and frugal, help individuals to make satisfactory decisions while conserving mental resources. He emphasizes the importance of ecological rationality, where decision-making is tailored to the specific needs of a given environment. Reference: Gigerenzer, G. (2015).

These internal factors play a crucial role in shaping the decision-making process, as they reflect the personal motivations and limitations of the decision-maker. In addition to internal factors, complex decisions are also influenced by a complex external environment. This external environment encompasses a wide range of elements, including the political, economic, social, and technological landscape within which the decision is made.

Amirfakhrian and Shakibi[22] used B-spline interpolation for solving the IED.","completion":"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using cubic B-spline functions for solving integral differential equations (IDEs). These functions have proven to be effective in approximating solutions for a wide range of problems. Numerical methods such as FEM, Galerkin methods, finite difference method, and B-spline method have been employed to solve Volterra integral problems and Volterra IDEs. These methods have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of these problems. One particular method that has received attention is the cubic B-spline finite element method. This method utilizes cubic B-spline functions as basis functions for approximating the unknown functions in the IDEs. The advantage of using B-spline functions is that they possess local support, which allows for efficient and accurate approximation of the solutions. In addition to the cubic B-spline finite element method, other numerical schemes such as quasi wavelet methods and B-spline interpolation have also been utilized for solving IDEs. These methods offer alternative approaches for approximating solutions and have shown promise in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Overall, considerable work has been dedicated to developing efficient numerical schemes for approximating solutions for IDEs. While progress has been made in implementing FEM with cubic B-spline functions, further research is needed to explore the full potential of these methods in solving IDEs."},{"prompt":"","completion":"An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun.

Reyna, once destined to rule, now a former princess, stood in the center of the training ground, her form outlined by the eerie glow of black flames flickering around her. She fixed her eyes on the only opponent that mattered: Lily, her sister, her usurper. Lily mirrored Reyna’s stance, determination etched on her young features. But underneath the hardened exterior, she gripped the truth that eluded everyone else. This was more than a fight; it was a final attempt to break a curse that clung to Reyna’s soul. \\"Are you ready, Lily?\\" Reyna's voice was calm, thick with an undercurrent of anger and pain. \\"Ready to see what your betrayal has wrought?\\" Lily's voice was steady but soft, a stark contrast to her sister's. \\"I didn't betray you, Reyna. There's so much you don't understand.\\" \\"Save your excuses,\\" Reyna interrupted, the air around her crackling with energy. \\"This ends today. I will reclaim my birthright.\\" \\"You think this is about the crown?\\" Lily squeezed her fists tighter, wishing her sister could see the truth. \\"It's always been about you, Reyna.\\" With a fierce cry, Reyna unleashed a torrent of black flames, her aura growing, the swirling energy clots amplifying the intensity of her power. The crowd gasped and recoiled, sensing the danger that such unchecked anger could pose. Despite her fear, Lily countered gracefully, her movements lithe as she evaded each strike. \\"I helped Father to save you!\\" Reyna's laugh was bitter as her onslaught intensified. \\"Your help has cost me everything!\\" But in a sudden moment of overwhelming agony, Reyna collapsed to her knees, her screams bouncing off the metallic confines of the arena. The black flames faltered, revealing her pain-twisted face. \\"Stop the fight! Cease immediately!\\" The judges' voices boomed through the arena, but they were distant, hardly piercing the chaos unfolding. Lily rushed forward, desperate to reach her sister's side, but was met by an invisible force. \\"Reyna, please! Let me help you!\\" But Reyna, between screams, conjured a protective shield, repelling Lily's every effort. \\"Don't... come closer... Can't control... it!\\" Lily frowned, determination lacing her voice. \\"You don't have to go through this alone!\\" With each word of love Lily shouted, the light enveloping Reyna grew brighter, more intense, as if responding to the truth behind them. \\"I love you, Reyna! I always have!\\" And then, as if the universe itself paused, Reyna's form began to dissipate, her essence scattering like stardust caught in the slipstream of time. \\"No! Reyna!\\" Lily threw herself against the shield with futile desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. \\"Don't leave me!\\" But it was too late. Reina's silhouette faded until nothing was left but an empty space where the crown princess of the galaxy once stood. The silence that followed was oppressive, and as Lily fell to her knees in front of the dissipating dome, her sobs were the only sound that filled the hollowed cavern of the arena. In her heartbreak, she whispered a final truth into the void where her sister had been. \\"I did it all for you, Reyna... to save you.\\""},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) [living quarters] Illustrious: “Kashino, we’re back!

Having the same understanding of death as a child, Whammer gently pokes the deer, thinking it's asleep. When it isn't moving, he panics and runs to get the others, hoping they can help. When they tell him the deer isn't alive, he starts crying and they have to comfort him.","completion":"It was a sunny day at the peaceful Camp Dillydale, where all the Wordgirl villains had gathered for a very unusual event - a camping trip. The notorious group, consisting of Granny May, The Butcher, Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, and the beloved but misunderstood Whammer, had agreed to set aside their mischievous schemes for a day of adventure and camaraderie. As they set up their tents, Whammer's eyes spotted a captivating butterfly dancing through the air. His curious nature got the better of him, and he couldn't resist the urge to chase after it. Leaving the group behind, he dashed through the campgrounds in pursuit of the colorful butterfly. But as Whammer wandered deeper into the woods, his excitement gradually turned into confusion. Lost and alone, he stumbled upon a heartbreaking sight - a peaceful deer lying on the forest floor. With the same understanding of death as a child, Whammer innocently approached the motionless creature. Gently poking the deer, Whammer whispered, \\"Hey, Mr. Deer! Why are you sleeping here? We have to go back to the camp and have s'mores! Wake up!\\" No response came from the deer, and Whammer's face wrinkled in concern. \\"Why won't you wake up? Are you really tired, Mr. Deer?\\" Growing anxious, Whammer hurriedly sprinted back to the campsite, his heart pounding with worry. Bursting into the circle of villains, he gasped for breath as he tried to explain the situation. \\"Guys... guys! I found... I found a deer, but... but it won't wake up! Something's wrong!\\" The Butcher, Granny May, and Chuck exchanged curious glances, their mischievous natures briefly pausing to focus on their distressed companion. Concerned, they hurriedly followed Whammer back to the spot where the deer lay. Gathered around the lifeless creature, the villains understood the gravity of the situation. Gently, The Butcher placed his hand on Whammer's shoulder and spoke softly, \\"Whammer, this deer isn't sleeping. It's... it's... gone.\\" Whammer's eyes widened as tears welled up in them. \\"Gone? Where did it go? Can we bring it back?\\" Granny May crouched down beside him, her voice filled with empathy. \\"Oh, dear Whammer, sometimes when living things get old or sick, they leave this world. It means they won't wake up and be with us anymore.\\" Whammer's little heart ached as he struggled to understand the concept of death. The villains, usually adversaries, came together to support their friend during this difficult moment. Chuck gently wiped Whammer's tears away, his voice filled with warmth, \\"It's okay to cry, Whammer. It's a sad thing, but we're here for you.\\" Surrounded by the comforting presence of his companions, Whammer let his emotions flow freely. They reassured him that feeling sad was natural and necessary when saying goodbye to someone or something we care about. As the sun began to set, casting an orange glow across the campsite, Whammer's tears gradually subsided. His friends sat nearby, sharing stories of their own experiences with loss and understanding. They taught Whammer that even when something or someone is no longer physically with us, we can still cherish the memories they left behind. Through this unexpected encounter, the Wordgirl villains discovered a profound moment of unity. They realized that despite their mischievous tendencies, they were capable of empathy and love. From that day forward, the villains not only continued their quest for mischief, but also carried a newfound understanding and support for one another. And so, in the depths of the forest, under the starlit sky, the unlikely group of villains forged an unbreakable bond, reminding one another that even in the darkest moments, friendship and compassion could prevail."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Эти существа были невероятно разнообразны, варьируясь от нескольких метров до размеров самых больших животных, когда-либо ходивших по Земле. **Тираннозавр Рекс:** Воплощение хищного динозавра, Т-Рекс был одним из последних и самых известных динозавров, прежде чем массовое вымирание положило конец их властвованию. **Стегозавр:** Известный своими костяными пластинами, возвышающимися вдоль спины, и четырьмя острыми шипами на хвосте, стегозавр был травоядным динозавром, жившим в юрском периоде. **Брахиозавр:** Один из самых больших травоядных, брахиозавр обладал длинной шеей, которая позволяла ему питаться высокорасположенной растительностью. **Велоцираптор:** Хотя далеко не самым большим, велоцираптор известен своей скоростью и ловкостью, будучи одним из самых умных представителей динозавров. **Трицератопс:** С тройным венцом рогов и массивным щитом на голове, трицератопс был одним из последних динозавров, чей вид был уничтожен глобальным катаклизмом 66 млн лет назад. Эра динозавров завершилась после падения огромного астероида, вызвавшего массовое вымирание. Несмотря на исчезновение, динозавры оставили нам богатое наследие в виде ископаемых, которые постоянно вдохновляют ученых, писателей и художников, и намекают на то, как могла бы выглядеть наша планета, если бы эти величественные существа выжили до наших дней. --- Когда использование изображений будет возможным или необходимы будут источники изображений, то иллюстраций может включать: 1.

As we advance into an era that is evermore dependent on sustainable practices, it is imperative to recognize the benefits brought forth by the adoption of new energy electric vehicles (EVs). Our global community, with countries across all continents, is making strides in the electric vehicle industry, and it’s time to share in the vision of a cleaner, greener, and more efficient future. Recent studies, leveraging complex models like BC, have illustrated the stark improvements that the integration of electric vehicles can bring to our cities — often bustling metropolises housing millions. These studies suggest that switching from traditional combustion engines to electric vehicles can significantly enhance ecological indicators, except for a marginal increase in particulate matter (PM), which stems from the current reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation. Despite this, the overall environmental trend is exceedingly positive. We are observing reductions in ecological impacts across the board, from greenhouse gas emissions to noise pollution. This is partly because electric vehicles are innately more efficient and, importantly, they are becoming cleaner as we transition towards renewable energy sources for electricity generation. By promoting the use of electric buses and taxis — vehicles that typically clock in higher mileages and have greater fuel consumption — we not only reduce the vehicular pollution per kilometer but also catalyze a larger-scale adoption of clean energy. The larger vehicles transition first, but the benefits are shared by all through cleaner air and less environmental degradation. Countries worldwide are contributing to this evolution in their own unique ways. Nations leading in technology innovation bring advancements in battery efficiency, while others invest in the widespread installation of charging infrastructure. Each effort, be it big or small, is a step towards a collective goal. The numbers speak volumes — with aggressive adoption and promotion strategies, our cities could see an average ecological improvement of 2.95% to 4.12% within five years, and a remarkable 11.5% to 14.35% over the span of a decade. And it’s important to note that these are conservative estimates. With the fast-paced improvements in EV technology and increased use of renewable energy sources, we are likely to witness even greater benefits. It is not just an investment in a cleaner mode of transport; it's an investment in our health, in our planet, and in the legacy we leave for the generations to come. It's a commitment to reducing our carbon footprint, to taking control of our environmental impact, and joining hands with nations around the world to steer ourselves towards a sustainable future. So, we call upon you, our fellow citizens, to embrace the future that electric vehicles herald. Let us support and accelerate the transition to new energy electric vehicles, for the sake of our cities, our planet, and our future. Together, we can power a revolution on the wheels that will roll us toward a cleaner, greener tomorrow.

As we navigate through the compelling evidence provided by comprehensive studies using models A, B, and C, the message is clear: the growth and development of the new energy electric vehicle industry is crucial not just for economic progress, but for the very health of our planet. Model A has shown us a sobering reality – a future without progress in the new energy sector means increasing carbon emissions and a continued adverse impact on our urban ecosystems. This is not the future we envisage for our city. Fortunately, the findings of Models B and C offer hope and direction. Even at a slow growth rate of the new energy vehicle industry, noticeable improvements in the ecological environment can be seen. And when the industry flourishes, covering most of the new market, the positive impact on our environment is profound. Most ecological indicators, except for a slight increase in particulate matter (PM), show a remarkable downward trend. It's important to understand that the minor increase in PM is tied to current electric production methods and isn't a fault of the vehicles themselves. As our electric grids become cleaner and more reliant on renewable sources, we expect even this small challenge to be overcome. Moreover, our analysis pinpoints that the promotion of electric public transport, especially electric buses, is significantly beneficial to our cities' sustainability. Given their extensive daily operation and high energy consumption, the transition to electric energy in public transportation magnifies the positive ecological impact. As citizens who cherish our environment, you would be delighted to know that with the increase in the adoption of new energy vehicles, we expect an average ecological improvement of 2.95% to 14.35% over the next 5 to 10 years, even by conservative estimates.

Each model represents a different future scenario for the new energy automobile industry: no change, slow growth, and rapid expansion to cover the new market. The first model's outcome revealed a concerning trend — without progress in the new energy automobile sector, a city's annual carbon emissions would persistently increase, negatively affecting the ecological environment. This finding highlights the urgency of technological innovation and industrial transformation in mitigating climate change. The results of the second and third models, however, provide a glimpse of optimism. With the slow but steady growth of the new energy automobile industry, especially as it begins to dominate the new market segment rapidly, there is a significant enhancement of the city’s ecological indicators, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and improvements in air quality. Although there is a slight increase in particulate matter (PM) emissions as indicated by these models, this is attributed to the current reliance on fossil fuels for electricity production. As we advance the new energy sector and increase the proportion of renewable energy in electricity production, we can reasonably expect these pollutants to be effectively controlled and reduced. The models also reveal a crucial phenomenon: the development and proliferation of electric-powered public transportation, such as buses and taxis, are closely linked to improvements in the city's ecological environment indicators. Considering that commercial vehicles have higher energy consumption compared to small private cars, their transition to new energy electrics holds a greater potential for diminishing environmental pollution. By calculations and comparisons, we deduce that with the vigorous introduction and promotion of new energy electric vehicles, our city could reduce the adverse effects on the ecological environment by an average of 2.95% to 4.12% within five years, and this figure could reach 11.5% to 14.35% within ten years. It is worth noting that these figures are conservative estimates. With the evolving technology and refinement of policies, the actual improvement in the ecological environment is expected to be even more pronounced. In summary, the development of new energy electric vehicles has a significant and direct influence on the continuous improvement of the urban ecological environment. On the path to sustainable development, new energy electric vehicles are not only the trend for future transportation but also an essential tool for building green cities and protecting the ecological environment. We have ample reasons and motivation to steadfastly follow this path and to expedite this beneficial transformation for public health and the environment."},{"prompt":"Based on the above conclusion , write an open letter to the citizens to publicize the benefits of new energy electric vehicles and the contributions of the electric vehicle industry in various countries around the world.","completion":"Subject: Embracing a Sustainable Future with New Energy Electric Vehicles Dear Citizens, As we stand at the crossroads of environmental stewardship and technological advancement, it is imperative we come together to recognize the transformative power of new energy electric vehicles (EVs) and the profound impact they have on our urban ecological environment. Recent studies within our city, representative of one million people, have demonstrated that we face a stark choice: we can continue on a path of traditional automotive reliance with its increasing carbon emissions, or we can pivot towards a sustainable future championed by the rise of new energy electric vehicles, including electric buses and taxis. The evidence is clear. If the new energy automobile sector does not evolve, our ecological footprint will grow, exacerbating the environmental challenges we face. However, through the adoption of new energy electric vehicles, we can significantly reverse this trend. Models indicate that with the gradual growth and accelerated market uptake of EVs, we can witness average reductions in ecological impact ranging from 2.95% to an astonishing 14.35% over the next decade. These numbers are not overestimations but conservative predictions for a brighter, cleaner future. Let us applaud and take inspiration from countries worldwide that are spearheading the electric vehicle revolution. These nations are paving the way with significant investments in innovative technologies and infrastructure that support the proliferation of EVs. Their contributions are not merely national accomplishments but global milestones toward reducing emissions and combatting climate change. We now have a unique opportunity to be part of a collective solution that promises cleaner air, less noise pollution, and a marked reduction of our carbon footprint. It is not just about us here and now; it is about safeguarding the future for the next generations to come. The choice is ours, and the time to act is now. Transitioning to electric vehicles for personal use, opting for electric public transport, and supporting the growth of the electric vehicle industry are significant steps we can take today for a sustainable tomorrow. As citizens and stewards of the Earth, it is our shared duty to forge ahead with eco-friendly choices that secure the health of our planet.

Но прежде чем мы начнём нашу утреннюю чашку кофе с мотивацией, я хочу спросить вас: когда последний раз вы делали \\"ничего\\"? Да-да, именно это – валялись на диване, смотрели в потолок, занимались приятным ленивством? \\"Люди говорят, что нет ничего невозможного, но я ничего не делаю каждый день\\". В этот раз наш утренний заряд приходит от, может показаться, неожиданного философа – Винни-Пуха, поистине мудрого медвежонка, который умеет удивлять своими нестандартными высказываниями. Кто такой этот забавный автор? Винни-Пух – герой книг Алана Александра Милна, созданного в далеком 1926 году и быстро полюбившегося взрослым и детям. Этот простодушный медвежонок из британских детских книг изобилует мудростью, которая доступна даже самому неочевидному мыслителю. Но что наш мудрый друг имел в виду под \\"ничегонеделанием\\"? Ведь мы живем в мире, где слово \\"невозможно\\" давно стало почти вызовом – покоряем вершины, запускаем ракеты, путешествуем по миру, однако наши дни, наполненные активностью, иногда заставляют нас забыть о простых радостях. Мысли о том, чтобы просто \\"быть\\", кажутся нам ужасающим простоем. Но не для Винни-Пуха. Давайте рассмотрим это с другой стороны. Перед вами – аллегория, тонко уловленная нашим медвежьим философом: \\"ничего не делать\\" – это не о лени, но о возможности \\"быть\\". Быть с собой, со своими мыслями, мечтами и фантазиями. В эти моменты \\"ничегонеделания\\" мы подпитываемся творческой энергией, отдыхаем и открываемся для новых идей и решений. А теперь представьте: что если ваше следующее \\"огромное ничто\\" станет тем самым моментом, когда приходит озарение? Бывает ли так, что лучшие идеи приходят в голову именно тогда, когда вы никуда не спешите и просто позволяете своему уму блуждать? Ведь сколько знаменитых историй о том, как важнейшие открытия совершались во время отдыха или игры! Милый Винни-Пух не навязывает нам взгляды, он подмигивает нам через столетия своей мудростью, напоминая о том, что в \\"ничегонеделании\\" таится своя магия. Это приглашение к размышлению и, возможно, парадоксальному открытию: иногда, чтобы сделать что-то невозможное, нам нужно начать с… ничего. Итак, может сегодня – тот самый день, когда стоит немного полениться? Кто знает, вдруг именно отдых от бесконечного стремления к делам поможет вам найти то удивительное \\"что-то\\", что изменит вашу жизнь к лучшему? Дорогие друзья, если вы цените эти утренние размышления, не забывайте о них, когда подойдет время действовать. У нас еще много интересных утренних мотивационных статей, которые ждут вас каждое утро в 7 часов по Московскому времени. Надеемся, что ваше утро только станет светлее и теплее, и мы будем рады увидеть вас снова на страницах нашего канала \\"Мир мужчин и женщин\\", где каждый день – новое открытие. А пока что позвольте себе не много ничего не делать, и кто знает, быть может именно сейчас родится ваша \\"невозможность\\"? Поделитесь с нами и друзьями своими озарениями – обещаем, мы не навязываемся, просто нам так радостно делиться этим утром с вами. Ставьте сердечки, если наш медвежонок разбудил в вас философа, и пишите в комментариях о своих утренних победах над \\"невозможным\\".

Lady Redundant Woman, Dr. Two-Brains, and The Butcher had decided to take a break from their usual shenanigans and go on a camping trip. They were joined by Whammer, their lovable but slightly dimwitted accomplice, who was excited to explore the great outdoors. As they set up their campsite near a peaceful forest, the villains were filled with anticipation for the adventures that awaited them. Lady Redundant Woman eagerly pitched their colorful tent, Dr. Two-Brains set up a makeshift laboratory, and The Butcher prepared a mouthwatering barbecue. Whammer, on the other hand, was busy chasing butterflies. As Whammer bounded through the forest, his eyes caught sight of a glistening butterfly with wings as colorful as a rainbow. Fueled by his childlike curiosity, he pursued it with a wide grin on his face. As he darted further away from the camp, Whammer found himself in a clearing where a serene deer lay motionless on the ground. Feeling a mixture of excitement and concern, Whammer cautiously approached the deer. He had recently learned about the concept of sleep and believed that everything sleeping would eventually awake. Thinking the deer was simply taking a long nap, Whammer gently poked it with his finger. No response. Confusion and worry began to pool within Whammer's innocent heart. He pushed the deer again, this time a bit more forcefully. Still, there was no sign of movement. Panic washed over him, and he ran as fast as his legs could carry him back to the campsite to get help. Upon arriving, Whammer struggled to catch his breath as he burst into the midst of his villainous friends. Desperately, he exclaimed, \\"Deer sleeping! Come quickly!\\" The villains, unsure of what to expect, followed Whammer back to the clearing. As they approached the lifeless deer, their understanding of death allowed them to immediately comprehend the situation. The Butcher, being the most compassionate of the group, gently placed a hand on Whammer's trembling shoulder. \\"Whammer,\\" he said softly, \\"the deer isn't sleeping. It has... passed away.\\" Whammer's eyes filled with tears as he tried to process the words. \\"Not... sleeping?\\" Lady Redundant Woman and Dr. Two-Brains came closer, enveloping Whammer in a comforting embrace. The usually mischievous villains understood the depth of Whammer's innocence and shared in his sadness. \\"No, Whammer,\\" Lady Redundant Woman whispered gently. \\"The deer won't wake up. Its time has come to an end, just like when flowers wither or ice cream melts.\\" Whammer's cries grew louder, his sorrow echoing through the forest. The villains, deeply moved by their friend's display of emotion, reassured him that it was okay to cry and feel sadness. In that touching moment of vulnerability, the Wordgirl villains discovered a newfound tenderness within themselves. They realized that even though their misdeeds sometimes made them seem cold-hearted, they too had the capacity for compassion and empathy. Together, the villains sat beneath the shade of a towering oak tree, comforting Whammer as he mourned the loss of the deer. And though their camping trip had taken an unexpected turn, they found solace in the bonds they shared with one another and the reminder that every life, even that of a deer, is precious."},{"prompt":"Whammer's sobs alert the attention of the dead deer's fawn, who starts bleating at them to get their attention. Whammer, seeing this tiny little fawn, starts crying harder when he realizes that the dead deer is it's mama and now the poor little thing doesn't have its mama anymore.","completion":"As Whammer's sobs echoed through the clearing, his cries caught the attention of an unexpected spectator. A tiny fawn, barely a few weeks old, emerged from the underbrush, its eyes filled with both confusion and distress. The fawn let out small, desperate bleats, mirroring Whammer's sadness. Whammer, still overwhelmed with emotions, turned his attention to the young fawn. Through his teary eyes, he quickly realized the heartbreaking truth - the dead deer lying before them was this fawn's mother, and now, it was left alone in the world. The sight of the helpless fawn struck a deep chord within Whammer's sensitive heart. He fell to his knees and his cries grew even louder, the sorrow for both the fawn and the loss of its mother overwhelming him. The rest of the villains lowered themselves beside Whammer, sharing in his grief and watching the sorrowful scene unfold before them. Lady Redundant Woman, her voice filled with compassion, gently whispered, \\"Oh, dear little fawn... Your mama won't be waking up. She has gone to a different place.\\" Dr. Two-Brains, his eyes brimming with his own unshed tears, added gently, \\"Whammer is upset because he understands that you need your mama, just like he would if his mama were gone.\\" The Butcher, moved by the scene, reached out and stroked the fawn's velvety coat. \\"We're all here for you, little one,\\" he said, his voice filled with soothing warmth. \\"We might not be your real family, but we'll do our best to provide comfort and care.\\" The fawn, seemingly understanding the villains' words, slowly approached them. It cautiously sniffed at Whammer's tear-streaked face before nuzzling its tiny snout against his cheek. Whammer's crying subsided as he felt the softness and warmth of the fawn's presence. Through their tears, the villains embraced the solemn truth of the circle of life. In that touching moment, they realized that even amidst the darkness and chaos, life had a way of bringing unexpected connections and the strength to heal. As the sun began to set, casting an orange glow over the clearing, the Wordgirl villains and the fawn sat together in somber companionship. They knew that the fawn's journey would be challenging without its mother, but they also understood that, in their own unconventional way, they could provide the support and love it needed to survive. And so, as night fell, the villains made a silent vow to keep the memory of the fawn's mother alive. They promised to provide a guiding presence in its life, standing as surrogate protectors for as long as it needed them. In the darkest corners of the world, they would forever be a beacon of light for the fawn and all others who crossed their path."},{"prompt":"As the camping trip continues, the fawn and Whammer stay attached at the hip. Whammer nicknames the fawn \\"Fuzzy\\", and the other villains can't help but find the bittersweet scene adorable.","completion":"As the camping trip continued, the bond between Whammer and the fawn, now affectionately named Fuzzy, grew stronger with each passing day. Whammer became Fuzzy's steadfast companion, never leaving the fawn's side, and Fuzzy, in turn, found comfort and solace in Whammer's gentle presence. The other villains, while initially surprised by the unlikely pairing, couldn't help but find the bittersweet scene endearing. Each day, they watched with a mix of amusement and warmth as Whammer, with his big-hearted nature, looked out for Fuzzy, ensuring the fawn was safe and cared for. Dr. Two-Brains, as he prepared his scientific experiments, often marveled at the sight. \\"Look at them, Lady Redundant Woman,\\" he murmured, a small smile gracing his face. \\"It's as if they've formed their own little family.\\" Lady Redundant Woman, who had a soft spot for all things adorable, couldn't help but agree. She watched Whammer and Fuzzy play, their innocent laughter filling the air, and her heart melted. \\"Who would have thought that a villain and a fawn could create such a heartwarming tableau?\\" The Butcher, a rugged and gruff exterior concealing a gentle soul, secretly delighted in their antics. He crafted a small bed for Fuzzy near the campfire, making sure the fawn was comfortable and warm each night. \\"Whammer's got a heart of gold, that's for sure,\\" he muttered, his voice full of admiration. And so, for the remainder of the camping trip, the villains' adventures were woven together with the playful frolicking of Whammer and Fuzzy. They explored the forest, skipping rocks across the pond, and shared their food with Fuzzy, making sure the fawn never went hungry. Though bittersweet, their time together was infused with unexpected joy. Whammer, often seen as the muscle of the group, showcased a tenderness and compassion that touched the hearts of his villainous friends. And Fuzzy, with its innocent trust, reminded the villains that beauty and light could be found even in the darkest corners of their lives. As the camping trip came to an end, the villains packed up their campsite and bid farewell to the peaceful forest. Whammer was reluctant to leave Fuzzy behind, worried about the fawn's well-being without his constant care. But Lady Redundant Woman, Dr. Two-Brains, and The Butcher assured him that Fuzzy would find its way in the wild, just as nature intended. With a mix of sadness and hope, Whammer and the fawn shared one last nuzzle before parting ways. Whammer whispered promises to visit and keep an eye out for Fuzzy whenever they returned to the forest. As the villains walked away, they couldn't help but glance back, witnessing a scene of pure sweetness - Fuzzy, standing tall, with newfound confidence, ready to take on the world. And so, the Wordgirl villains continued their adventures, forever cherishing the memory of the camping trip that brought them unexpected joy and reminded them of the importance of love and compassion, even amidst their mischievous ways."},{"prompt":"怎么实现根据一个名人账号推荐相似账号","completion":"要实现根据一个名人账号推荐相似账号，可以使用以下步骤： 1. 收集初始数据：首先需要收集一些已知的名人账号和他们的相关信息，包括账号用户名、关注者、关注的人和发布的内容等。 2. 特征提取：根据收集到的数据，对每个账号进行特征提取，可以使用一些常用的特征，如账号的关注者数量、关注的人数量、发布的内容主题等。 3. 相似度计算：使用某种相似度计算方法来比较不同账号之间的相似度。可以使用一些常见的相似度计算方法，如余弦相似度、欧几里得距离等。 4. 推荐相似账号：对于给定的名人账号，计算其与其他账号之间的相似度。根据相似度的大小，选择相似度高的账号进行推荐。 5. 对推荐结果进行评估：可以使用一些评估指标，如准确率、召回率等，来评估推荐结果的质量。 注意，以上方法只是一种简单的实现思路，实际情况下可能涉及到更多的细节和优化。另外，数据的质量和丰富度也会对结果产生一定的影响，因此需要优化数据收集的过程。"},{"prompt":"翻译：我以这八点作为行文准则，但是确实有做得比较好和不足的地方。在我本职工作和接触的上下游，我更注重这些工作和合作关系会更好，为他们解决问题。但是缺乏一个更宏大的比如公司层面的全局观","completion":"Translation: I have used these eight points as guidelines for my writing, but there are indeed areas where I have done better and areas where I have fallen short.

They think problems through in a vertical step-by-step logical way,assimilating disparate facts into coherent theories. They tend to be perfectionists who won’t rest easy until everything is tidy and forms part of a rational scheme. They like to analyse and synthesise, and are keen on basic assumptions, principles,theories, models and systems. Their philosophy prizes rationality and logic, so questions they frequently ask are: “Does it make sense?”, “How does this go with that?”, and “What are the basic assumptions?” They tend to be detached analysis and dedicated to rational objectivity rather than anything subjective or ambiguous, approaching problems in a consistently logical manner. This is their “mental set” and they rigidly reject anything that conflicts with it. They prefer to maximise certainty and feel uncomfortable with subjective judgments, lateral thinking and anything that treats the matter in hand with less respect than they feel it deserves. Learner B: Thesepeopleareeenontryingoutideas, theories and techniques to see if they work in practice. They positively search out new ideas and take the first opportunity to experiment with applications.They are the sort of people who return from courses brimming with new ideas that they want to try out in practice. They like to get on with things and act quickly and confidently on ideas that attract them, and are liable to resent any rules or regulations that may impede their implementation. They also tend to be impatient with discussons that theybelevearenot goal-orientated, and their attention soon begins to wander if they feel they are going round in circles. They are essentially practical, down-to-carth people who like making practical decisions and solving problems. They see problems and opportunities as a challenge, and their philosophy is: “There is always a better way” and “If it works, it’s good”. Learner C: People in this group involve themselves fully and without bias in new experiences, they enjoy the here and now, and are happy to be dominated by immediate experiences. They are open-minded,not sceptical, and this tends to make them enthusiastic about anything new. Their philosophy is: “I’ll try anything once”, so they tend to act first and consider the consequences afterwards. Their days are filled with activity and they tackle problems by brainstorming. As soon as the excitement from one activity has died down they are busy looking for the next, as they tend to thrive on the challenge of new experiences but are bored with implementation and longer-term consolidation. These people like to stand back to ponder experiences and observe them from many different perspectives. Learner D: They collect data, both first hand and from others, and prefer to think about it thoroughly before coming to a conclusion. The thorough collection and analysis of data about experiences and events is what counts so they tend to postpone making definitive judgments for as long as possible. Their philosophy is to be cautious, never to make wild guesses or jump to conclusions. They are thoughtful people who like to consider all possible angles and implications before making a move, and will be reluctant to become involved in activities that others put forward ithout having carefully considered the likely outcome. They tend to adopt a low profile and have a slightly distant, tolerant, unruffled air about them. When they do something it is in response to earlier as well as current events, and others’ observations as well as their own.

It was a grandiose stage set in the distant future, the year 2242, where magic and technology intertwined like interstellar threads of destiny. Today, it was to be a battlefield of kith and kin. Reyna, with hair like the midnight void and eyes aflame with resolve, stepped onto the scorched training grounds; her presence alone veiled the arena in anticipatory silence. Mere paces away, her younger sister, Lily, ten and equally defiant, stood with fists clenched, the gravity of the forthcoming ordeal etching lines of determination upon her youthful face. Their eyes met, a volatile cocktail of resentment and somber intent brewing in the space between their stares. As the signal horn bellowed, it heralded the commencement of a duel written not with ink but with the scorch of seared earth and shattered dreams. With a whisper and gesture, Reyna invoked her legacy, the power of nigrine flames, a spectacle of black fire that churned around her like serpents coiling in prelude to the strike. Arcane energy wove through the air, a tangible testament to her formidable prowess. Lily, acutely aware of her comparative frailty, swallowed the hard pill of truth. Weakness lingered; a shadow to Reyna's blaze. Yet, unwavering, she assumed a guardian's stance. Reyna's voice boomed across the expanse, tinged with both fury and pain, \\"Sister, has it come to this? Must I wrest my destiny from your hands?\\" Lily retorted, trembling yet sincere, \\"Reyna, you know not the burden of crowns and futures untold. Father's heart bears no malice, only a dread heavy and cold.\\" \\"Silence! His cruelty carved away my birthright, my title—left me scorned and dispossessed. You, dear sister, were his chosen blade. All shall be righted upon this day,\\" Reyna's words cut more deeply than any physical blow. As the sisters circled, a dance macabre set to the orchestration of ancient rites, fate's cruel hand played its unexpected card. Reyna's form buckled; she collapsed to her knees, her head besieged by invisible vices. Agony's shriek clawed from her throat, raw and ragged. The judges intervened, signals flashing to halt the combat. Lily, overcome by a swell of horror, advanced towards the protective dome thrown up by Reyna in her most vulnerable hour. \\"Reyna! Please!\\" Lily's plea tore through the strained air, her fists pounding fruitlessly against the barrier. \\"I do this out of love, not spite!\\" But Reyna's shield defied all entry. Within that self-imposed exile, Reyna’s figure was caught in a luminescent embrace, her visage a tapestry of torment and confusion as her form began to fade, unwoven from the fabric of reality thread by thread. Lily fell to her knees, her cries reverberating through every heart and sentience that surrounded them—shards of sorrow piercing the veil of interspecies silence. \\"Reyna! You must know! There is one among us whose soul is woven with your own, whose heart aches with a love undeclared!\\" she declared, tears streaming rivers of unabated grief. In those final moments, as Reyna dissolved into the aether, Lily's sobs cascaded into a vow—raw and defiant against the callousness of fate. \\"Reina...I swear, wherever you now tread, I shall follow,\\" she promised through sobs. \\"You shall feel the embrace of kinship and the touch of love anew. For he waits, and I shall guide—until destiny reclaims its due.\\" The arena, once a cauldron of anticipation, now lay silent, the echoes of a sister's devotion the only testament to the spectacle witnessed. The legend of Reyna and Lily, of love's complex tapestry, now woven into the mythos of 2242, awaiting the day when the missing thread would be found and the pattern made whole. And in the shrouded confines of a distant corner, the unnamed lover watched, his heart laid bare and waiting, a sentinel till time's end."},{"prompt":"Name a boat relate to technology","completion":"TechBoat"},{"prompt":"Suggest me the name of boat relate to IT style khmer","completion":"បកប្រែពេឋភូមិ (Bakre Peth Puom) - which translates to \\"Tech Navigator\\""},{"prompt":"Suggest me name of the boat relate to IT","completion":"BitSail"},{"prompt":"Bu Nika sedang menjelaskan pelajaran Bahasa Inggris di depan kelas Ketika ia melihat Runi dan Anggi sedang tertawa cekikikan.

However, improvements can be made to harness parallelism even in the accumulation stage. Rust's Rayon library provides powerful tools for parallel iteration and reduction. You can use the \`fold\` and \`reduce\` methods to parallelize the construction of gene coordinates. This approach would involve creating local \`HashMap\`s in parallel and then reducing them into a global \`HashMap\` across all the threads. Let's improve the efficiency of the code with a more parallel approach: \`\`\`rust use rayon::prelude::*; use std::collections::HashMap; use std::sync::Mutex; fn custom_par_parse(s: &str) -> Result<(Vec<BedRecord>, HashMap<String, (u32, u32)>), &'static str> { // Parse lines into BedRecords in parallel let records: Result<Vec<BedRecord>, &'static str> = s.par_lines() .map(|line| BedRecord::parse(line)) .collect(); let records = records?; // If an error occurs, propagate it. // Use Rayon's parallel iterator methods to construct the gene coordinates in parallel let gene_coordinates = Mutex::new(HashMap::new()); records.into_par_iter().for_each_with(gene_coordinates, |gene_coords_mutex, record| { let mut gene_coords = gene_coords_mutex.lock().unwrap(); let entry = gene_coords.entry(record.name.clone()) .or_insert((record.tx_start, record.tx_end)); entry.0 = entry.0.min(record.tx_start); entry.1 = entry.1.max(record.tx_end); }); // Release the lock and extract the HashMap let gene_coordinates = gene_coordinates.into_inner().unwrap(); // Return the vector of BedRecords and the HashMap of gene coordinates Ok((records, gene_coordinates)) } // Assuming you define BedRecord below... \`\`\` In this improved version, we still parse the \`BedRecord\`s in parallel, and then we use \`for_each_with\` with a \`Mutex\`-wrapped \`HashMap\` to safely accumulate the minimum start and maximum end coordinates for each gene in parallel. This approach can be quite efficient but has an overhead of locking and unlocking the \`Mutex\`. If you find that this is a bottleneck, you might want to use a lock-free data structure or reduce the level of parallelism to improve performance (e.g., by increasing the size of chunks processed by each thread).

Having the same understanding of death as a child, Whammer gently pokes the deer, thinking it’s asleep. When it isn’t moving, he panics and runs to get the others, hoping they can help. When they tell him the deer isn’t alive, he starts crying and they have to comfort him.","completion":"Once upon a time in the city of Fair City, Wordgirl and her super-powered allies had a day off from their usual battles with the city's rogues gallery of villains. On this particular sunny day, the villains decided to take a break from scheming too and ventured out of the city on a camping trip. The group included Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, Granny May, The Butcher, Lady Redundant Woman, and Whammer, known for his lovable personality despite being a bruiser. They gathered their tents, coolers filled with sandwiches (both evil and non-evil), and the villains set off for a day of sunshine and adventure. As they traipsed through the picturesque forest, they stumbled upon a meadow abuzz with colorful butterflies. Whammer's eyes widened with delight as he chased after a particularly vibrant butterfly, his enormous body surprisingly nimble as he went further into the forest. Deep in the woods, Whammer suddenly stopped in his tracks. He had lost sight of the butterfly and was now surrounded by silence. Just as he began to feel a twinge of nervousness, he spotted something lying quietly on the forest floor – a motionless deer. With the innocent heart of a child, Whammer approached the deer cautiously, thinking it was merely taking a nap. He gently poked the deer, expecting it to wake up and bound away just like the butterflies. But the deer remained lifeless. Panic washed over Whammer as his limited understanding of death slowly began to unravel before him. Without hesitation, he dashed back to where the villains were setting up camp, his voice trembling with worry. \\"Guys! Come quick! There's something wrong with the deer! It won't wake up!\\" Whammer cried out, his voice filled with genuine concern. His plea caught the attention of the other villains, who immediately dropped what they were doing and followed Whammer through the forest. Their faces turned from confusion to surprise as they reached the lifeless deer lying peacefully on the forest floor. Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy knelt down, observing the stillness that had overtaken the deer. Granny May put a comforting hand on Whammer's shoulder, recognizing the confusion and sadness in his eyes. The Butcher, with his blunt honesty, explained gently to Whammer that the deer was no longer alive. Tears welled up in Whammer's eyes as the realization sank in. \\"But... but I thought it was just sleeping,\\" he choked out, his deep voice quivering. The villains, known for their usually devious deeds and twisted plans, were touched by Whammer's compassion and innocence. They all gathered around him, offering silent comfort through their presence. Lady Redundant Woman even conjured up a few tissues to dry his tears. As Whammer's cries subsided, the villains shared stories of their own experiences with loss and found solace in the understanding of a kindred spirit. The afternoon sun shone down upon them, casting a warm glow on their circle of villains, reminding them of the preciousness of life and the need for compassion. With newfound empathy in their hearts, the villains decided to return to their campsite and honor the memory of the deer by planting beautiful flowers around its resting place. They spent the rest of the day enjoying each other's company, sharing laughter, and reflecting on the fragility and beauty of life. And from that day forward, Whammer, the lovable bruiser, developed an even deeper sense of compassion and understanding. He would never forget that simple act of gently poking the deer, thinking it was asleep, and the important lesson it taught him about the cycle of life. In its own unusual way, that camping trip had brought the villains closer together, reminding them of their shared humanity and the power of empathy – a truly remarkable transformation for Wordgirl's foes."},{"prompt":"Whammer wakes up in the middle of the night and can't stop himself from crying, still heartbroken over the deer.

But within the darkness, Whammer's heart remained heavy with sorrow. Unable to shake off the memory of the deceased deer, he found himself waking up in the middle of the night, tears streaming down his face, his silent sobs echoing through the stillness. As Whammer wept, the normally gruff and tough Butcher stirred from his slumber. Curiosity piqued, he silently emerged from his tent. Glimpsing Whammer's tear-streaked face in the dim light, Butcher's concern overcame his initial surprise. \\"Whammer, are you alright?\\" Butcher asked softly, his voice filled with genuine worry. Sniffling, Whammer looked up, his eyes red and swollen. \\"I can't stop crying. I miss the deer, Butcher. It's not fair that it's gone forever.\\" Butcher knelt down next to Whammer, a tenderness not often seen in his eyes. He understood the weight of grief and the difficulty of comprehending the finality of death. Taking a deep breath, he placed a hand on Whammer's massive shoulder, offering a simple act of comfort. \\"I know it hurts, Whammer,\\" Butcher said, his voice gentle. \\"Losing something we care about is never easy, especially when it's something as innocent as that deer. It's okay to be sad.\\" Whammer sniffled again, wiping his eyes with a trembling hand. \\"Butcher… why does everything have to end like that? Why can't things just keep going? It's not fair.\\" Butcher's eyes softened further, understanding the depth of Whammer's confusion and pain. He thought back to his own experiences of loss and tried to find the right words to convey his feelings. \\"Life is a delicate balance, my friend,\\" Butcher explained with a sigh. \\"Everything has a beginning and an end. Just like we all have a time to be alive, things in nature have their own purpose and lifespan. It's part of a bigger cycle that we can't always control.\\" Whammer's brow furrowed, desperate for answers. \\"But what's the point if everything just ends anyway? How can we be happy if we know it'll all go away someday?\\" Butcher's weathered face broke into a small smile, a glimmer of wisdom shining in his eyes. \\"Whammer, the point is to cherish and appreciate the time we have. To make moments count, to find joy in the fleeting beauty of life. Just because something ends doesn't mean it loses its value or significance.\\" As Butcher spoke, a newfound understanding began to dawn on Whammer's tear-stained face. Slowly, his cries softened into soft sniffles, infused with a touch of bittersweet acceptance. He looked up at Butcher, gratitude shining through his watery eyes. \\"Thank you, Butcher,\\" Whammer said, his voice cracking with emotion. \\"I know the deer isn't coming back, but I'll remember it and love it forever.\\" Butcher smiled, warmth radiating from within. He squeezed Whammer's shoulder gently, offering comfort through the darkness. \\"We'll remember it together, Whammer. And it'll forever remind us to treasure and appreciate the beauty in every fleeting moment we have in this world.\\""},{"prompt":"The next day, Whammer wakes up before the others hearing loud bleating.

Intrigued, Whammer eased himself out of his sleeping bag and followed the melodious sound into the dense forest. His heart raced with anticipation, wondering what could be causing such a commotion. As he approached a small clearing, his steps slowed to a quiet tiptoe, not wanting to disturb the mystery unfolding before him. There, bathed in the gentle light filtering through the lush canopy, stood a majestic deer. Its coat shimmered like copper in the sunlight, and a soft smile curved upon Whammer's lips. He watched, as if in a trance, as the deer delicately licked the wet fur of a tiny, newborn fawn nestled among the flora. Whammer, in awe of this intimate moment between mother and child, felt a spark of pure joy ignite within him. It was as if the universe were giving him a gift, a glimmer of hope and renewal amidst the weight of his recent grief. Overwhelmed by an indescribable happiness, Whammer couldn't help but let out a delighted gasp. The sound caught the attention of the mother deer, who turned her head and locked eyes with Whammer. For a moment, there was a silent exchange of understanding, as if both creatures shared a connection beyond words. Emotion bubbling in his chest, Whammer raised an enormous hand to his heart and softly whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" As if acknowledging his gratitude, the deer gracefully nudged her fawn, encouraging it to rise to its wobbly legs. The fawn obeyed, trying its best to stand tall as Whammer watched in amazement. A sense of wonder washed over him as he realized that life had a way of carrying on, even in the face of loss. With newfound serenity, Whammer backed away, leaving the mother and fawn to bask in the serenity of their bond. He retraced his steps back to the campsite, a joyful spring in his stride. And with each step, his heart resonated with a renewed appreciation for the beauty and resilience of life. When Whammer arrived back at the campsite, the other villains were just beginning to stir. Their eyes widened as they beheld the radiant grin adorning Whammer's face. Granny May arched an eyebrow inquisitively, while Lady Redundant Woman let out a surprised gasp. \\"Butcher, Chuck, Granny May! You won't believe what I just saw!\\" Whammer exclaimed, his voice brimming with excitement. \\"A mother deer with her newborn fawn! It was the most incredible thing!\\" The villains exchanged curious glances, their interest piqued by Whammer's contagious enthusiasm. They gathered around him, eager to hear his tale. Whammer proceeded to paint a vivid picture with his words, skillfully conveying the beauty and hope he had witnessed in that secret clearing. As Whammer finished his story, a quiet moment of awe descended upon the villains. Their usually mischievous hearts were touched by the wonder and magic of nature's ceaseless circle. Silently, they acknowledged the delicate dance between life and loss, and the enduring strength to be found in the tiniest of miracles. In that moment, a newfound camaraderie bloomed among the villains, bound together by a shared appreciation for life's mysteries. And as they gazed out at the sprawling wilderness surrounding them, they no longer saw the forest as an adversary to conquer but as a source of solace, inspiration, and unexpected beauty.

Suddenly, a rustling noise broke through the silence, diverting their attention. Emerging from behind a thicket, a small baby bear bounded towards them, a playful twinkle in its eyes. The baby bear seemed unbothered by the presence of the villains and innocently approached Whammer. The baby bear gleefully nudged Whammer's leg with its tiny muzzle, its touch surprisingly gentle. Whammer's initial shock dissolved into a mixture of surprise and delight. He carefully knelt down, his immense size now matched with a tenderness that he seldom displayed. \\"Hey there, little one,\\" Whammer whispered, his voice brimming with affection. He gently reached out and stroked the baby bear's fur, his hand dwarfing the cub's head. The baby bear responded with an enthusiastic wag of its tail, seemingly unaware of the potential danger the villains represented. Instead, it saw in them potential friends or playmates in this vast forest. Chuck, Granny May, and Lady Redundant Woman watched the heartwarming scene unfold, their fear gradually melting away. The presence of the baby bear reminded them of the innocence and purity that could be found even amidst the most unexpected circumstances. Butcher couldn't resist joining in the unexpected bonding moment. He crouched down, his gruff exterior giving way to a rare kindness.

For example, there are restrictions on LGBT+ rights, as certain actions or expressions may be seen as contrary to traditional values or considered harmful to children.","completion":"While it is true that cultural and traditional values have a significant influence on the protection of civil rights in Russia, it is important to note that certain restrictions on LGBT+ rights can hinder progress towards equality and inclusivity. Russian society has a deep-rooted history of conservative values, largely influenced by the Russian Orthodox Church and a traditionalist perspective. The perception of homosexuality as contrary to traditional cultural values can lead to the implementation of laws that limit the rights and freedoms of the LGBT+ community. One such example is the infamous \\"gay propaganda law\\" passed in 2013, which prohibits the dissemination of information supporting non-traditional sexual relationships to minors. While this law claims to protect children from harmful content, it effectively restricts freedom of expression and perpetuates discrimination against LGBT+ individuals. These restrictions on LGBT+ rights not only violate the rights to freedom of expression and assembly but also contribute to a climate of homophobia and discrimination. This can lead to social marginalization, harassment, and violence against the LGBT+ community, hampering their ability to enjoy full civil rights and protections. It is crucial to recognize that protecting civil rights does not require undermining cultural or traditional values. Instead, it calls for finding a balance that respects the right to individual expression and the principle of non-discrimination. Efforts should be made to promote understanding, acceptance, and tolerance among all members of society, including educating the public about diversity, gender identities, and sexual orientations. In recent years, activism within Russia's LGBT+ community and advocacy organizations has grown despite the challenging environment. These groups strive to raise awareness, combat stereotypes, and advocate for legal reforms to protect the rights of LGBT+ individuals. However, it is essential to emphasize the importance of ongoing dialogue and engagement with the government and broader society to address these issues effectively. This means encouraging public conversations, promoting acceptance, and challenging discriminatory actions and laws that impede the protection of civil rights for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. In conclusion, cultural and traditional values undoubtedly play a role in shaping the protection of civil rights in Russia, including restrictions on LGBT+ rights. It is crucial, however, to find a delicate balance between respecting cultural values and ensuring equal treatment and protection for all individuals. Moving forward, it is imperative to foster greater acceptance, understanding, and inclusivity within Russian society to build a more just and equitable future for all its citizens."},{"prompt":"continue The Russian government has the right to impose restrictions on civil rights, in particular freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. The government can use laws and regulations to control independent media, civil society organizations and NGOs by imposing restrictions on their activities and limiting their influence.","completion":"While it is true that governments have the authority to impose restrictions on civil rights, it is important to uphold the principle of proportionality and ensure that these limitations do not unduly infringe upon fundamental freedoms or impede the development of a democratic society. In the case of Russia, there have been instances where restrictions on civil rights, particularly freedom of expression and assembly, have been used to limit the activities and influence of independent media, civil society organizations, and NGOs. The Russian government has implemented laws and regulations that can be used to control and suppress dissent by imposing restrictions on these entities. For example, laws such as the Foreign Agents Law and the Law on Undesirable Organizations have been used to label critical organizations as \\"foreign agents\\" or \\"undesirable,\\" which can lead to significant burdensome reporting requirements, financial penalties, and criminal charges for non-compliance. Furthermore, laws such as the Law on Extremism and the Law on Mass Media have been used to silence independent voices and exercise control over the media landscape. These laws can be broadly interpreted and employed to curb criticism, censor information, and target individuals or groups that express dissenting views. By imposing these restrictions, the government aims to maintain control, suppress opposition, and shape public discourse. However, such actions can undermine the principles of democratic governance, restrict freedom of thought and expression, and hinder the development of an informed and pluralistic society. It is important to note that the protection of civil rights, including freedom of expression and assembly, is essential for a functioning democracy. These rights provide the necessary space for individuals and groups to express their views, engage in public debate, and challenge government actions, fostering accountability and ensuring the protection of citizens' interests. Efforts should be made to promote transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights within the legal framework of any country, including Russia. This can be achieved through encouraging dialogue, independent media, and an independent judiciary that can safeguard rights and provide checks and balances on governmental actions. In conclusion, while governments have the right to impose restrictions on civil rights, it is crucial to ensure that these limitations are necessary, proportional, and consistent with international human rights standards. Upholding civil rights, including freedom of expression and assembly, is vital for a democratic society that respects the dignity and freedom of its citizens."},{"prompt":"continue There are concerns about the independence of the judiciary in Russia. It is believed that the judiciary is subject to political influence that can affect the impartiality and fairness of judicial proceedings. This could affect the effectiveness of civil rights protection.","completion":"You're correct in highlighting concerns about the independence of the judiciary in Russia. The perception of political influence on the judiciary has raised questions about the impartiality and fairness of judicial proceedings, which can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of civil rights protection. In Russia, the judiciary has been criticized for being subject to political pressure and lacking the necessary autonomy to act as an independent and impartial arbiter. Judicial appointments, promotions, and dismissals often come under scrutiny, with allegations of political bias playing a role in decision-making processes. The lack of judicial independence can result in cases being decided based on political considerations rather than principles of fairness and justice. This raises concerns about the protection of civil rights, as individuals are entitled to fair and impartial proceedings that uphold the rule of law. Furthermore, the influence of political authorities on law enforcement agencies can also impact civil rights protection. The selective application of laws and the targeting of individuals or groups for political reasons can undermine the principle of equality before the law and impede the effective protection of civil rights. To ensure the protection of civil rights, it is essential to have an independent judiciary that operates free from political interference and in compliance with international standards. This includes guaranteeing the tenure, selection, and promotion of judges based on merit and qualifications rather than political allegiance. Efforts should also be made to strengthen legal education, training, and professional development for judges to enhance their knowledge and understanding of human rights principles and international legal standards. This can contribute to the proper application of laws, ensuring that civil rights are protected and upheld. Additionally, mechanisms for accountability, such as an independent oversight body or a well-functioning appellate system, can help address allegations of political influence and ensure that judicial decisions are based on legal principles rather than external pressures. Promoting a culture of respect for the rule of law, transparency, and accountability within the judiciary and legal system is crucial to enhancing the protection of civil rights. This includes fostering an environment where judges are free to make fair and impartial decisions and where individuals can trust in the judiciary's ability to safeguard their rights. In conclusion, concerns about the independence of the judiciary in Russia are valid, as political influence can affect the impartiality and fairness of judicial proceedings. Establishing and reinforcing an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law and operates without external pressures is vital for effective civil rights protection."},{"prompt":"limits to the protection of civil rights","completion":"While the protection of civil rights is crucial for a just and equitable society, it is important to acknowledge that there can be limits to these rights in certain circumstances. These limits are often put in place to balance the rights of individuals with the broader interests of society, and they vary from country to country based on legal frameworks and cultural norms. Here are a few common examples of limits to the protection of civil rights: 1. Public safety and national security: Governments may impose restrictions on civil liberties, such as freedom of assembly or privacy, in the interest of public safety or national security. For instance, during times of emergency, like natural disasters or potential terrorist threats, certain civil rights might be temporarily curtailed to protect the general welfare. 2. Hate speech and incitement: Many countries place limitations on freedom of speech when it comes to hate speech or speech that incites violence or discrimination. These restrictions aim to prevent harm or protect vulnerable individuals or minority groups from being targeted and subjected to discrimination or violence. 3. Balancing competing rights: In some cases, civil rights can come into conflict with one another. Courts may need to strike a balance between conflicting rights, such as freedom of religion versus freedom from discrimination. In such instances, limitations may be imposed to ensure that no single right excessively infringes upon another. 4. Public decency and morals: Societies often regulate actions or expressions that are deemed contrary to public decency or morals. These restrictions can impact civil rights related to freedom of expression or lifestyle choices. For example, certain forms of artistic expression or behavior that is considered indecent or offensive may be subject to limitations. 5. Privacy and data protection: While the right to privacy is a fundamental civil right, advancements in technology have raised new challenges regarding the collection and use of personal data. Governments may impose regulations to protect individual privacy and ensure the responsible handling of personal information. These regulations may limit the free flow of information to safeguard individuals' rights. It is important for societies to carefully consider and justify any limitations placed on civil rights. These limits should be lawful, necessary, proportionate, and subject to regular review to ensure they do not unduly encroach upon individual freedoms. Striking the right balance between protecting civil rights and addressing legitimate societal concerns is an ongoing challenge that requires careful deliberation and engagement with various stakeholders."},{"prompt":"classification of methods of civil rights protection","completion":"Methods of civil rights protection can be broadly classified into three categories: legal, institutional, and societal. 1. Legal methods: Legal methods involve using legal frameworks, legislation, and court systems to secure and defend civil rights. These include: a) Constitutional Protections: Constitutional provisions form the bedrock of civil rights protection by enshrining fundamental rights and freedoms. These rights provide a legal basis to challenge discriminatory practices and seek redress through the courts. b) Legislation: Laws and statutes specifically aimed at protecting civil rights, such as anti-discrimination laws, provide legal recourse for individuals who face discrimination based on race, gender, religion, disability, or other protected characteristics. c) Judicial Remedies: Courts play a vital role in upholding civil rights by interpreting and applying the law to individual cases. They have the power to issue judgments and compel authorities to respect and protect civil rights. 2. Institutional methods: Institutional methods involve creating bodies and mechanisms that oversee civil rights protection. These include: a) Human Rights Commissions/Commissions for Equality: These independent institutions investigate complaints of discrimination and promote equal rights. They can mediate disputes, provide advisory support, and promote awareness and education on civil rights issues. b) Ombudsman/Office of Special Rapporteur: These offices act as independent oversight bodies, monitoring and investigating violations of civil rights and promoting accountability. c) Law Enforcement and Prosecution: Law enforcement agencies and criminal justice systems play a role in protecting civil rights by investigating and prosecuting crimes related to human rights violations, hate crimes, or discrimination. 3. Societal methods: Societal methods involve mobilizing public support and raising awareness through advocacy efforts. These include: a) Civil Society Organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): NGOs play a vital role in advocating for civil rights, monitoring human rights violations, and providing support and resources to marginalized communities. They work towards influencing public opinion and policy change. b) Grassroots Activism: Grassroots movements and activist groups bring attention to civil rights issues and mobilize communities to demand change. They often organize protests, campaigns, and other forms of collective action to raise awareness and exert pressure on authorities. c) Education and Awareness: Promoting education on civil rights issues fosters a culture of respect and inclusion. Educational initiatives can challenge discrimination, stereotypes, and biases, empowering individuals to exercise and protect their civil rights. It is important to note that these methods often work in synergy, reinforcing each other to ensure comprehensive civil rights protection. A combination of legal, institutional, and societal approaches helps create an environment that respects, upholds, and promotes the civil rights of all individuals."},{"prompt":"Types of ways to protect civil rights","completion":"There are several types of ways to protect civil rights: 1. Legal and Legislative Protection: This involves enacting laws and regulations that protect civil rights and ensure equal treatment and opportunities for all individuals. This includes anti-discrimination laws, constitutional provisions, and human rights legislation that prohibit discrimination based on characteristics such as race, gender, religion, disability, or sexual orientation. 2. Judicial Remedies: Access to the courts and the legal system is essential for the protection of civil rights. Individuals can seek legal recourse and remedies through the judicial system when their rights are violated. Courts can issue judgments, provide injunctive relief, and award compensation to victims of civil rights violations. 3. Advocacy and Activism: Civil rights can be protected through advocacy efforts and activism. This includes raising awareness, lobbying for policy changes, and organizing public campaigns to address systemic issues and create social change. Advocacy groups and activists play a crucial role in mobilizing public support and pushing for reform. 4. Education and Awareness: Promoting education and awareness about civil rights issues is essential for protecting and upholding these rights. Education can help individuals understand their rights, recognize discrimination and injustice, and promote an inclusive and respectful society. It also involves educating policymakers, professionals, and the general public about the importance of civil rights and the impact of discrimination. 5. Independent Monitoring and Oversight: Establishing independent monitoring bodies, ombudsman offices, or human rights commissions can help ensure compliance with civil rights standards. These bodies can investigate complaints, monitor government actions, and provide recommendations to promote and protect civil rights. 6. International Mechanisms: International mechanisms, such as human rights treaties, can provide a framework for civil rights protection. Ratifying and adhering to international conventions and participating in international human rights bodies can help ensure accountability and promote consistent standards of civil rights protection. 7. Community Engagement and Dialogue: Open and inclusive dialogues within communities can facilitate the protection of civil rights by fostering understanding, empathy, and respect. Encouraging dialogue can help address prejudices, challenge stereotypes, and build bridges between different groups, contributing to a more inclusive society. It is important to combine these different approaches to comprehensively protect civil rights. Collaboration between government, civil society organizations, activists, the legal system, and the public is crucial in safeguarding and advancing civil rights for all individuals."},{"prompt":"write an introduction for the paragraph Types of defenses in civil law","completion":"In civil law, various types of defenses can be employed to protect individuals or entities involved in a legal dispute. These defenses serve as legal strategies or arguments that aim to refute or mitigate the allegations or claims made against the defendant. From raising procedural issues to challenging the validity of the plaintiff's claims, the use of these defenses plays a critical role in shaping the outcome of civil cases. Understanding the range of defenses available within civil law is essential for individuals, legal professionals, and parties involved in civil disputes to effectively protect their rights and interests."},{"prompt":"continue This involves enacting laws and regulations that protect civil rights and ensure equal treatment and opportunity for all people. This includes anti-discrimination laws, constitutional provisions and human rights legislation that prohibit discrimination on grounds such as race, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation.","completion":"These laws and regulations are crucial in safeguarding civil rights and promoting equality within society. Anti-discrimination laws prohibit unequal treatment or unjust practices based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, religion, disability, or sexual orientation. They establish a legal framework that fosters equal opportunities in areas such as employment, housing, education, and public services. Constitutional protections form the foundation of civil rights by enshrining fundamental rights and freedoms. Constitutions often include provisions that explicitly protect individual liberties, ensuring that all citizens are entitled to equal treatment and protection under the law. Human rights legislation, both domestic and international, further bolsters civil rights protection. These laws outline the rights and freedoms that all individuals are entitled to, regardless of their background or status. They create legal obligations for governments to respect, protect, and fulfill civil rights, setting standards that guide legal systems and policies. By enacting these laws and regulations, societies aim to prevent discrimination, promote inclusivity, and create an environment where all individuals can fully participate and contribute. They provide individuals with legal recourse when their civil rights are violated and act as a deterrent to discriminatory practices. It is important to regularly review and update these laws to address emerging challenges and ensure they remain effective in protecting civil rights. Additionally, education and awareness campaigns are crucial to informing individuals about their rights and empowering them to take action against discrimination. While the enactment of laws and regulations is a significant step, achieving true equality and protection of civil rights requires continuous efforts from policymakers, legal professionals, civil society organizations, and the general public. Through collective action and an unwavering commitment to upholding civil rights, societies can work towards a more just and inclusive future for all."},{"prompt":"Continue Access to the courts and the legal system is essential for the protection of civil rights. When a person's rights are violated, he or she can seek legal redress in court. Courts can issue judgments, grant injunctions and award compensation to victims of civil rights violations.","completion":"Access to the courts and the legal system serves as a crucial safeguard for protecting civil rights. When an individual's rights are violated, seeking legal redress through the court system becomes a vital avenue for pursuing justice and securing remedies. Courts play a pivotal role in upholding civil rights by interpreting and applying the law to individual cases. They provide a forum where individuals can present their grievances, challenge infringements, and seek appropriate resolutions. Through the legal process, courts have the power to issue judgments that define and defend civil rights. These judgments establish legal precedent, shaping future interpretations and applications of civil rights laws. They set important standards for the protection of individual liberties and guide future legal action. In addition to judgments, courts have the authority to grant injunctions. These court orders can temporarily or permanently enjoin certain actions or behaviors that infringe upon civil rights. Injunctions can provide immediate relief to individuals facing ongoing harm, and they can be instrumental in restoring and protecting civil rights. Compensation is another important aspect of civil rights protection that can be awarded by courts. When civil rights violations result in damages, courts can order the responsible party to compensate the victim for losses suffered. This compensation can help restore dignity, provide a sense of justice, and deter future violations. Access to the courts ensures that civil rights are not mere abstract concepts, but tangible and enforceable protections. It empowers individuals to seek redress and holds accountable those who infringe upon their civil liberties. It forms a crucial pillar of democracy, fostering the rule of law and ensuring equal treatment under the legal system. However, it is important to recognize that barriers to accessing the courts can exist, such as financial constraints, lack of legal representation, or procedural complexities. Addressing these barriers and promoting equal access to justice for all is essential to truly protect civil rights. Overall, the availability of legal redress through the courts is a fundamental tool for individuals to enforce their civil rights, challenge injustices, and hold violators accountable."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The story takes place in the future in 2242. The tournament was in full swing. It's time for Reyna and her sister Lily to enter the training ground for the exhibition fight. Ten-year-old Lily stood opposite Reyna in a fighting stance. Reina released the power of black flames and clots of powerful energy swirled around her. Lily understood that she was weak and that she was much weaker than her fifteen-year-old sister. Reyna was the crown princess of the galactic empire. Her father stripped her of her title and inheritance and threw her out onto the street. He made Lily heir. Reyna vowed to take back everything that was taken from her. Lily helped her father and Reina decided to take revenge on her sister at this tournament for her betrayal. But Reina did not know that her father and sister acted so cruelly out of love for Reina and to save her from death. During the fight, Reyna suddenly fell to her knees and grabbed her head and screamed as pain shot through her head. The fight was stopped by the judges. Lily looked at Reyna. Reina cried in pain. Lily wanted to approach, but Reyna did not let her in, surrounding herself with a protective shield. Lily tried to break through the shield but she failed. Reyna was suddenly enveloped in a bright light. Lily tried again and again to get through to Reyna. Lily shouted to her that she loved her very much. Reyna suddenly began to dissolve little by little into the air and disappear. Lily fell to her knees in front of Reyna's protective dome and cried loudly as Reyna completely disappeared. Lily said through her tears that she would find Reina again and that there was someone who loved her and was waiting for her. Lily understood that Reyna had not disappeared or died. And Lily also knew that the guy who was with her all this time was in love with Reyna. But Reyna didn't know about this. Please write the dialogues. Write the entire prompt from beginning to end.","completion":"The arena was alive with the hum of anticipation, spectators perched on the edge of their seats, their eyes fixated on the shimmering training grounds where magic and might were about to clash. Under the guise of an exhibition fight, a deeper, more personal battle was set to unfold, with the threads of destiny tightly interwoven around the two combatants. Reyna, once a crown princess now a defiant pariah, took to the field, her raven hair billowing like the dark storm that she was inside. With a commanding intensity in her eyes, she faced Lily, the sister who had become an inadvertent symbol of her greatest loss. Lily, small and delicate at ten years of age, stood opposite Reyna, her body tense, her mind a swirl of fear and resolve. This was not just a spar between siblings; this was the moment Reyna had been waiting for, the moment to exact revenge on the one who now bore the title meant for her. \\"Ready yourself, Lily,\\" Reyna's voice boomed, resonant with the power that coursed through her veins, the black flames of her essence licking the air. Lily nodded, resolute, despite the knot in her stomach. \\"I'll do what I must, Reyna,\\" she replied, though the quiver in her voice betrayed the bravery she projected. With a fierce cry, Reyna unleashed her pent-up fury, energy crackling and snaking around her in a fearsome dance. Lily watched, knowing full well her own limitations, but determined not to cower. Then, faster than the eye could follow, Reyna was upon her, a blur of shadow and inferno. Lily dodged and weaved, her own powers meek lights against the relentless dark. The struggle seemed unequal, unfair, but beneath the surface lay secrets untold. As they fought, it was clear that Reyna's anger was fueled by more than just a usurped throne—it was personal, heart-wrenching. \\"You betrayed me!\\" Reyna howled, her strikes becoming wild with emotion. \\"I had no choice! Father—\\" Lily started, but she was cut off by another barrage of black-flamed assault. Suddenly, in the midst of combat, Reyna staggered, her hands flying to her head as she screamed in agony. The haunting cry echoed through the arena, silencing the crowd, halting the fight. \\"Stop the fight!\\" the judges commanded, concern etching their faces as they witnessed the unexpected turn of events. In the hush that followed, Reyna's pained sobs cut through the air like a blade. She erected a shimmering shield around herself, a barrier to keep all at bay, including her sister. Lily, eyes wide with worry, rushed forward. \\"Reyna, please! I can't help if you shut me out!\\" Her hands met the shield, the barrier refusing her entry, reflecting the desperation in her tear-filled eyes. Again and again, she pushed against the invisible wall, but to no avail. As she pleaded, a brilliant light enveloped Reyna, the energy swirling around her like a cocoon, hinting at transformation— or transcendence. \\"Reyna! I love you! Please, you have to know that!\\" Lily's voice was raw with emotion, her fists pounding against the futile barrier. Fragments of Reyna's form began to dissipate, vanishing into the charged air, leaving Lily to collapse to the ground, sobs wracking her small frame. \\"You are not alone, Reyna. There's someone who's been by your side, who loves you deeply... and you don't even know it,\\" Lily murmured between choked tears, speaking of the one whose silent affection for Reyna had gone unspoken. With her final words hanging in the tense atmosphere, Reyna's presence dwindled until nothing remained but the echo of her pain and her sister's lament. Lily, left kneeling where once her sister stood, made a vow through the veil of sorrow, \\"I will find you again, Reyna. Whatever it takes, I promise.\\" Unknown to Reyna, in her darkest moment, a story of love awaited, its chapters unwritten, and the boy who held her heart all this while, left adrift with his unconfessed dream."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The magnitude of the dynamic effects largely depends on the characteristics of the train– track–bridge system and their interfaces. From the track–bridge system, the stiffness, mass, and damping properties are particularly relevant, both from the bridge and track, while from the train subsystem, the speed, the loading scheme (i.e., number of axles, axles spacing, and loads values), as well as the values of the sprung and unsprung masses, are important parameters [4,5]. Regarding the wheel–rail interface, the characterization of the track irregularities profiles and wheel defects (e.g., wheel flats and polygonization) are also relevant.","completion":"Railway viaducts represent engineering marvels that must withstand the dynamic forces imparted by passing trains, with these forces becoming especially pronounced at velocities exceeding 200 kilometers per hour. The dynamic loads transmitted to these structures are contingent upon the synergistic behavior of the train–track–viaduct interaction. Within this interactive network, the physical attributes of the bridge and track, including their rigidity, mass distribution, and energy dissipation capabilities, play a crucial role. Simultaneously, the operational characteristics of the train, such as its velocity, axle load distribution, axle spacing, and the magnitudes of both suspended and non-suspended weights, are influential factors that demand careful consideration [6,7]. Additionally, the contact points between wheels and rails demand meticulous attention. The precise delineation of rail irregularities and the identification of any anomalies in wheel geometry, such as flat spots or the development of polygonal shapes, contribute to the overall dynamics experienced by the structure. It is within the nuances of these interactions that the intricacies of railway bridge response to high-speed train transit are deeply rooted."},{"prompt":"write about Railway bridges, dynamic effects induced by traffic loads, train– track–bridge system","completion":"Railway bridges serve as critical junctures within the vast network of the railway infrastructure, acting as mediators between the terrestrial challenges posed by varied landscapes and the necessity for smooth, seamless transit. These structures must faithfully convey the colossal loads of freight and passenger trains across obstacles, all the while enduring the dynamic effects that such traffic imposes. Dynamic effects on railway bridges can be complex and multifaceted, stemming from the transient forces that trains exert as they move across the bridge structure. Unlike static loads, which remain relatively constant, dynamic loads fluctuate and can cause vibrations, deflections, and oscillations within the bridge. These dynamic interactions increase with traffic, speed, and can have significant repercussions on the longevity and safety of the structure. The analysis of dynamic effects requires a holistic understanding of the entire train–track–bridge system. This system consists of a symbiotic relationship between the moving train, the track or rail upon which it moves, and the bridge that supports it all. The interplay among these components can significantly affect the vibrational characteristics of the bridge: 1. **Bridge Dynamics**: The design parameters of the bridge—such as its span length, structural composition, and the materials used—determine its natural frequencies and how it will resonate with the forces exerted by the train. 2. **Track Properties**: Elements such as the type of rail, the quality and maintenance of the trackbed, and the presence of sleepers and ballast contribute to the damping of dynamic loads. A well-maintained track can absorb and dissipate some energy, reducing the impact on the bridge structure. 3. **Train Dynamics**: The train itself, with variables like speed, axle load, axle configuration, suspension systems, and the mass of the train cars, directly influences the magnitude and distribution of dynamic effects on the bridge. High-speed trains, in particular, can excite bridge frequencies and cause large amplitude vibrations. 4. **Wheel-rail Interaction**: The contact interface where the train's wheels meet the rails is another crucial point of consideration. Rail irregularities and defects in wheel geometry can cause additional dynamic impacts, leading to forceful, repetitive strikes on the rail, which then transmit to the bridge. 5. **Aerodynamic Effects**: At high speeds, trains can generate substantial aerodynamic forces that may influence bridge dynamics. This aspect, while not related directly to train–track–bridge mechanical interaction, is a factor for certain bridge designs. 6. **Environmental Factors**: Temperature changes, wind loads, and seismic events can also interplay with the induced dynamic effects from the train loads, further complicating the overall response of railway bridges. Given the multitude of factors that affect the dynamic response of railway bridges to traffic loads, engineers employ sophisticated models and simulations to predict and mitigate adverse effects. Ensuring the durability, performance, and safety of these structures demands a comprehensive approach that encompasses advanced materials, cutting-edge design methodologies, regular maintenance strategies, and continual monitoring systems to account for the complex dynamism of the train–track–bridge system."},{"prompt":"write in paraphrases, sound like a human not a machine","completion":"When we talk about railroad trestles, those iron and concrete giants straddling rivers and canyons, we're also talking about the dance they perform with speeding trains on a daily basis. These bridges aren't just passive lumps of material; they're lively participants in the journey of every locomotive that thunders across them. Picture this: A train barrels down the track, but it's not just pressing down on the bridge like a heavy weight on a bench. It's actually more like a series of rapid punches with varying force, thanks to its dynamic load. It's a bit like having a dozing giant on your couch that suddenly starts tossing and turning. And the faster that giant moves, the more intense those movements become—especially when you push past that 200 km/h mark. Now, imagine the bridge and tracks as a team, each bringing something to the performance. The bridge's design—its length, the material it's made from, the way it's put together—decides how it sways and shakes when the train goes by. If it's stiff and sturdy, it won't wiggle much, but if it's long and slender, it could start to swing like a jump rope. Don't forget the tracks themselves either. When they're in top-notch shape, bolted down and cozy in their bed of stones, they act like shock absorbers, taking some of the hit so that the bridge doesn't have to handle it all alone. And the train—well, it's the star of the show. Its speed, how much each car weighs, how they're spread out along its length, all these numbers feed into the frenzy. Trains of the modern age, the sleek high-speed ones, can really get the ground shaking and the bridge bouncing. One more thing—where the rubber meets the road, or, in this case, where the steel wheel meets the steel rail, is super important. If either of those is even a bit off, with a nick or a bump, you're going to get a beat that no one wants to dance to, sending jarring shocks through the whole setup. And just to spice things up, the weather might join in too. A gust of wind, a drop in temperature, or a surprise quake could give the bridge one more thing to contend with while it's already trying to manage the passing train. In the end, keeping these steel-stringed bridges fit for their rhythmic gymnastics with trains is no simple feat. Engineers spend heaps of time tinkering with models, kinda like playing with super advanced Lego sets, to make sure the bridges not only stand up but also groove in tune with the rails and the trains. Regular check-ups, solid design, and some smart tech help keep the music flowing smoothly across rivers and gorges day after day."},{"prompt":"Write me a story about the Wordgirl villains on a camping trip when Whammer, the villains’ lovable bruiser, wanders off from the group chasing a butterfly and comes across a deceased dear.

When they tell him the deer isn’t alive, he starts crying and they have to comfort him.","completion":"Once upon a time, in the city of Fair City, the villains of Wordgirl decided to take a break from their mischievous plans and embark on a camping trip. Dr. Two-Brains, Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, Lady Redundant Woman, and even the Butcher were all in high spirits as they ventured into the great outdoors. Whammer, the villains' lovable bruiser, was especially excited about the trip. With his enormous muscles and soft heart, Whammer had his own unique way of looking at the world. He saw everything through the innocent eyes of a child. As they settled into their campsite, Whammer noticed a beautiful butterfly flitting about in the distance. Curiosity stirred within him as he stepped away from the group, his large frame crashing through the underbrush. Entranced by the colorful insect, he followed it deeper into the forest. After a while, Whammer looked around and realized he had wandered far from the others. But the butterfly was still in sight, so he continued to chase after it. As he ran, he heard a rustling sound nearby. Intrigued, he walked towards the noise. To his surprise, Whammer stumbled upon a deer lying motionless on the forest floor. The deer's eyes were closed, her body still and peaceful. In Whammer's mind, he saw the deer lying there, much like a child would imagine their beloved pet sleeping soundly. Curiosity piqued, Whammer approached the deer with gentle steps. Kneeling down, he cautiously poked the deer's side, hoping she would awaken. But the deer remained still, unresponsive to his touch. Confusion and concern grew within the lovable bruiser. In a panic, Whammer quickly sprang to his feet and sprinted back to the campsite. Tears streamed down his face as he burst through the trees, shouting for his companions. \\"Guys! Guys! Come quick! The deer won't wake up! Something's wrong!\\" Dr. Two-Brains, Chuck, Lady Redundant Woman, and even the Butcher gathered around, their curious expressions transforming into ones of solemnity as they followed Whammer back to the deer. Kneeling beside the lifeless creature, Dr. Two-Brains gently explained to Whammer, \\"Oh, dear Whammer, I'm afraid this deer isn't asleep. It's called death. Sometimes, living things can no longer be with us, and they pass away.\\" Confusion and heartache filled Whammer's eyes as he glanced up at his villainous comrades. His bottom lip quivered, and tears continued to stream down his cheeks. \\"But... but she's not coming back? She won't wake up?\\" The villains sighed, their hearts sinking for their innocent friend. They knelt down, encircling Whammer with comforting hands. Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy gave Whammer a hesitant pat on the back, while Lady Redundant Woman gently wiped away his tears. \\"No, Whammer, she won't wake up,\\" Lady Redundant Woman softly replied. \\"But remember, she had a life, spent her days wandering through this forest, and even though she's no longer here, her spirit will always be a part of nature.\\" Whammer sniffled and then wrapped his massive arms around his friends, seeking solace in their warmth. He realized that even though he couldn't bring the deer back to life, he could cherish her memory and understand the fragility of life. As night fell and the stars shone above the villains' campsite, they stayed by Whammer's side, comforting him until his tears subsided. They sat together in a circle, sharing stories about their beautiful world and the interconnectedness of all living beings. From that day forward, Whammer carried a newfound understanding of life and death. And the villains of Wordgirl, though they often found themselves in mischief, knew that sometimes, their greatest adventures were the ones they shared as friends, supporting one another through joy and heartache alike."},{"prompt":"Whammer, still heartbroken over the dead deer, wakes up in the middle of the night and starts crying when he realizes the same happened to HIS mama tears ago when he was little and no one told him where she went. The other villains wake up to him crying and try to make him feel better.","completion":"In the quiet tranquility of the forest, Whammer stirred and woke up in the middle of the night. As his drowsiness wore off, his heart suddenly felt heavy again, remembering the sight of the lifeless deer. And then, memories from his own past emerged from the depths of his mind. Whammer sat up, tears welling up in his eyes as he recalled his own mama, who had vanished from his life when he was just a little Whammer. No one had ever explained to him where she had gone. The pain of that loss had lingered inside him, buried beneath his tough exterior, all these years.

They packed their things and made their way to a secluded spot deep within the forest, where they hoped to enjoy a peaceful few days without the interference of a certain superheroine. As they set up their campsite, trying their best to set aside their evil plans for a moment, they realized that one among them, Whammer, their lovable but somewhat simple-minded bruiser, seemed to be missing. They called out his name, but there was no answer. Concerned, they began to search for him, calling out louder in hopes that he would hear their voices. Whammer, however, was busy chasing a vibrant butterfly that had caught his attention. He ran with all his might, his eyes fixed on the fluttering creature. Lost in the excitement, he didn't realize just how far he had wandered from the rest of the group. As he dashed through the forest, Whammer stumbled upon a clearing. In the middle of it lay a motionless deer, its eyes closed peacefully. Whammer's eyes widened with curiosity as he approached the beautiful creature. He had only seen sleeping animals before, and he assumed that this majestic deer was taking a nap. With great care, Whammer gently poked the deer, expecting it to stir awake at any moment. But when it remained motionless, he began to panic. His heart raced, and he felt his breath catch in his throat. Whammer's limited understanding of death, much like that of a young child, sparked fear within him. Terrified, Whammer turned and sprinted back towards his friends. He rushed through the forest, crashing through bushes and tripping over roots. Tears welled up in his eyes as he thought about the deer, hoping his friends could help bring it back to life. By the time Whammer reached the campsite, he was sobbing uncontrollably. His friends, Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, Theodore \\"Tobey\\" McCallister III, and Victoria Best, were startled by his distress. They gathered around him, their eyes filled with concern. Chuck, always the one with a warm heart for Whammer, knelt down and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. \\"What's wrong, Whammer? Why are you crying?\\" he asked gently. Whammer struggled to catch his breath between sobs as he managed to articulate, \\"Deer... de-dead... asleep... scared.\\" Tobey's face softened, realizing what had happened. He had always been the most often in touch with his emotions. \\"Oh, Whammer,\\" he said, kneeling down beside him. \\"Sometimes, when animals die, they don't wake up. It's a natural part of life. The deer won't feel any pain anymore, but it won't be able to wake up or move again.\\" Whammer's tears continued to flow, but a glimmer of understanding began to edge into his troubled mind. His friends sat with him, providing support and consolation, ensuring that he knew he wasn't alone in his sadness. Victoria, usually looking out for her own agenda, couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for Whammer. She gently wiped away his tears, whispering, \\"It's okay to cry, Whammer. You cared for the deer, and it's natural to feel sad when something you care about is gone.\\" As the villains surrounded Whammer, they created a safe space for him to express his emotions. They listened, empathized, and offered words of reassurance, assuring him that he was not alone in his grief. As the sun began to set, casting a warm, golden hue over the campsite, Whammer's tears slowly subsided. His friends stayed close, comforting him until he felt ready to move on. Whammer began to understand that death was a part of life, a cycle that all living things experienced. From that day on, Whammer held a special place in his heart for all creatures, big and small. Whenever he saw an animal, alive or sleeping, he treated it with newfound gentleness and respect. His friends marveled at the change in him, and even though they were villains, they couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in Whammer's growth.

Она безусловна, во-первых, потому, что направлена на верховную и самостоятельную ценность, которая не служит уже ничему высшему, но сама составляет последнюю цель человеческой жизни. Человеку стоит жить на свете только для того, чтобы быть духом или служить духу; вне этого жизнь его бесцельна и унизительна. Зато воля, направленная на этот, безусловный по своему значению, предмет, не нуждается ни в оправдании, ни в обосновании: она вполне права и объективно права и в этом смысле безусловна. Она безусловна, во-вторых, потому, что присуща каждому человеку, независимо от условий места, времени и национальности. Нет человека, который был бы лишен ее; ибо она составляет essentiale37 «человека». Антропоморфное существо, вполне свободное от нее, могло бы быть подведено под species homo38 только с зоологической точки зрения. Воля к духу универсальна, во-первых, по составу тех субъектов, которым она присуща и правосознание которых она, так или иначе, мотивирует. Она живет во всех людях, то сосредоточиваясь на пустой форме духа, то изнемогая от его неоформленного содержания, проявляясь всегда с бесконечным разнообразием и разноценностью. Воинственность, татуировка, тотемизм дикаря свидетельствуют по-своему о ее незрелости, так же как зрелость ее обнаруживается в «декларации прав человека и гражданина»39, в картине Леонардо или в философском учении Гегеля. Она универсальна, во-вторых, по составу тех субъектов, которых она признает, включая их в сферу правового общения и единения. Воля к духу40 есть воля ко всем его индивидуальным очагам, уже угасшим и еще не возгоревшимся, действительным и возможным. Она выводит душу за условные пределы всякой исторически сложившейся социальной группы и заставляет человека реально испытать и осознать общечеловеческую взаимную связь естественно-правового характера. Воля к духу имеет значение «для всех», но не в том смысле, что все фактически знают о ней и сознательно живут ею, а в том смысле, что все должны жить ею и могут предаться ей как высшему. Ее правота и значение не зависят от субъективного признания и непризнания; она субъективна по истоку и явлению, но объективна по ценности и предмету. И вот именно безусловность ее значения возносит ее в ту сферу, где раскрываются горизонты универсального, общечеловеческого объема. Движимый предметною волею к Духу, человек незаметно для себя вовлекается в естественно-правовой порядок общечеловеческого братства. Каждый из всего сонма индивидуальных духов воспринимается им как живое жилище любимого и желанного предмета, как самостоятельный и самобытный очаг духовной жизни. Прикрепленный к каждому из этих духовных очагов нитями естественно-правовой и положительно-правовой корреляции, он признает эту правовую связь, уважает ее и поддерживает как необходимое условие своей и чужой духовной жизни. Таким образом, основа нормального правосознания делает человека членом единой всемирной правовой общины – «гражданином вселенной». По-видимому, для такого правосознания деление людей на особые правовые – территориальные, национальные, государственные – общины не может иметь значения. Всякое такое единение людей покоится на раздроблении всемирной правовой общины, так что единый и безусловный естественный правопорядок делится на множество частных и условных положительных правопорядков. Но это условное деление – если оно лишено всяких духовных оснований – бессильно отменить естественную всемирную связь людей. Духовное братство и естественно-правовая связанность не угасают и не могут угаснуть оттого, что человечество за все века своего существования не сумело организовать устойчивое всемирное единение на основе положительного международного права. Нормальное правосознание живет и руководится, прежде всего, естественно-правовыми отношениями, созерцая через них положительный правопорядок и не позволяя положительному праву угашать безусловное силою привычных условностей. Итак, по-видимому, «гражданин вселенной» не может быть патриотом; и отвергающий родину «интернационализм» является последним словом нормального правосознания. Однако такое решение было бы совершенно неверным. Действительно, проблема патриотизма должна быть поставлена и разрешена в терминах нормального правосознания. Иметь родину – значит иметь особый, самостоятельный естественно-правовой союз, не совпадающий со всемирной, общечеловеческой общиной, и отдавать ему преимущество в деле любви и служения. Этот союз покоится на некой преимущественной духовной однородности и близости людей; а духовная однородность создает то преимущественное, – жизненное и действенное, – патриотическое единение, которое имеет всегда естественно-правовой характер, но в большинстве случаев изливается и в положительно-правовую организацию. Патриотическое единение людей имеет в корне духовную природу, слагаясь и протекая в формах права и государства. Это может быть выражено так, что истинный патриотизм родится из того же источника, как и нормальное правосознание: из духовной природы человека и из воли к духу. Любовь патриота посвящена тому же предмету, которому служит право: духовной жизни, ее устроению и расцвету. Но питая духовную волю из глубины силою страстного чувства, патриотизм в то же время сосредоточивает ее на особом, частном предмете и явно ограничивает объем ее непосредственного действия; и вот это-то патриотическое ограничение воли к духу должно быть осмыслено и оправдано в своем существе. Патриотизм должен быть обоснован как необходимое и правое проявление воли к духу. Для разрешения этой задачи недостаточно установить его эмпирическую необходимость и его приемлемость для положительного правосознания; то и другое не вскрывает еще самого основного и глубокого корня любви к отечеству.","completion":"В данном тексте рассматривается концепция \\"воли к духу\\" как основы правосознания. Основные идеи, представленные в тексте: 1. **Безусловность воли к духу**: Воля к духу является безусловной, потому что она нацелена на высшее значение и самостоятельную ценность, которая сама по себе является конечной целью человеческой жизни, и потому что она присуща каждому человеку, независимо от условий их жизни. 2. **Универсальность воли к духу**: Воля к духу считается универсальной потому что она живет в каждом человеке и проявляется разнообразно и способствует развитию правосознания у различных субъектов. 3. **Общечеловеческая связь**: Воля к духу пробуждает ощущение общечеловеческой связи, выходящей за пределы социальных групп, и ведет к натурально-правовому взаимопониманию и братству среди людей. 4. **Воля к духу как основа правосознания**: Воля к духу определяет человека как члена всеобщего правового сообщества, и правосознание, основанное на воле к духу, не зависит от признания или непризнания, поскольку она объективна по своей ценности. 5. **Воля к духу и патриотизм**: Это обсуждение вопроса, может ли \\"гражданин вселенной\\" быть истинно патриотичным. Автор размышляет о том, что патриотизм проистекает из тех же духовных истоков, что и нормальное правосознание, и что истинный патриотизм должен быть осмыслен и признан как необходимое проявление воли к духу, а также должен быть соотнесен с духовной природой человека. В целом, автор текста стремится к объединению понятия воли к духу с пониманием правосознания, подчеркивая их безусловную и универсальную значимость для общечеловеческой связи и духовного братства, и обращает внимание на то, что отношение к патриотизму должно опираться на те же основания."},{"prompt":"Эмпирические условия человеческой жизни делают необходимым разделение всемирной общины на особые – территориальные, национальные и государственные – общины. Пространственная разбросанность человечества по лицу Земли и хозяйственная необходимость оседлого труда и оседлой жизни являются первою основою этого разделения: человеческому роду неизбежно жить в виде множества пространственно-дифференцированных провинций. Единая, общая всему человечеству, внешняя основа существования (прежде всего – пространство и земля) не только объединяет людей, но и разъединяет их: спаянные кровною и родовою связью группы людей незаметно вовлекаются в местные, ограниченные задания и постепенно вырабатывают местный, ограниченный способ размежевания и упорядочения индивидуальных притязаний и кругов. Климат и раса естественно закрепляют эту пространственную дифференциацию и интеграцию человечества; хозяйственное разделение труда и обмен продуктами воспитывают волю к единению и устроению; сходство интересов, быта и привычек завершает эту спайку, а совместная организация обороны выковывает власть и дисциплину. Так слагается целый ряд независимых правовых центров, государственных общин и положительных правопорядков. Инстинкт самосохранения, краткосрочность личной жизни и ограниченность индивидуальной восприимчивости заставляют человека со всеми его жизненными содержаниями примениться всецело к одной определенной социальной группе, искать опоры и взаимопомощи именно у нее и только у нее в ущерб и в противоположность общечеловеческому единению. Нужда и страх вызывают к жизни первые проблески «патриотизма», но эмпирическая неизбежность такой «любви к отечеству» не говорит еще ничего о ее духовной сущности и о ее философском обосновании. Положительное правосознание может сообщить такому патриотизму уже некоторую духовную санкцию. Гетерономный правопорядок, объединяющий одну единую территориальную, национальную или хозяйственную общину, разрешает в своих пределах и по-своему духовную задачу естественного права: он воспитывает человека к идее объективно-значащего порядка, основанного на совместности и взаимности и ведущего к свободе и справедливости. Единение, построенное на нужде и страхе, получает в этом элементарно-духовное и моральное освящение. Человек, выросший в известном правопорядке, сознает себя всецело обязанным правосознанию своих граждан и правовой культуре своего отечества: родина получает для него значение положительно-правового установления, уже обеспечившего его существование и ныне ограждающего его духовную жизнь. Благодаря этому принадлежность к известному государственному союзу начинает определяться уже не только нуждою и страхом, но чувством долга, чести и признательности. Житейский интерес «патриота» приобретает моральный смысл, а тяготение к родине – естественно-правовую основу. Правда, государственный союз, воспитывая своих граждан, урезывает естественно-правовую взаимность, ограничивая ее объемом единой общины. Однако правовое единение внутри государства отнюдь не исключает правового общения, уходящего за его пределы: государственный патриотизм устанавливает преимущественность правовой культуры, но отнюдь не исключительность ее. Граждане других общин и государств остаются по принципу правоспособными субъектами, и всемирное единение народов на основе международного права признается очередным заданием человечества: это единение слагается долго и медленно, восходя от малого к большому, от периферии к центру, от множества положительных правопорядков к единому положительному правопорядку. Однако все эти соображения не вскрывают еще самого основного и глубокого корня патриотической любви, расторгающей всемирное естественное братство – и чувством, и волею, и действием. Любовь к родине должна быть осмыслена как творческий акт духовного самоопределения, ибо только в этом виде своем она достигает истинной высоты и зрелости, сообщая последнюю санкцию и «нужде», и «долгу», и «чести», и «признательности». Для того чтобы любить свое отечество, его необходимо найти и реально испытать, что оно есть действительно «мое отечество». По-видимому, это испытание дается большинству людей без поисков, в результате естественно и незаметно слагающейся привычки к окружающим их условиям жизни. Но именно благодаря этому духовная сущность патриотизма остается очень часто неосознанной. Любовь к родине живет в душах в виде неразумной, предметно неопределенной склонности, которая то совсем замирает и теряет свою силу при отсутствии «надлежащего раздражения», то вспыхивает слепою и противоразумною страстью, не помнящею духовного родства, блуждающею в темноте, заглушающею и зовы доброй воли, и голос правосознания. Этот слепой аффект разделяет участь всех аффектов, над уяснением и очищением которых человек не работает: он незаметно вырождается и унижает человека. Он вырождается то в пустую форму воинственного шовинизма и тупого национального самомнения, то в слепое пристрастие к эмпирическим второстепенностям, то в лицемерный пафос, прикрывающий личную или классовую корысть. Человек, скрывающий в себе такой патриотизм, не знает ни того, что он любит, ни того, за что он это любит. Он следует не духовно-политическим мотивам, а стадно-политическому инстинкту; и жизнь его чувства колеблется, как у настоящего животного, между бесплодною апатиею и хищным порывом. Человек может прожить всю жизнь в пределах своего государства и не обрести своей родины, так что душа его будет до конца патриотически пустынна и мертва; и эта неудача или неспособность приведет его к своеобразному духовному сиротству, к творческой беспочвенности и бесплодности. Ибо обретение родины есть акт духовного самоопределения, указывающий человеку его собственную творческую почву и обусловливающий поэтому духовную плодотворность его жизни. Такой человек не будет любить свою родину, потому что он ее не обрел. Но может быть и так, что человек, не обретший свою родину, проживет всю жизнь, ошибочно считая себя патриотом, тогда предметом его любви будет не отечество, а что-то иное, принимаемое им за отечество. Таким суррогатом может быть любое из обычных содержаний и условий жизни, поскольку оно берется самостоятельно, в отрыве от своего духовного смысла и значения. Ни одно из них, взятое само по себе, не составляет «родины»: ни пространственное рядом-жительство людей, ни кровная связь происхождения, ни национальная и расовая принадлежность, ни привычный быт, ни хозяйственное единение, ни природа, ни общность положительного права и государства. Наличность каждого из этих условий не укажет еще человеку его духовной родины, и обратно: патриотизм может сложиться при отсутствии любого из этих содержаний. Долгая жизнь на чужбине не делает ее родиной, несмотря на привычку к быту и природе и на устойчивое правовое общение; кровная и национальная связь не выясняет вопроса о родине для людей смешанного происхождения; принадлежность к государству может быть недобровольной и создавать в душе устойчивое «анти-патриотическое» напряжение. Это значит, что родина не определяется и не исчерпывается этими содержаниями: она больше и глубже, чем каждое из них в отдельности и все они вместе. Вот почему образ Роджера Вильямса41, порывающего со всем, что обычно считается отечеством, и создающего себе новую, истинную родину, останется навсегда живым призывом к углубленному пониманию патриотизма.","completion":"Этот текст продолжает тему воли к духу в контексте патриотизма и представляет аргументы о природе национального и территориального разделения человеческой общности. Основные аспекты изложенные в тексте: 1. **Эмпирическая необходимость разделения человечества**: Человечество естественно разделилось на отдельные сообщества из-за условий среды обитания, требования оседлого образа жизни и хозяйственной необходимости. Это разделение по условиям жизни со временем углубляется расовыми и климатическими особенностями, а также хозяйственными отношениями. 2. **Формирование государств**: Человеческие сообщества, объединяемые потребностями, страхом и хозяйственной взаимозависимостью, постепенно вырастают в независимые государства с собственными правопорядками. 3. **Патриотизм и положительное правосознание**: Эмпирические условия рождают примитивный патриотизм, основанный на нужде и страхе. В рамках государственного устройства, патриотизм приобретает положительную правовую форму и начинает ассоциироваться с чувством долга, чести и благодарности. 4. **Ограниченность государственного патриотизма**: Автор подчеркивает, что государственная принадлежность ограничивает общечеловеческую связанность, но не исключает возможности международного правового общения и дальнейшего объединения народов на основе международного права. 5. **Поиск истинной родины и творческое самоопределение**: Автор утверждает, что настоящий патриотизм требует глубокого духовного самоопределения и поиска связи с «истинной родиной», которая не обязательно совпадает с тем местом, где человек ведет свою повседневную жизнь. В целом, текст освещает способы, которыми разделение на отдельные сообщества и создание государств влияют на формирование патриотизма. Автор призывает к более глубокому размышлению о духовной сущности патриотизма, отделяя истинную любовь к родине от простого привыкания к жизненным обстоятельствам и поверхностных форм патриотизма, таких как национальное самомуление или шовинизм."},{"prompt":"Yapay zeka da ileri beslemeli ağlar nedir","completion":"Yapay zeka (artificial intelligence, AI) ve makine öğrenimi (machine learning, ML) içinde \\"ileri beslemeli ağlar\\" (feedforward networks) terimi genellikle yapay sinir ağları içindeki en basit ve yaygın ağ türlerinden birini ifade etmek için kullanılır. İleri beslemeli ağlar, girdi verisini alır ve bir dizi işlemden geçirerek çıktı verisini üretir. Bu işlemler sırasında veri, ağın katmanları içinde sadece ileri yönde, yani girdi katmanından çıktı katmanına doğru akar. Bu süreçte geriye doğru bir akış olmadığı için bu tür ağlara \\"ileri beslemeli\\" denir. İleri beslemeli ağlar genellikle bir veya daha fazla gizli katman içerir ve her katman bir öncekinden bağımsızdır. Her katmandaki nöronlar yalnızca bir önceki katmandaki nöronlarla bağlantılıdır ve daha sonraki katmanların nöronlarına bağlantı sağlar. Nöronlar arası bağlantı ağırlıkları, eğitim süresince verileri temsil etmeyi öğrenmek için sürekli olarak güncellenir. İleri beslemeli ağların temel özellikleri ve bileşenleri şunları içerir: 1. Girdi Katmanı (Input Layer): Bu katman, ağa girdi olarak verilen veri setinin özelliklerini (features) alır. 2. Gizli Katmanlar (Hidden Layers): Bu katmanlar, girdiyi işlemek üzere çeşitli hesaplamalar ve dönüşümler gerçekleştirir. Bir ağ birden çok gizli katmana sahip olabilir. 3. Çıktı Katmanı (Output Layer): İşlenmiş veri bu katmanda sonuca dönüştürülür ve ağın nihai çıktısını oluşturur. 4. Aktivasyon Fonksiyonu: Her bir nöronun çıktısını hesaplamak için kullanılan matematiksel fonksiyondur. Örnek olarak sigmoid, tanh, ReLU fonksiyonları verilebilir. 5. Ağırlıklar (Weights) ve Önyargılar (Biases): Her nöron arası bağlantının gücünü ve her bir nöron için önyargı değerini belirleyen parametrelerdir. Yapay sinir ağları, özellikle derin öğrenme (deep learning) alanında yaygın olarak kullanılır ve sınıflandırma, regresyon, desen tanıma ve daha pek çok karmaşık problemi çözmek için uygulanır.

Geri yayılım, ağın çıktılarını ve beklenen doğru sonuçları karşılaştırarak oluşan hataları ağ yapısında geriye doğru yaymak suretiyle ağın ağırlık ve biaslarını güncelleyerek öğrenmesini sağlar. Geri yayılım işlemi genellikle aşağıdaki adımları içerir: 1. İleri Besleme (Feedforward): Giriş verileri ağın giriş katmanından başlayarak, içinde bulunan her katmandaki nöronlar tarafından işlenir. Her bir katmanda nöronların aktivasyonu, giriş ağırlıklarıyla çarpılarak ve aktivasyon fonksiyonlarından geçirilerek hesaplanır ve çıktı katmanına doğru ilerletilir. 2. Hata Hesaplaması: Ağın çıktı katmanında üretilen sonuçlar beklenen sonuçlar (etiketler, gerçek değerler) ile karşılaştırılarak bir hata değeri hesaplanır. Bu hata genellikle bir kayıp fonksiyonu (loss function) ile ifade edilir, örneğin ortalama karesel hata (mean squared error) veya çapraz entropi kaybı (cross-entropy loss). 3. Geri Yayılım: Hesaplanan hata, kaynaklandığı yere (ağırlıklara ve biaslara) göre dağıtılarak, hatanın hangi ağırlıkların ve biasların değiştirilmesi gerektiğine dair bilgi elde edilir. Bu dağıtım önce çıktı katmanından başlar ve gizli katmanlara doğru geriye doğru ilerler. Her bir katmanda, hataya katkıda bulunan ağırlıkların nasıl ayarlanması gerektiği hesaplanır. Hata türevi zincir kuralı kullanılarak ağırlıkların ne kadar ve hangi yönde değiştirilmesi gerektiğini belirler. 4. Ağırlık ve Bias Güncellemesi: Hesaplanan gradyanlar kullanılarak, ağın ağırlıkları ve biasları güncellenir. Bu genellikle gradyan inişi (gradient descent) veya onun varyantları kullanılarak yapılır. Öğrenme oranı (learning rate), bu güncellemelerin büyüklüğünü kontrol eder. Geri yayılım işleminin temel avantajlarından biri, bir yapay sinir ağının çok sayıda ağırlık ve biasına ilişkin hatayı etkili bir şekilde hesaplayabilmesidir. Bu sayede, derin sinir ağları gibi karmaşık yapılar dahi eğitilebilir hale gelir.

Since you have a \`Vec<String>\` with \\"gene\\" lines (in \`coords\`) and a \`Vec<Vec<String>>\` with other features like \\"transcripts\\", \\"exons\\", and \\"CDS\\" lines (contained within \`results\`), you can take the following steps: 1. Flatten \`results\` into a single \`Vec<String>\`. 2. Combine with \`coords\`. 3. Parse each line to extract chromosome and start position. 4. Sort the combined list based on chromosome and start position. 5. Write to file or otherwise use the sorted data. Here's how you might implement this in Rust: \`\`\`rust use rayon::prelude::*; use std::collections::HashMap; // Your existing functions would go here... // Additional utility function to parse a GTF line and extract the sorting key (chr, start position) fn parse_gtf_line_for_sorting(line: &str) -> Option<(&str, u32)> { let fields: Vec<&str> = line.split('t').collect(); if fields.len() > 3 { let chr = fields[0]; let start = fields[3].parse::<u32>().ok()?; Some((chr, start)) } else { None // Return None for lines that don't conform to the expected format } } fn main() { // As before, populate these as necessary let iso: HashMap<String, String> = HashMap::new(); let gene_track: HashMap<String, (String, u32, u32, String)> = HashMap::new(); let bed: Vec<String> = Vec::new(); // Presumably you have BED records as Strings here // Your two main operations producing the original Vectors let coords = combine_maps_par(&iso, &gene_track); let results: Vec<Vec<String>> = bed.par_iter().map(|record| to_gtf(&record, &iso)).collect(); // Flatten the nested Vec<Vec<String>> into a single Vec<String> let flattened_results: Vec<String> = results.into_iter().flatten().collect(); // Combine coords and flattened_results into one Vec<String> let mut combined = [coords, flattened_results].concat(); // Sort the combined Vec<String> by parsing each line to get the sorting key combined.par_sort_unstable_by(|a, b| { let a_key = parse_gtf_line_for_sorting(a); let b_key = parse_gtf_line_for_sorting(b); a_key.cmp(&b_key) }); // You can now write the sorted combined vector to a file or process it further for line in combined { println!(\\"{}\\", line); } } // Your combine_maps_par and to_gtf functions would be similar to what's been previously discussed \`\`\` In this modified \`main\` function, we first flatten the \`results\` with \`into_iter().flatten().collect()\`. Then we combine both \`coords\` and \`flattened_results\` vectors with \`[coords, flattened_results].concat()\`. The \`par_sort_unstable_by\` function is used to sort the combined data in parallel. To facilitate the sorting, we define a utility function \`parse_gtf_line_for_sorting\` that extracts the chromosome and start position from each line, which acts as the sorting key. If a line does not conform to the expected GTF format and cannot be parsed, it is ignored during sorting. Using parallel sorting (\`par_sort_unstable_by\`) from the \`rayon\` crate can significantly speed up the sorting of large data, but it's worth noting that \\"unstable\\" sorting does not preserve the order of equal elements. If this order is important, consider using \`par_sort_by\` instead. Finally, you can iterate through the sorted \`combined\` vector to write the output to a file or process it further."},{"prompt":"please help me finish this function: let mut combined = [coords, flattened_results].concat(); // Sort the combined vector combined.par_sort_unstable_by(|a, b| { let chr_cmp = compare(&a[0..2], &b[0..2]); if chr_cmp == std::cmp::Ordering::Equal { let start_a: u32 = a[]; let start_b: u32 = b[]; start_a.cmp(&start_b) } else { chr_cmp } });","completion":"Certainly! To complete the sorting function, we need to extract the chromosome and start position from each GTF line within the \`combined\` vector. Since GTF lines are tab-delimited, we can split each line on the tab character and retrieve the necessary fields to perform our comparison. Below is the completed sorting function, assuming that the chromosome is the first field in the string and the start position is the fourth field: \`\`\`rust let mut combined = [coords, flattened_results].concat(); // Sort the combined vector combined.par_sort_unstable_by(|a, b| { // Assuming a standard GTF format, split lines on tabs and parse chromosome and start let fields_a: Vec<&str> = a.split('t').collect(); let fields_b: Vec<&str> = b.split('t').collect(); // Compare chromosomes first let chr_cmp = fields_a[0].cmp(&fields_b[0]); if chr_cmp == std::cmp::Ordering::Equal { // If chromosomes are equal, compare start positions match (fields_a.get(3), fields_b.get(3)) { (Some(start_a_str), Some(start_b_str)) => { // Parse start positions as u32 for comparison let start_a: u32 = start_a_str.parse().unwrap_or(0); let start_b: u32 = start_b_str.parse().unwrap_or(0); start_a.cmp(&start_b) }, _ => std::cmp::Ordering::Equal, // If parsing fails just consider them equal } } else { chr_cmp } }); \`\`\` In this function, each GTF line is split into its component fields using the \`split\` method and the tab character as a delimiter. We compare the chromosome fields first. If the chromosomes are equal, we then compare start positions. We retrieve the start position (which is in the fourth field in a GTF line) and use \`parse\` to convert it into a \`u32\`. The \`parse\` function could fail if the field does not contain a valid number, so we use \`.unwrap_or(0)\` to provide a default value of \`0\` to facilitate comparison. This sorting block assumes the standard format of a GTF line with fields ordered as chromosome, source, feature type, start, end, score, strand, and frame, separated by tabs. Adjust the indices accordingly if your data is in a different format. Finally, this sorting function uses \`par_sort_unstable_by\` from Rayon for parallel sorting, improving performance on large datasets. However, do remember that the order of records with equal sorting keys would not be preserved due to the \\"unstable\\" nature of this sort. If that is undesired, use \`par_sort_by\` for stable sorting while still benefiting from parallel execution."},{"prompt":"is that the most efficient and fastest way?","completion":"The code I provided uses parallel sorting with the Rayon crate, which is an efficient way to sort large datasets in Rust. Parallel sorting makes use of multiple CPU cores, which can greatly speed up the process over a single-threaded sort. However, efficiency isn't solely about using parallel algorithms; it can also be about optimizing the operations that happen during sorting. We can improve the sorting process in a few ways: 1. Reduce the number of string splits and parses. 2. Avoid repetitive processing by pre-computing the sorting keys. 3. Use lightweight string comparison for chromosomes. Below is an improved version of the sort function that implements these optimizations: \`\`\`rust use std::cmp::Ordering; // Structure to hold precomputed sorting keys struct SortKey<'a> { chrom: &'a str, // We hold a reference to avoid copying start: u32, // Parsed start position } // This function generates a SortKey for sorting fn get_sort_key(line: &str) -> Option<SortKey> { let fields: Vec<&str> = line.split('t').collect(); // Ensure we have enough fields and correctly parse the start position if fields.len() > 3 { // Avoid re-parsing the chromosome and start for every comparison if let Ok(start) = fields[3].parse::<u32>() { return Some(SortKey { chrom: fields[0], start, }); } } None } // Parallely precompute the sorting keys for each line let sort_keys: Vec<Option<SortKey>> = combined .par_iter() .map(|line| get_sort_key(line)) .collect(); // Sort the combined vector using precomputed sort keys combined.par_sort_unstable_by(|a, b| { let key_a = &sort_keys[combined.iter().position(|x| x == a).unwrap()]; let key_b = &sort_keys[combined.iter().position(|x| x == b).unwrap()]; match (key_a, key_b) { (Some(key_a), Some(key_b)) => { // First, compare chromosomes let chr_cmp = key_a.chrom.cmp(&key_b.chrom); if chr_cmp == Ordering::Equal { // If chromosomes are equal, compare start positions key_a.start.cmp(&key_b.start) } else { chr_cmp } } // Handle lines that do not conform to GTF format _ => Ordering::Equal, } }); // Now, 'combined' is sorted and can be used as needed \`\`\` In this improved sorting function: 1. We define a \`SortKey\` struct to hold a reference to the chromosome as a string slice (avoiding string copying) and the parsed start position as a \`u32\`. 2. We map each line to its associated \`SortKey\`, pre-computing the sorting keys for all lines before sorting. 3. We sort using these \`SortKey\`s, which significantly reduces the amount of work (and possible allocation) for each comparison. The \`get_sort_key\` function parses the fields once, and that's the last time we need to do so for sorting purposes.

Having the same understanding of death as a child, Whammer gently pokes the deer, thinking it’s asleep. When it isn’t moving, he panics and runs to get the others, hoping they can help because he doesn't know it's dead and thinks something is wrong. When they tell him the deer isn’t alive, he starts crying and they have to comfort him.","completion":"Once upon a time in the city of Fair City, the Wordgirl villains decided to take a break from their mischievous adventures. Dr. Two-Brains, Granny May, and The Amazing Rope Guy decided to go on a camping trip deep in the heart of Whispering Woods. Joining them was Whammer, the villains' lovable bruiser, known for his oversized hands and his gentle, childlike nature. As they set up their campsite, the villains couldn't help but notice Whammer's excitement. His eyes lit up at the sight of the towering trees, the glistening stream, and the fluttering butterflies dancing in the sunshine. Whammer's fascination with the natural world was infectious, and the other villains were eager to see him enjoy the trip. One bright morning, as they were preparing breakfast by the crackling campfire, a captivating butterfly caught Whammer's attention. Its vibrant wings flapped gracefully in the air, inviting Whammer to chase after it. Losing himself in the excitement of the chase, Whammer dashed through the trees, leaving his camping companions behind. In his exuberant pursuit, Whammer stumbled upon a clearing nestled deep within the woods. There, he found a motionless figure lying on the ground. Its coat was as gray as the bark on the trees, and it appeared to be resting peacefully. Thinking it was asleep, Whammer carefully approached the figure and gently poked its side. To his surprise, the deer didn't stir. Confusion filled Whammer's heart as he poked it again, a little harder. The deer remained still, its once lively eyes now empty and vacant. Overwhelmed with worry, Whammer's eyes welled up with tears as he sprinted back to the campsite, desperate for help. Reaching the campsite, Whammer found his fellow villains sitting around the campfire, enjoying their breakfast. Breathless and panicked, he blurted out, \\"Something's wrong! Something's wrong with the deer!\\" Doctor Two-Brains exchanged a concerned glance with Granny May and The Amazing Rope Guy. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, they immediately followed Whammer back to the clearing. The villains' footsteps echoed through the woods as they hurriedly made their way to the motionless deer. Standing there, surrounded by the villains, Whammer pointed at the deer with trembling hands, tears streaming down his face. \\"It won't wake up! I don't understand. Why won't it wake up?\\" Gently placing a hand on Whammer's shoulder, Granny May knelt down beside him. With a soft voice, she explained, \\"Whammer, we're so sorry, but the deer is not asleep. It's... it's gone. It won't wake up because it's... it's dead.\\" Confusion and sadness filled Whammer's teary eyes as he looked at Granny May. He couldn't comprehend what she was saying. Death was a concept foreign to him, just like a child who had yet to grasp the finality of it all. The weight of the moment sank in, bringing forth a wave of grief and despair within poor Whammer. Whammer let out a heart-wrenching cry, his oversized hands covering his face as the tears flowed freely. The other villains brought him into a warm, comforting embrace. They held him close, soothing him with their words, letting him know that it was okay to feel sad and confused. As they sat in the clearing, surrounded by the beauty of Whispering Woods, the villains made sure Whammer understood that death was a natural part of life. They answered his questions, comforting him with their love and understanding. The villains, in their own unique way, helped Whammer find solace in the memories he had with the deer. From that day forward, Whammer, with the support of his friends, came to understand the circle of life and appreciate the fragility of every creature's journey. Together, they ventured forth, embracing both the joys and the sorrows that the world had to offer, standing united as the friendship among Wordgirl's villains grew stronger than ever before."},{"prompt":"Deep in the night, Whammer wakes up and quietly starts crying again. Granny May wakes up to his soft crying and tries to comfort him.","completion":"In the dark of the night, when the moon hung high and the stars twinkled above, Whammer's slumber was interrupted by a deep sadness that overwhelmed his heart once more. Tears trickled down his cheeks as he lay awake, his gentle sobs filling the silent forest. Just a few feet away, Granny May stirred in her sleep, her keen ears attuned to the sound of Whammer's stifled cries. Concern etched across her face, she rose from her slumber and made her way over to Whammer's side. She gently placed a hand on his arm, soothingly whispering, \\"Whammer, my dear, what's troubling you?\\" Startled by Granny May's presence, Whammer wiped away his tears, silently sniffling. \\"Granny May, I can't stop thinking about the deer. It's as if a heavy weight is pressing upon my heart. I miss it, and I don't know how to make this feeling go away.\\" Granny May settled down beside him, the warmth of her presence offering solace to Whammer's sorrowful soul. She spoke softly, her voice carrying tenderness and understanding. \\"Whammer, my sweet friend, grief takes time. It's understandable that you miss the deer—you formed a bond with it during your encounter. Remember, it's okay to feel sad, and it's okay to cry. Allow yourself to grieve.\\" Whammer sniffled, nodding his head in acknowledgment. \\"But Granny May, what if the sadness never goes away? What if I can never forget the deer? Does that mean something is wrong with me?\\" Granny May's eyes sparkled with compassion as she assured him, \\"My dear, there is nothing wrong with feeling this way. Memories of the deer will always hold a special place in your heart. But with time, the intensity of the sadness will soften, giving way to the warm memories you shared. Healing takes time, Whammer.\\" Whammer looked into Granny May's eyes, finding solace in her words. He realized he was not alone in his journey of grief. With a shaky voice, he asked, \\"Will I ever be able to smile and feel joy again, Granny May?\\" Granny May smiled warmly, her hand gently clasping Whammer's. \\"Yes, my dear Whammer. The beauty of life is that it is filled with both moments of joy and moments of sorrow. As time passes, you'll start to embrace the happiness once more, cherishing the memories of the deer while opening your heart to new experiences. We'll be here for you through it all.\\" Whammer's tears slowed, a glimmer of hope shining in his eyes. He felt Granny May's genuine love and support as she held his hand, assuring him that their bond was unbreakable. In the stillness of the night, Granny May offered him comfort, reminding him that healing was possible—a gentle reminder that even through grief, love and friendship remained steadfast. And so, as Whammer settled back into his sleep, his heart carried the weight of his loss, but it also held the promise of healing and the hope of brighter days to come. Granny May stayed by his side, a guiding presence that would never falter, reminding him that villains, too, could find solace and kindness in the world around them."},{"prompt":"Whammer wakes up before the others the next day and silently admires the morning, still grappling with his grief. Then he hears a snap, glances out to the side of their campsite and sees a whole group of deer staring back at him.

An air of tranquility surrounded him, yet the weight of his grief still lingered in his heart. While his fellow villains still slept soundly, Whammer quietly stepped out of the tent, hoping to find solace in the embrace of nature. As he stood outside, the whispering breeze gently caressed his tear-streaked face. Whammer's eyes gazed out into the wilderness, searching for a sense of peace amidst his turmoil. The forest seemed alive, its inhabitants preparing for a new day. Birds chirped harmoniously while squirrels scurried about, creating a symphony of sounds. Suddenly, a soft snap echoed through the woods, catching Whammer's attention. He turned his gaze towards the side of their campsite, where he saw a group of deer watching him with curious eyes. Their delicate frames stood still, as if acknowledging his presence. Whammer's heart skipped a beat, captivated by their grace and beauty. His sorrowful eyes locked with a massive buck at the front, his majestic antlers towering over the others. Whammer felt a connection, as if the buck understood his inner turmoil. Slowly, the buck approached, his strides cautious yet filled with a gentle confidence. Whammer's breath hitched as the buck stood before him, close enough to touch. A surge of warmth enveloped his heart as the buck leaned forward and gently pressed his wet nose against Whammer's cheek. It was a comforting gesture, a silent reassurance that love and understanding transcended the boundaries between species. Tears welled up in Whammer's eyes once more, but this time they were tears of gratitude and solace. He softly whispered, \\"Thank you,\\" his voice filled with sincerity and appreciation. The buck stared into Whammer's eyes for a brief moment, as if conveying a message of hope, before slowly retreating. The other deer followed suit, their gaze unwavering until they disappeared into the depths of the forest. Whammer stood there, his hand softly touching the spot where the buck had licked his face, feeling the weight of grief slowly lifting from his shoulders. In that silent encounter with the deer, Whammer realized that the memory of the deceased deer would always remain in his heart. But in that moment, as the gentle creatures bestowed their compassion upon him, he found solace in the knowledge that life continued to unfold, offering moments of connection, healing, and love. With a newfound sense of peace, Whammer made his way back to camp, a glimmer of a smile gracing his lips. He knew that he would forever cherish the memory of that morning, and the deer's gentle embrace would serve as a reminder that even in moments of grief, there was still beauty and kindness to be found.

Turning towards the sound, he saw a magnificent elk, larger and more majestic than the deer he had encountered earlier. The elk's eyes held a hint of curiosity as it cautiously followed the villains, clearly intrigued by their presence. Whammer's gaze locked with the elk's, his face lighting up with wonder and awe. It felt as if the grandeur of the creature resonated with the newfound peace that had started to settle within him. The elk's powerful strides matched the rhythm of Whammer's heart, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of kinship with this majestic being. As the villains continued their hike, the elk maintained its distance, observing their every move with gentle curiosity. Whammer, emboldened by the connection he felt, approached the elk, his eyes filled with admiration. \\"Hello, beautiful creature,\\" Whammer softly spoke, his voice carrying a mixture of respect and fascination. \\"We are the Wordgirl villains, and we've come to appreciate the magnificence of this forest. What brings you here?\\" The elk, recognizing Whammer's peaceful intent, stopped in its tracks and listened attentively. Its ears perked up, seemingly trying to understand the words spoken by this unexpected group. Whammer's words resonated with the spirit of the forest, and the elk's eyes gleamed in response.

Dr. Two-Brains was busy concocting his latest cheesy creation, while Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy was trying to perfect his ultimate sandwich recipe. Meanwhile, Lady Redundant Woman was practicing her mirror summoning skills and The Butcher was sharpening his knives. As they went about their usual villainous activities, they noticed Whammer sitting alone in a corner, his usually energetic demeanor replaced with a somber expression. Concerned, Lady Redundant Woman approached him and asked, \\"Hey Whammer, what's the matter? You seem upset.\\" Whammer sighed heavily and glanced up at his fellow villains. \\"Yesterday, I went for a walk in the woods outback, and I saw something that made me really sad,\\" he replied softly. Curiosity piqued, Chuck sat down beside Whammer and inquired, \\"What did you see, buddy?\\" Whammer hesitated for a moment before continuing. \\"I saw a dead deer. It was just lying there, motionless. It made me think about how unfair it is that such a beautiful creature had to die.\\" Lady Redundant Woman, understanding Whammer's sentiment, sat down as well and nodded in agreement. \\"I understand, Whammer. Death can be really tough to process sometimes. Nature can be both beautiful and cruel.\\" The Butcher, putting down his knives, joined the conversation too. \\"You're right, Whammer. Death is a part of life, but it doesn't make it any easier to accept. In fact, that's why I became a villain. I wanted to defy death and make sure nobody else had to face it.\\" Whammer looked up, appreciating the support from his comrades. \\"Thanks, guys. It means a lot that you understand. It's just hard to shake off the feeling of sadness.\\" Dr. Two-Brains, abandoning his cheesy experiment, joined the group. \\"Whammer, my friend, you're not alone in feeling this way. Even villains have emotions, and it's okay to be affected by the hardships we witness.\\" Chuck chimed in, eager to cheer up Whammer. \\"You're the strongest of all of us, but don't forget that strength is not just about physical power. It's also about overcoming emotional challenges.\\" Inspired by the words of his fellow villains, Whammer managed a small smile. \\"You're right, guys. Thank you for reminding me of that. I guess even the strongest need support sometimes.\\" In that moment, they formed an unlikely bond, recognizing the importance of acknowledging and understanding one another's emotions. And so, the Wordgirl villains found solace in their shared vulnerability, proving that even the most wicked can have a compassionate side. From that day forward, whenever any of them faced emotional trials, they could count on each other for support – whether it was grieving for a fallen animal or overcoming personal obstacles. And as the sun set on their hideout, the Wordgirl villains realized that even amidst their villainous endeavors, compassion had the power to bring them closer together as friends."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:q},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:j,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},W={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],L={key:0},R={key:1};function B(n,e,l,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),a("div",D,[(t(!0),i(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(t(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),i("div",W,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
